unfortunately been characterized by slow or even negative economic progress in recent decades Poland is a fascinating economy for a number of reasons not least of which is that by all metrics it shouldn't really be as successful as it is and that the economy is Shifting so rapidly that there is a good chance that the demographic statistics we just listed are already wildly out of date but more on that later Poland's economic performance may be strong when compared to its peers in the European Union but it's outstanding when compared to its former Soviet neighbors up to and including Russia which is a country with a much larger labor pool far more natural resources and more International influence despite this where Russia and a lot of other former Soviet States fumbled the transition to market-based globally Cooperative economies Poland succeeded despite dealing with modern historical challenges that were unmatched anywhere else in the world if Poland's current rate of industrial growth continues it could be one of the largest economies in Europe which has the potential to be a vital Lifeline for the European Union as it struggles with sustained economic stagnation amongst many key member states outside of just being a nice good news story Poland's economic success is also an invaluable case study that could potentially be applied to other countries around the world especially those on both sides of the invasion of Ukraine now no country exists without problems and while Poland's economic growth has been nothing short of remarkable it's still poor country by European standards and it's only just starting to break into the global upper middle class this is a period of development where countries are typically at their most vulnerable and even minor economic shocks can undo decades worth of progress there is no reason to believe that Poland won't be susceptible to the same challenges of Shifting demographics the expectations of sustained growth and getting out competed by the other countries that can do the same thing for the same price the country also faces some very real challenges that are unique to just Poland its geopolitical neighborhood is not awesome part of the reason that it makes for such a great case study is because it's so geographically close to the countries that are going to need to learn its lessons while the chance of Poland actually being invaded is extremely slim the situation does still present major challenges for the rapidly developing economy but if it can address these problems it may genuinely have a shot at being one of the world's wealthiest and most influential economies potentially even rivaling its neighbors Germany on a per capita basis so how did Poland get to where it is today why do economists find development so outstanding could the same lessons be applied to other countries that are completely economically crippled and finally could its current set of challenges undo decades worth of progress once we've done all of that we can as always put Poland one of Europe's Rising economic miracles on the economics explained National leaderboard while our team at e had been

take a lot of pressure off your work today the economy of Poland as it exists today really got its start in 1990 before that while the Country Wasn't technically a state of the Soviet Union it fell effectively under their control as it was led by a communist government indirectly picked by Moscow in 1989 with the failing dominance of the Soviet Union the country elected a new party for the first time since the old government was ousted during the country's invasion in the second world war the new government set about the process of doing what a lot of former Soviet states in the region including Russia itself were doing privatizing in the Communist economic system of the Soviet States and by extension Poland almost all industries were state-owned with very few exceptions as these countries transitioned to free market economies these state-owned departments needed to be changed into private companies this was a surprisingly challenging process in all of the countries because it becomes difficult to decide who gets what in established free market economy state-owned assets are sold off all the time a simple search of government privatizers should deliver a long list of articles about things like electrical grids highways and even state-owned banks that get sold off to private investors all the time this is sometimes controversial but there's nothing inherently wrong with doing this because often times private Enterprise with a profit motive and healthy competition can deliver better results and cost consumers less overall than public run organizations with no competition and no particular incentive to be any kind of efficient of course there is always a balance and the real economic debate is to be had over what Enterprises are best privatized and what are Best Kept as state Services rather than arguing that everything should be privatized or everything should be owned by the people but with that small tangent out of the way Poland did realize that its current extreme system of full State control over all industry was going to need a change this rapid process of privatization and Adoption of free markets came to be known as shock therapy because it was ultimately a necessary step for these countries but its rapid and somewhat haphazard Administration pushed all of the former Soviet States and Poland back significantly and by the 1990s none of these countries were doing too fantastic to begin with the former Soviet Union didn't fall apart because its economy was booming by the time of claiming effective Independence most of Poland's population lived in complete poverty and the country had a per capita output of around $1,200 similar to a country like Zimbabwe or or Pakistan today accounting for inflation now in Poland economists still refer to this process of privatization as shock therapy but it was a lot less shocking than it was in the other countries Poland didn't lose nearly as much economic capacity during the transition because its new government favored a slow and steady approach to changing from a centrally planned economy most large Industries remained under State Control initially and it wasn't until the mid 2000s that most major industries in the country were privately run instead of splitting up State assets and deciding who would get them in a process that let's be honest was wildly susceptible to corruption Poland adopted the philosophy of if Private Industry really was better and more efficient it would let its citizens Build It Up from scratch to compete with existing state owned Enterprises the theory was that if the private sector was so great it should have no problem out competing the large cumbersome state owned companies this strategy still achieved the same end goal of economic liberalization but when compared to the other countries Russia in particular it didn't create an environment where people could just bribe or subvert their way into being handed the country's resources they were simply liberated to go out and build wealth for themselves Poland does have far fewer natural resources than its ex Soviet neighbors so there was arguably less opportunity to hand natural resource wealth over to a small group of oligarchs but the slow and steady approach did mean that small local industries were allowed to grow basically from the beginning of Market transition the slower approach also made the country more economically stable because the landscape of the economy wasn't being changed overnight again in Russia by comparison people basically went to sleep in an economy where the state at least theoretically provided them with everything they needed and assign them specific responsibilities and then woke up in an economy where they had to figure everything out for themselves given this environment it's perhaps unsurprising that Russia was marred by such political instability in the years that followed and unfortunately this is a vicious feedback loop if a country is politically unstable Advanced Industries will struggle to get established there without advanced Industries the country will struggle with economic instability and if people are not looked after economically they're going to demand political change leading to further political instability Poland by contrast maintained enough political stability that it became one of the first former Soviet republics to become members of notoriously selective International groups like NATO and the European Union Beyond just getting its foot in the door to these big International groups the relative stability combined with the still far lower incomes demanded by polish workers at the time meant that it became a highly attractive destination for lowcost manufacturing major industrial European nations Germany and France in particular set up industrial relations with Poland to build less technical components for advanced end products like motor vehicles and airplanes Poland already had decent Manufacturing Industries in place and when it joined the European Union it became very easy for these countries to do business there and make the necessary Investments needed to modernize their existing factories instead of paying far more expensive French or German Workers to build basic parts that didn't need a lot of skill or Outsourcing that manufacturing to a country like China which was outside of the EU and therefore attracted significant import taxes it was much more cost effective to set up Manufacturing in Poland especially since it now shared a direct lamb order with a unified Germany Poland never adopted the Euro like other former Soviet states such as laia Lithuania and Estonia so there was that that made crossb business slightly more difficult but given its industrial potential it was still a more popular destination to set up industry although these other states have also benefited from this too just to a slightly lesser degree even today Poland trades almost exclusively with Europe and while that's been a great opportunity for the country and one of the primary drivers of its sustained economic growth it does have some drawbacks Poland has been able to grow its domestic economy by providing a larger amount of progressively more Technical and valuable exports to the big Eur European manufacturing Powers but there is an eventual limit to that the growth of the countries that Poland is selling its exports to have mostly been stagnant for more than a decade now which means eventually Poland is going to reach a limit on how much it can sell to these countries it could start exporting its manufactured goods to other countries around the world but it wouldn't be competing with the same advantages that it has when exporting stuff within the EU because the European Union taxes most Imports entering its borders but it doesn't tax any trade between member nations Poland didn't need to be the most globally competitive Nation to become regionally competitive as long as it could provide products that were cheaper than traditional centers of lowcost manufacturing after an import tariff it would keep an able to export goods if Poland could produce a car air conditioning unit for €500 and China with its lower cost labor force and more established industrial infrastructure could produce the same thing for €400 but it got hit with a € 150 import tax then even though China is more competitive an EU country like Germany would still choose to buy its components from Poland of course this is a very oversimplified example the exact trade taxes and restrictions in place for trading partners within the European Union is incredibly extensive and complicated but the basic Theory still stands now while this has being a great opportunity for Poland it's kind of Trapped it if it tried to trade globally it would easily be outc competed by cheaper Senators that it's currently protected from because of its EU membership its location is also great for trading within the European continent but it's surprisingly isolated from the world's oceans through the Baltic Sea now other European countries have been able to competitively trade with the rest of the world but for now at least Poland doesn't quite have the same cach a of Germany France or even Italy where Global consumers are willing to pay a premium for luxury cars or consumer goods because a handbag made in Poland doesn't quite elicit the same feelings of luxury as a handbag made in France Beyond being restricted by its guilded cage of captive trade partners that aren't growing much themselves Poland will also have to deal with the fact that as it and its people continue to grow wealthier they're going to become less competitive today after three decades of sustained economic growth Poland has a GDP per capita of $18,000 about 50% higher than the global average but still significantly lower than most other European centers especially those in the west but if this continues to grow at the rate it currently has been which hopefully it will then wages are going to continue to grow as well which they have been eventually Poland is going to lose its comparative advantage as a lowcost estimation for manufacturing to other Eastern European countries that are coming up behind it this is known as the middle- inome Trap where a country becomes too rich to be competitive with lowcost labor but not rich enough to develop its own ADV Advanced Industries this is something that we've explored many times on the channel before when we looked at economies like South Korea Japan Taiwan Vietnam Brazil and even China some countries can successfully make the jump and some really do struggle and end up going backwards the only difference in Poland's case is that it's falling into the middle inome trap within a market that itself is struggling to remain globally competitive and that's just the first of the country's major challenges most economists agree that membership in the EU was a positive step for Poland not only did it clearly demonstrate that it was a country had been led into a fairly exclusive Club it also gave it a captive Market to grow its economy off of but it didn't come without drawbacks the first was simply that because the EU reduced the barriers to workers finding a job in any member country to effectively zero Poland had a major problem with brain drain the smartest youngest and most productive workers now had the option to stay in Poland or they could alternatively go just across the border into Germany where they could earn on average twice as much for work in much the same industry a lot of well-educated young polish workers already learned German and English as as a second or third language so it was an easy step for a lot of them to take additionally a lot of the same companies that were operating in Poland to produce component manufacturing Parts also had operations in wealthier Western European countries so a lot of Polish workers could stay with their employer while getting a job that paid more remittances where workers moving money over the Border would send money back home to their families in Poland at the peak accounted for nearly 3% of total GDP which did help but it didn't make up for the Lost tax revenue and labor force since it was mostly young workers at the peak of of their career from the perspective of a heartless Economist with a singular focus on maximizing output this situation meant that Poland just had the leftovers of people that were less economically ambitious or older and on average required more Social Services while contributing less to the tax base this trend obviously slowed growth but as we explored earlier incomes are rising and now the difference between working in Germany and working in Poland is not as Extreme as it was even a decade ago as that creates the problem of the middle- income trap it's also solving the problem of brain drain provided that Poland can find work for all these people returning home the movement of young workers should be closely monitored but it's no longer the country's primary demographic concern outside of the countries directly involved in the conflict the invasion of Ukraine has perhaps most intensely been felt in Poland it has the same energy concerns as most other countries in Europe but on top of that given its Geographic position directly bordering the conflict Zone it's been used as a base of operations by forces supplying military and civilian Aid to Ukraine it's also been by far the most popular destination for over 1.6 million refugees fleeing the conflict given Poland's own extensive history been stuck between major powers in Europe and Russia the country is been accommodating but it's coming at a significant cost 1.6 million people entering a relatively small country within the span of 2 years is going to be an economic shock no matter what but a large share of these people are elderly or young children again speaking as an incredibly cold-hearted macroeconomist people that consume more resources than they produce tragic Ally of course there is currently no end in sight for the conflict and even when fighting does stop many commentators expect that people won't move back because of the relative safety better job opportunities and higher living standards offered by Poland some issues are more important than maximizing economic output and this is clearly one of them but it also has to be recognized that despite all of its success in recent decades Poland is still not a rich Advanced economy yet at least and a major shock like this has the potential to undo a lot of the progress the country has worked very hard for while it makes the difficult often perilous transition from a manufacturing center to an advanced service-based economy in addition to this huge demographic shift Poland has also made commitments towards massively expanding its military if it sticks to these plans it will have the largest military in Europe and be spending as much as 5% of its total economic output on a military that will hopefully never be needed that is a larger percentage than it was spending during the final years of the Soviet Union and more than double what it is at the moment National Defense is a crucial aspect of any country and it's understandable that Poland wants to take a proactive approach to looking after itself given its vulnerable location in the world but this is going to be a significant economic burden on top of a growing number of other economic burdens that Poland is going to need to manage to continue its growth and catch up with its European peers okay now it's time to put Poland one of Europe's fastest growing major economies on the economics explained National leaderboard starting as always with size Poland has a GDP of $688 billion making it the 21st largest economy in the world of Argentina and a fairway behind Switzerland even still this is a major economic Force so for now it gets an 8 out of 10 that output is spread out over a population of 37.7 million people as of 2020 as we explored in this video that population is significantly higher now due to an influx of refugees from Ukraine and as population increases all other things been equal GDP per capita will decrease but according to the most recently available statistics the country has a per capita output of 18,32 $1 which is in line with regional peers like Croatia and Hungary as the 52nd most productive country in the world on a per capita basis Poland gets a 6 out of 10 stability and confidence is an interesting one the country itself is shown that it can avoid problems with endemic corruption and economic mismanagement it's not perfect but it's by far in a way better than most former Soviet States the country has also been able to cultivate strong international relations and avoid higher levels of government debt something that will likely pay significant dividends with the economic challenges it's facing as a result of losing its cost competitive Regional advantage and the war in Ukraine economic problems like these are always going to be a challenge but a barely sustainable level of debt can quickly turn a challenge into a crisis and for now at least the debt rate in the country should be easily manageable especially since it also has easy access to the world's second most traded Global Currency the Euro balancing the good with the bad Poland gets a 7 out of 10 growth has been strong by Regional standards but that particular region is made up of countries that have been experiencing very slow and often even negative growth Poland's slow and steady approach has been a blessing in disguise though countries that can boast double- digit economic growth figures year after year are more often than not resorting to some very unsustainable practices to achieve that growth which can easily come at the expense of long-term economic success measured over decades in many ways Poland's roughly 5% annual growth rate is kind of The Sweet Spot for a rapidly developing economy but even still it's below the true outliers over the past decade so it gets an 8 out of 10 finally IND Poland has built a very strong manufacturing industry and today it's moving into more advanced value adding services like technology finance and Engineering for now it gets a 7 out of 10 because it's still growing and none of its Industries are World leading in any capacity but if it keeps developing like it has been that could change very quickly alt together that gives Poland an average score of 7.2 out of 10 which puts it up here on the leaderboard a very respectable position and one that will hopefully be even better when exploring this rapidly developing economy in a few years time we can Poland's relative economic success a lot to Russia's in the post-soviet era now we've already made an entire video on this one from Russia's perspective so we didn't want to repeat too much here but you should be able to click to that video on your screen now for the full story thanks for watching mate bye\",\n",
       " \"After the devastation it suffered in World\\nWar II, Poland was a struggling nation, and life didn’t get any easier when it became\\na satellite state of the Soviet Union. But Poland has been clawing back its status\\nas a major player in Europe, and some are saying it may even soon surpass the once mighty\\nGreat Britain as a major world power, both economically and militarily. That’s a big claim, so let’s examine Poland’s\\nrise to power and how it might just be turning into Europe's Next Superpower. If you went to Poland a few decades ago, around\\nthe time Coca-Cola was still regarded as something of a luxury item and a symbol of American\\ncapitalist imperialism, life might have looked a little grim. This was a country that had been torn apart\\nin the war, hit from two sides by the Germans and Soviets, and then faced decades of hardship\\nunder Communist rule. In historical terms, Poland has certainly\\nexperienced some extreme ups and downs. As the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the\\nearly 17th century, Poland was a force to be reckoned with, able to defend itself against\\nother powers and more than capable of its own aggressive actions against its neighbors. At its peak, the Commonwealth was home to\\n11 million people and had spread itself over one million square km, compared to(Poland\\ntoday which is 121,209 square miles (313930 square km). Much of Ukraine was under Polish rule for\\nmuch of this period, which Russia fought it for, but the Commonwealth was easily a match\\nfor Russia. In fact, in the Polish–Muscovite War of\\n1605 to 1618, the Poland–Lithuania Commonwealth made substantial territorial gains in the\\nregion on the European front, something Russia would never forget. This was the Polish Golden Age though, a renaissance\\nperiod for Poland. The country was a major political, military,\\nand economic power, and while it never quite reached the heights of other great European\\ngreat powers or colonized other nations, its prowess allowed its culture and language spread\\nfar and wide, a process known as Polonization. But then came the downfall, where Poland was,\\nin effect, erased as a nation. Bit by bit, the country was taken apart in\\nwhat we now call the partitions of Poland. These occurred piecemeal in 1772, 1793, and\\n1795. Russia, Prussia, and Austria together picked\\nPoland apart, and Poland wasn’t militarily strong enough to stop these huge territorial\\nseizures from happening, which had been weakened from its oligarchical rule. In just the first partition, Poland lost around\\nhalf of its population and about one-third or (81,500 square miles, 211,000 square km)\\nof its land. In the second, Russia and Prussia took another\\n115,000 square miles (300,000 square km), and after these two countries quelled a Polish\\nuprising in 1794, Poland lost another 83,000 square miles (215,000 square km). Austria grabbed part of what was then called\\nLittle Poland, an area Southeast of the country that contained the city of Kraków. This was not a great time in Polish history. For 123 years, there was no autonomous state\\nknown as Poland as an autonomous state, but then under Napoleon Bonaparte, the Duchy of\\nWarsaw was created in 1807 after the Poles fought alongside him. This was a client state of France but something\\nclose to Polish sovereignty. But then Napoleon later failed miserably in\\nhis invasion of Russia, after which European powers decided what to do with borders and\\nterritories in the meetings known as the Congress of Vienna from 1814 to 1815. That saw the end of the Duchy of Warsaw, making\\nit so Poland was once again firmly divided into parcels owned by Russia, Prussia, and\\nAustria. The Congress Kingdom of Poland was created,\\nbut it was under Russian rule. Then in 1830, there was the November Uprising,\\nin which the Russians eventually quelled a Polish rebellion, after which, in 1832, the\\nRussian Emperor Nicholas I issued the Organic Statute of the Kingdom of Poland. This was an attempt to erase any autonomy\\nthe Polish had in Russian-occupied Poland. Meanwhile, there was widespread persecution\\nof Poles, sometimes referred to as anti-Polonism, which would last for centuries not only among\\nthe three partition countries but, later, from the Germans and the Ukrainian nationalists. All this hardship has shaped how many Poles\\nfeel about their nation today, especially the more recent tough times Poland faced. The country only regained its independence\\nin 1918, but then just two decades later, it was invaded from two sides at the beginning\\nof the World War. After almost six million Poles died by in\\nthe war, and afterwards it became a client state of the Soviet Union. It’s thought Poland lost about 38% of its\\nnational resources and infrastructure in the war, and while the Germans were supposed to\\npay Poland back in reparations, that didn’t happen, or, at least, not as it should have. The Soviets ensured reparations came from\\nSoviet-controlled East Germany, so those reparations didn’t exactly look like a windfall. Poland not only went without these large reparations\\nfrom Germany, but it was also not part of the Marshall Plan, which was the US initiative\\nto help war-torn Western Europe. The Communist years were marked by almost\\nconstant crises, often resulting in protests when the low standard of living was too much\\nfor many Poles to take. There were numerous reforms, and there was\\nconstant repression, although many Poles saw the light at the end of the tunnel when in\\n1970, Edward Gierek became First Secretary of the ruling Polish United Workers' Party. He promised to improve people’s lives and\\npartly opened Poland up to the West while allowing much more freedom of speech and expression\\nthan those that had come before him. For many, Gierek’s era was the first time\\nthey owned luxury goods, such as a car or a TV. He oversaw the construction of the now famous\\nPolish town blocks. He built the first highway in the country,\\nwhile creating and strengthening other industries. He built steelworks and glassworks, and under\\nhim, the automobile factory that produced the famous Polski Fiat 126p was constructed. Poland was still poor, but life did improve\\nfor many, and Gierek’s relatively liberal attitude compared to the leaders that had\\npreceded him was like breathing fresh air after living in a stuffy smokehouse for decades. Alas, Gierek borrowed a lot of money from\\nthe West to fuel his plans, around $40 billion, which eventually brought an economic crisis\\nto Poland, and by the end of his tenure in 1981, sights such as people queuing around\\nthe block for many hours just to buy a roll of toilet paper were a\\nPeople weren’t just broke. Many didn’t even have food, and there was\\ntalk of uprisings. Poland’s GDP per capita in 1979 had been\\n$2,167, and in 1980, it was down to $1,595. Compare that to Britain where the GDP per\\ncapita was around $10,000. In the US, it was $12,000. France had similar numbers, while Spain’s\\nwas around $6,000, Portugal $3,300 and Italy $8,000. Poland was poor and it seemed like the country\\ncould never get a break, something that might partly be driving Poland’s rise to power\\nnow. Economic experts often talk about how GDP\\ndoesn’t always tell the full story of how well people live, and that’s correct, but\\nin 1981, Poland was indeed an economic tragedy. People struggled to buy the most basic necessities,\\nthe Police were highly corrupt, as were most other officials, and the regular working person\\ndidn’t have much hope. The Rzeczpospolita Daily newspaper wrote that\\nin the summer of 1981, Poland was at the “bottom of the crisis,” stating that Warsaw was\\nso poor that the buses couldn’t run because there wasn’t enough money to replace tires. As food was rationed and people could buy\\njust a few pounds of meat per month, citizens took to the streets flying banners that showed\\na black skull with a knife and fork crossed below. People shouted in unison, “We are tired\\nof being hungry!” “We are tired of queueing!” We demand life on the level of a civilized\\ncountry!” The New York Times wrote on July 30, 1981,\\nthat “ANGER OVER FOOD SPREADS IN POLAND” and that there was a “new wave of unrest”\\nas people called out that they were hungry; they wanted bread; they wanted meat. They said they’d had enough of lies and\\nthreatened that “the Hungry Will Eat the Authorities.” The government responded by implementing martial\\nlaw, blaming the food shortages on strikes. While not the response the protestors were\\nlooking for, in some ways, this was a slight improvement, since in the decades earlier,\\nbeing part of a protest might have meant torture and a bullet in the back. So, this was Poland in 1981, a year before\\nmuch of the world watched “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” and saw how young\\nAmerican kids living among pretty tree-lined streets didn’t seem to have much more to\\nworry about than their next bicycle adventure through their beautiful suburbs. And in those kinds of films, when someone\\nopened the refrigerator door, inside was more food than you could dream of. Poland was another world completely. Polish people wanted that reality… and now,\\nmany of them have it. If you visit Poland today,, while there is\\nstill poverty, of course, the days of food shortages seem to Poles like another world. There is a collective breath of fresh air\\nbeing breathed in, and this one is no flash in the pan like in the late 70s when the government\\ngot so reckless with borrowing. The present seems like a new Golden Age to\\nthose that suffered through wars and Communism. Meanwhile, news media in the UK is saying\\nPoland will soon overtake the UK as a major European power. This is huge if it’s true. We are talking about a country that had the\\nbiggest empire the world has ever seen being overtaken by a country that couldn’t even\\nfeed its citizens just a few decades prior. And the UK’s decline and Poland's rise serve\\nas an comparison for each other, and show just how far Poland has come. As many Poles are now enjoying this relatively\\ngood patch in their history, meanwhile in the UK between 1 April 2022 and 31 March 2023,\\na leading UK charity said it distributed three million emergency food parcels, an increase\\nof 37% from the same period the year before. In what’s called the Cost-of-Living Crisis,\\ndemand for food banks hit an all-time high in the UK. Sure, Poland has food banks too, but the difference\\nis that most people that use them, according to the European Food Banks Association, are\\nrefugees. In the UK, it’s the general populace that\\nis now unable to feed themselves, sometimes even with a full-time job. Hundreds of thousands of Poles emigrated to\\nthe UK over the last 20 years, but now the British media is saying they’re returning\\nto their homeland in droves, a homeland now being called “the land of opportunity.” The Sunday Times said the standard of living\\nin Poland is improving, while British standards are declining. The cost of living in the UK is increasing,\\nas is the crime rate, as are waiting lines at hospitals. Is this an exaggeration? A recent article we found titled “Travelling\\nAcross Poland Showed Me That Britain’s Economy Is Broken” described ugly and forlorn-looking\\nformer industrial towns in Britain full of betting shops, pawn shops, and discount supermarkets. In larger cities, he found people sleeping\\nin doorways everywhere. He wrote, “OECD, using GDP per capita, at\\npurchasing power parity, cities like Warsaw, Poznan, Krakow, and Wroclaw are all wealthier\\nthan Liverpool, Birmingham, and Manchester.” He said he found the difference in how much\\nbetter life was in Polish cities “immediately obvious.” What happened to the seemingly unsinkable\\nship of Great Britain, and how did Poland manage to become so much stronger than it\\nhad been in the past? Poland initiated major economic reform in\\n1989 when it transitioned to a capitalist market economy. Small and medium state-owned companies were\\nprivatized, and the private business sector flourished, as Poland was viewed by its neighbors\\nas business-friendly. It began to receive a lot of Foreign Direct\\nInvestment, or FDI, since it soon had a highly-skilled workforce and was cheaper than much of Western\\nEurope as a place to do business. The country soon became one of the world’s\\nso-called economic miracles. It was the growth champion of Europe, experiencing\\nbetter growth than even those Asian tiger economies such as Taiwan, Singapore, and South\\nKorea. Also, Poland managed to largely avoid recession\\nin the global economic crisis of 2008 and 2009. As the GDP for the European Union as a whole\\ndecreased by 4.5%, the Polish GDP actually increased by 1.6% when the crisis was at its\\nworst. One of the worst countries hit was Great Britain,\\nwhich had for years banked on its, well, banking industry. It eventually became the G7’s worst-ranked\\nnation for business investment - quite the opposite of Poland, which focused on building\\nbrainpower and business development. This was a country that in 1990 had a GDP\\nper capita of a paltry $1,731, which was minuscule when you consider Britain’s was about $19,000,\\nFrance’s at the time was about $21,000, and the US's about $23,000. Spain’s was around $13,000 and Portugal's\\nwas $7,000. Poland was still poor, but it was about to\\nchange those glaring GDP shortfalls. When Poland joined the European Union in May\\n2004, its economy was subsequently turbo-charged, and this wasn’t a result of flogging all\\nits natural resources or some kind of banking magic. The reason, as many economists have pointed\\nout, is Poland’s diversified economy and, more importantly, the brainpower of the public,\\nwhich has embraced entrepreneurship. The government promoted competition while\\nputting much emphasis on higher education. In 1989, only about one in ten young Poles\\nstudied at the university level. Now it’s one in two, higher than the EU\\naverage. In a study published by the Program for International\\nStudent Assessment (PISA), it revealed that Poland was one of the leading countries in\\nthe world regarding educational standard improvements. Poland’s PISA score for reading, math, and\\nscience was one of the highest in the world at 12th place, behind countries such as China,\\nSingapore, Korea, Japan, Switzerland the Netherlands. The UK was down in 26th place, but it was,\\nat least, above Italy, Spain, and the US. PISA said Polish 15-year-olds are more functionally\\nliterate than most of the kids in the EU and North America. The country has also become an IT hub. The European Commission recently made a list\\nof the strongest tech innovators in Europe, and Poland was placed in the Emerging Innovator\\nbracket. The UK didn’t even make the list. We’re not trying to pick on the UK here. It’s just the press has been talking a lot\\nabout how Poland will overtake the UK as a power, so we’ve chosen the UK as a comparison\\nin which to judge Poland’s ascension as a power. Poland is now said to be a leader in the Central\\nand Eastern European region for greenfield investments, which are investments where a\\ncompany starts a new venture by constructing new facilities from the ground up, rather\\nthan purchasing or leasing existing ones. Ranking as the third-best in Europe, its location\\nbetween East and West Europe hasn’t always worked out well for Poland, but now with its\\nmuch-improved transportation infrastructure, it’s in the perfect place to bridge developed\\neconomies in Central and Eastern Europe. 94% of investors are reported to be willing\\nto re-invest in Poland, in part because it offers smart investment incentives, and according\\nto Statistica, it’s the most attractive country in the region in which to invest. It’s always a good sign for an economy when\\nforeign countries want to invest there. The Swedish battery manufacturer Northvolt\\njust opened Europe’s largest factory for energy storage systems in Poland. In 2023, Microsoft said it was impressed with\\nPoland’s IT scene and opened its first data center there, calling Poland the “newest\\ntrusted cloud region” and the data center “the first in Central and Eastern Europe”\\nfor Microsoft. Google has also opened a data hub in what\\nit says is Poland’s thriving IT industry. Poland is excelling in the area of aerospace,\\nwhich is evident when you look at its so-called Aviation Valley in the southeast of the country. 115 companies are working here, which employ\\n23,000 technicians, engineers, and designers. Other large industries in Poland are agriculture,\\nautomotive, energy, defense, manufacturing, and tourism. Speaking of the latter, besides many cities\\nwith outstanding architecture, Poland also has vast wilderness to be explored. It is home to Central-Eastern Europe’s largest\\nnumber of areas on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Poland has been one of the best performers\\nin terms of European tourism booms over the last decade. Poland is also described as a good place to\\nlive in general. It now often makes it onto lists of best places\\nto live in Europe, with people saying you get good bang for your buck in Poland. If you look at various lists of countries\\nin Europe where expats and digital nomads are drawn to for low prices but high standards,\\nPoland generally is featured on those lists, which means drawing talent from the global\\ntalent pool. Still, Poles earn less than Brits, on average. The UK, in 2023, had a per capita GDP of about\\n$46,000, and Poland’s wasn’t even half of that at about $19,000. France’s was $44,000, Italy’s $36,000,\\nand Portugal was at $26,000. Poland is still behind, but nothing like it\\nwas in the recent past when its GDP wasn’t even a tenth of the UK’s, and if trends\\nare anything to go by, it will overtake the UK soon enough. We should add again though, that you can’t\\nlook solely at GDP and know what life is like for people in a nation. Ireland has a massive per capita GDP, double\\nthat of the UK, but only because huge multinational companies have operations there. A recent survey showed seven out of ten young\\nIrish people wanted to move out of Ireland because they believed they’d find a better\\nstandard of living elsewhere. Wealth isn’t spread out equally, which is\\nwhy you have much of the UK currently relying on food banks, and millions of homeowners\\nare finding themselves priced out of life after what AP in 2023 said were “skyrocketing\\nenergy and food costs stemming from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.” GDP per capita doesn’t always mean a lot. People are saying life in Poland right now\\nis better for your average Joe, or should we say Józef, than it is in Britain, despite\\nthe GDP difference. This is a country on the rise. To understand the standard of living, it’s\\nbetter to look at what you get for your money, what safety nets are provided for you, how\\nwell-educated you are, and what chance you have of flourishing in the workplace. You can also look at forums to get perspectives\\nfrom average citizens. We did just that, and one man said, “I’m\\n31, I’m born and bred in the UK, and I’ve recently moved to Poland. The first thing you notice is that you get\\na lot more for your money in Poland.” He talked about how safe he felt; how inspiring\\nit was to see how proud people are to be Polish. He added, “Poland will afford you a much\\nbetter quality of life with plenty of surplus to spare.” Another poster said when comparing the two\\nnations, that in Poland you had “Safety, better food, better quality and better-educated\\npeople, intelligent and beautiful women, great amazing and rich culture, better social and\\ninter-human styles, more polite and educated society on the main.” One more person wrote in Poland he found,\\n“Low cost of living vs a fantastically high standard of living. Great education, ok to decent food, great\\ntravel locations, friendly people, lovely weather.” We don’t want to idealize Poland, and of\\ncourse these forums are to some extent self-selecting, but we found literally zero people who’d\\nlived in both countries that didn’t prefer Poland. This hope and pride the first person talked\\nabout, which is partly related to that tough time we explained that Poles have had, count\\nfor a lot when we are considering Poland’s present and future development. The British are suffering a confidence crisis,\\na national disillusionment, and many people have lost hope in governance. A recent survey revealed 73% of those living\\nin the UK said they didn’t trust the government to help improve their lives, whether on the\\nright side or the left side. 56% of Poles said they distrusted their own\\ngovernment, but 55% said they trusted the EU. The economic analyst Matt Klein recently explained\\nthat things in the UK are worse than GDP per capita makes it seem. He said, “Take out Greater London — the\\nprosperity of which depends to an uncomfortable degree on a willingness to provide services\\nto oligarchs from the Middle East and the former Soviet Union — and the UK is one\\nof the poorest countries in Western Europe.” The same article explained that the U.K. has\\nbecome a “dark triad of deindustrialization, degrowth, and denigration of foreigners.” Considering per capita growth and productivity\\ngrowth per person, the UK is actually the worst in the G7 with its yearly decreases,\\nbut Poland’s per capita growth has been increasing every year. It doesn’t mean as Poland becomes a more\\nmature economy, it will stay this way, but right now, the arrows are all facing upwards. The average growth in Poland is 3.6%, while\\nin the UK, it has hovered around 0.5%. If this trend continues, Poland will indeed\\nsurpass the UK, while Hungary and Romania will do the same by 2040. Unlike Poland, the 2008 financial crisis hit\\nBritain, a finance hub, hard. The government decided to pursue a policy\\nof austerity, fearing debt while not focusing on productivity. Foreign exports declined, as did foreign investment,\\nwhile wages couldn’t keep up with inflation. Productivity hasn’t been this low in Britain\\nsince the 18th century, and according to most experts, there are no signs of recovery at\\nthe moment. Much of the recent concern in Britain came\\nwhen Labor leader Sir Keir Starmer said, “The British people are falling behind while our\\nEuropean neighbors get richer, in the east as well as in countries like France and Germany. I'm not comfortable with that; not comfortable\\nwith a trajectory that will soon see Britain overtaken by Poland.” He would say that, as he wants to blame the\\npeople he wants to replace, but he has a point. With a large economy, a large military usually\\nfollows, which can help to seal your standing as a great power, and Poland is no exception\\nto this. Yhe Polish government said in 2023 that it\\nwould raise defense spending from 2.4 percent of its gross domestic product to 5 percent. The Polish Defense Minister Mariusz Błaszczak\\nsaid Poland is working toward having “the most powerful land forces in Europe.” Poland already has more tanks and howitzers\\nthan its neighbor, Germany, and the country says it will have 300,000 troops by 2035,\\ncompared with Germany’s current 184,000 and the UK’s 231,000. Poland presently has about 152,000 military\\npersonnel. Meanwhile, according to the website Global\\nFirepower, while the UK has the fifth most powerful military in the world, how long can\\nit keep investing in its military if its poorest people can no longer afford to live in their\\nhouses and buy their groceries? These people may not take kindly to being\\ntold their military is expanding as they starve. That’s no exaggeration. Reports in 2023 said nearly one in five low-income\\nfamilies experience food insecurity. Ten million British adults and four million\\nchildren engage in daily intermittent fasting, not because they heard it advertised on a\\npodcast, but because they can’t afford to eat. Just recently, Poland inked a deal with South\\nKorea to buy $13.7 billion worth of military equipment, including 80 K2 Black Panther tanks,\\n200 K9 Thunder howitzers, 48 FA-50 light attack aircraft, and 218 K239 Chunmoo rocket launchers. Poland also recently bought 250 Abrams tanks\\nfrom the U.S. and 32 F-35 fighters, all costing around $10 billion. The US also sold $4.75 billion worth of Patriot\\nmissiles to Poland, adding to an approved anti-missile defense system. Poland also purchased 18 advanced combat High\\nMobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, for $414 million. For the future, the two nations have agreed\\nto a $10 billion deal which will include 500 HIMMARS, 468 launcher-loader module kits,\\n45 M57 Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, and hundreds of guided multiple launch rockets\\nand warheads. The US said this “will improve Poland’s\\nmilitary goals of updating capability while further enhancing interoperability with the\\nUnited States and other allies.” With Russia next to Poland, the US is more\\nthan happy to support Poland's aspirations of becoming the next big European power. Poland’s huge rearmament programs, including\\na $2.4 billion contract for British CAMMs air defense missiles in 2023, tell us Poland\\nmeans business. The country’s defense budget has increased\\nto $30 billion, which at 4.25% of Poland’s GDP, is the highest proportion of GDP in all\\nNATO nations. Poland is looking to be the kind of military\\npower it was back in its Golden Age. A military pundit said that “No Western\\ncountry wants to scale up its military so much and so fast.” The former NATO spokesman Jamie Shea agreed\\nwith that, saying, “Poland will become the strongest military power on land in central\\nand Eastern Europe.” If that’s true, with a strong military and\\na leading GDP, Poland will indeed become a regional great power. The US will also help Poland with its new\\nnuclear energy plan, which will help Poland to start making more of its own weapons. Another pundit said Poland “looks set to\\nbecome Europe’s industrial as well as military powerhouse.” Let’s face it, Poland knows it must protect\\nitself, given what’s happened in the past. As it becomes wealthier and its people become\\nbetter off, they might not mind such hefty military spending. Considering Poland’s recent past, this is\\nquite an economic miracle. The question is, will it last? Even with all of Poland’s successes, many\\nPoles don’t trust what is reported to be their right-wing nationalist government. Just recently, hundreds of thousands of people\\nmarched in the capital Warsaw saying their government has violated the constitution and\\nis eroding people’s fundamental democratic rights. These people like the EU, but they don’t\\nlike the government, which they fear will turn into another autocracy. Even so, Polish people are flocking back to\\ntheir homeland. A reverse-brain drain is taking place, which\\nhas seen them leaving the UK and other countries and returning to Poland, where they say there\\nis more hope for them. They’ve heard the news about the booming\\ntech industry and the fact that the World Trade Organization said in 2022 that Poland\\nbeat countries such as China, India, and Brazil for growth in online services. The prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said\\nnot long ago, “Polish people are starting to realize that there are exciting opportunities\\nwaiting for them back home.” In January 2022, Poland’s Finance Ministry\\ncreated the “Polish Deal,” which lured people back by allowing them to pay zero income\\ntax for the first four years after they’ve resettled. Poland is even attracting US software engineers. One of them said in 2023, “People in Poland\\nhave more hobbies outside of work, whereas in the US, work is your life. People like to spend time with their family\\nmore in Poland.” She said salaries in Poland are now catching\\nup to salaries in the US. Some British firms have now started setting\\nup operations in the EU since after Brexit; they say there are higher costs and numerous\\nnew trading rules. It might seem ironic that some British companies\\nare setting up shop in Poland. A writer for an economy-focused website wrote\\nin 2023, “Poland is actively courting British firms.” But will things stay this way? Will Britain bounce back? Will the Phoenix of Poland proceed to the\\nheights of a European superpower? In a decade or so, could Polish people be\\ncomplaining about all the British immigrants trying to enter their country and take their\\njobs? We can’t say for certain this will happen,\\nbut as things stand, it’s not out of the realm of possibility. Now you need to see how the other half live\\nin Britain in “How the British Royals Actually Make Money.” Or, have a look at “How England Managed\\nTo Invade 90% Of The World.”\",\n",
       " 'Poland is becoming an intimidating military\\nforce in Europe and it’s making Putin sweat. A lot. And with good reason. Here’s the situation. The balance of power in Eastern Europe is\\nchanging rapidly. Russia, the traditional leader in the region,\\nis in decline. Poland, on the other hand, is rapidly gaining\\nstrength. In 2023, it is at its strongest standing in\\nthe European balance of power since the days of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the\\n17th century, and it is currently engaged in a large military buildup that would see\\nit create the strongest fighting force on the Continent. For Russia, this poses even more problems\\nthan those it has already dealt with in its weakening geopolitical standing. A strong Poland all but guarantees to put\\na hard limit on Russia’s geopolitical ambitions in Eastern Europe and the Baltic Sea. Might we be seeing the beginnings of a purported\\nThucydides Trap scenario in Eastern Europe, where a rising Poland causes fear in the Russian\\nleadership about potentially being displaced as the ruling power in the region? If war did break out, would the Russian military\\nbe able to conquer Poland on its own? Let’s take a look at the balance of power\\nin Eastern Europe and the Baltic and how well Russia would do against a much-better armed\\nPoland. Poland and Russia have a long history of warfare,\\nwith each prevailing over the other on numerous occasions. After the end of the Cold War and the fall\\nof the Soviet Union, Poland went on a spree of breakneck economic growth and joined NATO\\nin 1999. Starting in 2014, Poland began a big military\\nbuildup. The country had previously been under the\\nNATO guidance of spending 2% of GDP on defense, but in 2022, it spent 2.6% on its military,\\nby NATO estimates. It is increasing its defense spending, too. In 2023, it structured its national budget\\nto spend 4% of GDP on its military, making it one of the biggest defense spenders in\\nNATO per capita. Poland can afford this. It has been Europe’s biggest economic success\\nstory of the 21st century, with an average annual GDP growth rate of almost 4% since\\nthe end of the Cold War in 1991. In a generation, Poland has gone from an impoverished\\ncommunist vassal state to a budding great power. That Poland would increase its defense spending\\nand military ambitions since 2014 is no coincidence. That was the year when Russia intervened in\\nthe Ukrainian Maidan unrest, illegally annexed Crimea, and carved separatist territories\\naway from Kyiv’s control in the Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts. The Poles, who have a long historical memory,\\nunderstood what Russia was up to and prepared for a potential confrontation. As a result, the Polish military now is far\\nmore capable than it was even a few years ago. In the recent past, Poland had been using\\nSoviet-era equipment that the Russian military also uses and is accustomed to dealing with. Such equipment includes tanks like the T-72\\nmain battle tank and the fourth-generation MiG-29 fighter jet. However, Poland is now slowly but steadily\\ngetting rid of this equipment, often through donations to the Ukrainian military. It is instead acquiring and training its soldiers\\nto use modern equipment, especially from the United States and South Korea. The new equipment includes an initial order\\nof 32 fifth-generation F-35 Lightning II fighter jets, to be delivered between now and 2030. Poland has also ordered 48 South Korean FA-50\\nlight combat aircraft, which can operate in air-to-air or air-to-ground scenarios and\\nis ideal for helping transition Polish pilots to the F-35. For closer air support, Poland has purchased\\n96 American AH-64E Apache attack helicopters. Meanwhile, to defend its skies, Poland is\\npurchasing $5 billion worth of American Patriot air defense missiles and $2.4 billion worth\\nof British CAMM air defense missiles. Poland’s investment in creating a modern\\nair force and air defense system would pose the first big problem for Russia in any renewed\\nRusso-Polish hostilities. Russia has been unable to establish air superiority\\nin Ukraine, and Ukraine had a much less-capable air force and air defense network than the\\nones Poland is now acquiring. Military experts expect that Russia will have\\nabout two dozen of its newest fighter jet, the fifth-generation Su-57 Felon, in service\\nby the start of 2024. In 2019, Putin announced plans to have a fleet\\nof 76 of these planes in the Russian Air Force’s fleet by 2028. However, international sanctions placed on\\nRussia for its invasion of Ukraine threaten those plans because it is now far more difficult\\nfor the Russians to acquire the high-tech components needed for their construction. The existing Su-57s have seen service in Ukraine,\\nbut British intelligence reported that such service has been limited because Russian officers\\nfear losing these planes in operations. For an operation against Poland, the Su-57\\nwould come in direct combat with the F-35, in the first-ever encounter between two fifth-generation\\nfighter jets. The Su-57 is faster, with a top speed of about\\n1,500 mph compared to the F-35’s 1,200. It also has a longer range, with a combat\\nradius of 930 miles compared to the F-35’s 590. The Su-57 is designed to be more maneuverable\\nthan the F-35, thanks to its forward-swept wing design. However, the F-35 is harder to detect by radar. The biggest advantage that Polish pilots would\\nhave over the Su-57 is in the number of planes that they have. Because of sanctions, development of additional\\nSu-57s for Russia may prove impossible, while Poland can continue to expect more F-35s in\\nits air fleet. The longer Russia waits, the more its disparity\\nis likely to grow. The Russian air fleet is much bigger than\\nPoland’s as a whole, with 4,036 aircraft between its army and navy as of 2023. In comparison, the Polish Air Force has only\\n275 planes in service. In an all-out assault, Russia should theoretically\\nbe able to overwhelm the Poles through numbers, but the fact that it could not do this in\\nUkraine raises questions about whether the Russians would be able to establish air superiority\\nagainst a more capable air force, and with time, the number and ability of Poland’s\\naircraft will grow in comparison to Russia. The same principle also applies on land. Poland is in the process of creating a vast\\narmy. It has plans to nearly double the size of\\nits army to 300,000 active duty personnel by 2030, which would make it the largest fighting\\nforce in Europe. The Polish public supports this move. Enlistments in the Polish military have spiked\\nsince Russia invaded Ukraine. As of 2023, the Polish army has about 189,000\\ntotal personnel. The Russian army is much bigger, with 3.6\\nmillion total personnel. Whether now or in 2030, the Poles would be\\nsignificantly outnumbered in a Russian invasion. Experts believe that between 100,000 and 200,000\\nRussian troops are stationed in the Baltic enclave of Kaliningrad, which is also home\\nto Russia’s Baltic Fleet and hosts nuclear weapons. The presence of Kaliningrad poses serious\\ngeostrategic problems for Poland. The heavily-fortified enclave is only 240\\nmiles north of Warsaw. Kaliningrad also sits a mere 40 miles away\\nfrom Belarus’ western border. This stretch of territory is called the “Suwalki\\nGap,” and military experts consider it the most vulnerable position in NATO’s territory. A Russian offensive westward from Belarus\\nand eastward from Kaliningrad across the Suwalki Gap would, if successful, cut Poland off from\\nits NATO allies Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. While those three Baltic States would suffer\\nthe worst for it, a successful operation across the Suwalki Gap would deprive Poland of some\\nsupplies and military options. Meanwhile, a drive southward from Kaliningrad\\ntoward Warsaw would force Poland into a defensive operation to protect its capital. Numerically superior Russian forces would\\nalso be far more heavily concentrated in a Polish campaign than they had been in Ukraine,\\nwith its much vaster territory. The dispersal of Russian forces across such\\na large area was one of the reasons why the Russian advance at the start of the war did\\nnot come as rapidly as outside observers originally predicted. Poland, with its more compact size, would\\nnot have the same luxury. Most of the fighting would take place along\\nthe narrower axis between Kaliningrad and the Belarussian border. Belarus’ cooperation would be needed in\\nthese operations, but for all intents and purposes, it is a Russian vassal buffer state,\\nand leaked Russian documents from early 2023 suggest that Moscow aims to annex Belarus\\nby 2030. While Belarus did not intervene directly in\\nthe war in Ukraine, it hosted the troops that attacked Kyiv, and it currently hosts over\\n9,000 Russian troops, with plans to build even bigger bases. Belarus would be forced to host Russian troops\\nfor an invasion of Poland if the Kremlin really wanted to undertake the operation. Poland therefore has significant geographical\\nvulnerabilities that would aid the attack from Russian forces which outnumber them. Theoretically, this should mean that Russia\\ncan take very heavy casualties in a drive on Warsaw from north and east and still win. One Ukrainian soldier fighting against the\\nRussians in Donbas in March 2023 said the following:\\n“The Russian mobilizational reserve is pretty much infinite, which means that they have\\nthe luxury to make mistakes. They can lose a brigade or they can lose a\\nplatoon, and some of those people are going to survive and they can share experience with\\nthe new conscripts.” If Russia were to bring its full national\\nmight into the war effort, with different waves of mobilization, the Poles’ numerical\\ndisadvantage would become more pronounced. Poland’s population according to its 2022\\ncensus is about 38 million. Russia’s is about 147 million. However, as we have seen in Ukraine, the total\\nnumber of personnel in the military does not equally translate to combat power on the battlefield. Russia’s logistics problems were apparent\\nfrom the earliest days of the war in Ukraine, when it was operating on the border of its\\nown territory. Russian logistics for a war against Poland\\nwould be even more stretched. The supply lines would be longer, as they\\nwould need to go from the vast Russian interior, concentrate in Belarus, and then make their\\nway into Poland. Waterborne supply lines from St. Petersburg\\nto Kaliningrad would be shorter, but the balance of power in the Baltic currently greatly disfavors\\nRussia. The Baltic for all practical purposes has\\nbecome a NATO lake, especially with Finland’s entry into the alliance and Sweden’s entry\\npending. These maritime supply lines would be quickly\\ndisrupted in the event of a Russian war with Poland, even in the extremely unlikely scenario\\nthat NATO does not honor Article V commitments. Russian forces operating from Kaliningrad\\nwould therefore be difficult to supply unless the Russian offensive can create a land bridge\\nfrom there to Belarus. Such a scenario would give Poland the opportunity\\nto concentrate vital resources to prevent the Russians from achieving their objective. Destroying Russian supply lines and command\\nand control centers would slow the advance down and give Poland more time to mobilize\\nand counterattack. Fortunately for Poland, there are weapons\\non hand which would help it in this strategy. Undoubtedly, military officials in Warsaw\\nhad it in mind when embarking on their arms buildup. As of March 2023, Poland has purchased 18\\nHIMARS rocket artillery systems from the United States. Poland plans to increase the number of HIMARS\\nin its arsenal to 500 units. Ukraine has used HIMARS to devastating effect\\nagainst Russian forces. HIMARS is a highly precise delivery system,\\nand attacks on key assets like ammunition and fuel depots, command and control stations,\\nand other supply routes crippled Russian positions and allowed the Ukrainians to retake vast\\nswathes of territory in the late summer and autumn of 2022. HIMARS can come with a magazine of six MLRS\\nrockets, most notably the M31 GMLRS unitary, which can hit targets up to 70 kilometers\\naway. Poland’s HIMARS, however, will be even more\\ncapable, because the Poles have made an initial order of 45 ATACMS missiles. These munitions have a range of 300 kilometers\\nand would offer the Poles excellent options in striking critical Russian targets. Presumably, staging points in Kaliningrad\\nand Belarus would be a high priority for Poland’s HIMARS systems and ATACMS missiles, especially\\nsince the enclave would be difficult to resupply by sea. ATACMS can reach that far and Poland would\\nnot hesitate to use its missiles in this way. The damage Ukraine did to Russia with only\\na few dozen HIMARS systems and without ATACMS missiles would pale in comparison with what\\nthe Poles could do with many more such systems and the longer range ammunition. Poorly-organized and supplied Russian forces,\\nwhich would need to operate further from their own territory to begin with, would prove ripe\\ntargets for a hail of HIMARS fire, and HIMARS is not the only modern rocket artillery system\\nthat Poland is getting its hands on. To supplement HIMARS, Poland is purchasing\\nSouth Korean K293 Chunmoo MLRS platforms. The first batch of 18 of these arrived in\\nPoland in 2023, and the Poles plans to increase the size of the force to 288. The Chunmoo, which was designed to counter\\nlong-range North Korean artillery, can fire several types of unguided rockets with ranges\\nbetween 30 and 45 kilometers, guided rockets that can hit targets 80 kilometers away, and\\na ballistic missile capable of strikes up to 290 kilometers. The Chunmoo launchers would put further pressure\\non Russian supply lines and communications. In Ukraine, the Russians have adapted to HIMARS\\nby placing their critical assets further behind the front lines. They would try to do this in a Polish campaign,\\ntoo, but Poland will have longer range weapons between ATACMS and the Chunmoo-launched missiles. Additionally, Russian supply lines will be\\nlonger, with less room for dispersal of critical assets because of the more compact front that\\nwould come from a military confrontation between Poland and Russia. This is where Russia’s numbers might wind\\nup working against it, as more troops would be concentrated and vulnerable to rocket and\\nmissile attacks. The Russians have also shown poor signals\\nsecurity in Ukraine, which led to many HIMARS attacks on important targets. The Russian military has a poor command structure\\nand doctrine, with centralized control that discourages initiative in junior officers\\nand aggregates decision-making to commanders further from the front. MLRS attacks on supply lines and communications\\nhubs would therefore slow the Russian advance into Poland considerably, with confused masses\\nof Russian officers being unsure about how to act when not in communication with their\\nsuperiors. In contrast, Poland’s command structure\\nshould be far more nimble and adaptive thanks to superior NATO doctrine, and better protected\\nagainst the problems that come from a top-heavy organizational structure. Heavy rocket and missile attacks against Russian\\nforces trying to establish a land bridge from Belarus to Kaliningrad would probably prove\\neffective in slowing the Russian advance, raising Polish morale, and causing chaos in\\nthe Russian command. Poland is also investing heavily in modern\\ntanks to further bolster its ground fighting capability. 250 M1A2 Abrams, 116 M1A1 Abrams, and 1,000\\nSouth Korean K2 main battle tanks are on the way, while the Poles are slowly but surely\\nshedding their stockpile of older Soviet-era tanks like the T-72. The Poles are often donating this equipment\\nto the Ukrainians. Meanwhile, Poland’s current arsenal also\\nhas more than 240 Leopard tanks which would find themselves comfortable among the modern\\nAmerican and South Korean tanks set to arrive. Poland also plans on having a fleet of 1,000\\nof its native Borsuk infantry fighting vehicles, which are being designed to work alongside\\nthe incoming K2 tanks. In total, the Poles’ armored forces will\\ndwarf anything else in Europe. For a country that has long prided itself\\non its armored forces, the Russian tank units have done poorly in Ukraine. Almost 2,000 tanks have been destroyed or\\nabandoned there. Russia has also been hesitant to deployed\\nits supposed latest and greatest tank, the T-14 Armata, in Ukraine. In early September 2023, it withdrew the few\\nArmatas there, after supposed successful tests. The Russians might not have any choice but\\nto be less hesitant with the Armata in a hostile encounter with Poland. Unfortunately for Russia, there are only a\\nsmall number of Armatas in service – a test batch of about 40 was available in 2021, far\\nshort of the 2,300 the Kremlin said it would have by now. Such claims were made a decade ago. Even if the tanks are as good as the Russians\\nsay – and there is good reason to believe they are not – there are too few Armatas\\nto affect the course of a conflict, and with Western sanctions in place for the long haul,\\nit is unlikely that Russia would be able to build enough of the tanks to give it an advantage\\nover the modern tanks Poland is acquiring. The Russian tank force still dwarfs the size\\nof Poland’s in sheer numbers. Russia fields significantly more tanks than\\nany other country – up to about 12,600. However, only about 2,600 of those are main\\nbattle tanks, and only about a quarter of those 2,600 are the T-72B3/B3M, T-80BVM, and\\nT-90A/M tanks that have modern fire control and sighting systems. Additionally, those are 2021 figures. Russia has lost many of its best armored assets\\nin Ukraine since then. These tanks will be difficult for Russia to\\nreplace thanks to sanctions. Russia can break its archaic tanks out of\\nstorage, as it has been doing in Ukraine, but these would be cannon fodder for armored\\nwave attacks to overwhelm the Poles through sheer numbers. On a narrow front, those numbers matter, even\\nthough the Russians would take terrible casualties. Russia’s ace in the hole may be its preponderance\\nin artillery. The Russian army has always traditionally\\nbeen an artillery-centered fighting force. The Russian artillery corps has about 6,000\\ngun and rocket systems as of 2023. Poland is modernizing its gun systems with\\nplans to purchase 600 South Korean K9A1 self-propelled howitzers that can hit targets 34 miles away. Russia would have more artillery than Poland\\nin any scenario, but despite what they report about their artillery having one of the world’s\\nbest fire-control systems, Russian gunners are often poorly-trained, inaccurate, and\\nfollowing bad doctrine. The result is many wasted shots. This is why despite their firepower advantage,\\nthe Russians have suffered many reverses in Ukraine and have been unable to translate\\ntheir artillery superiority into decisive victories. There is no reason to believe it would be\\ndifferent in Poland. The narrower front might mean greater luck\\nfor Russian artillery, but Polish gunners would almost certainly be more accurate shot\\nfor shot than their Russian opponents. In any war on Polish territory, Russia would\\nhave numerical superiority in the air and on land. With enough dedication, the Russians could\\ntry to overwhelm the Poles with its sheer mass of personnel and firepower, but this\\nwould be a costly strategy, reminiscent of the Winter War of 1939-1940, where the Red\\nArmy’s wave attacks resulted in it suffering as many as ten times the amount of casualties\\nFinland took. The rapid modernization of Poland’s military,\\nRussia’s long supply lines and logistics problems, and poor doctrine and command structure,\\nmean that something similar could happen in a renewed Russo-Polish War. This would be the most probable scenario. Russia may win if it puts its full effort\\nbehind the invasion, but its ability to project further power would become crippled in the\\nprocess. Or perhaps Russia’s logistics and command\\nwould be so weak and Poland’s forces so much more effective that Russia gets stopped\\nin its tracks as it did around Kyiv, when its supply lines were inadequate even though\\nthe distances involved were much shorter than would be the case in a Polish campaign. But what do you think? What would a war between Russia and Poland\\nlook like? Let us know in the comments.

       " \"This number, 226, is the percentage increase\\nin the size of Poland's economy GDP per capita since the fall of Communism in 1990. In the last 30 years, Poland's economy has\\ngrown more than tenfold,  which is genuinely meteoric. This makes it the most successful economy\\nin Europe during that time,  recording an average growth rate of 4% in Europe. Poland is located between two rival superpowers,\\nGermany and Russia,  and it has had a challenging past. Just in the briefest of terms, Poland was\\nwiped off the map in the 18th century, and it was invaded from both directions, Germany\\nand Russia, in the 20th century. So, how has that longer-term history shaped\\nits present-day political and economic identity? Poland's rich history is a captivating journey\\nthrough time. It all began around 2000 B.C., with the emergence\\nof Poland's first civilization. However, the turning point came in A.D. 966\\nwhen the region's disparate tribes were united under the Slavic chief Mieszko, the first\\nruler of Poland and the founder of the first independent Polish state. Fast forward to the late 1500s, Poland and\\nLithuania joined together and formed a large, powerful commonwealth with elected kings. By the late 1700s, however, Poland had been\\nweakened by a series of wars with its neighbors. In 1795, it was conquered and divided among\\nRussia, Prussia (now Germany), and Austria. The once-mighty nation vanished from the world\\nmap, its existence denied for 123 long years. After World War I in 1918, Poland was\\nrestored as a sovereign nation. However, just 21 years later, Germany and\\nthe Soviet Union attacked,  intending to divide Poland between them. This aggression marked the beginning of World War II. Finally, in 1947, Poland was re-established as effectively a satellite puppet state of the Soviet Union. A new phase of economic and social development\\nstarted under communism, which is arguably, in the long run, an economic failure. However, it didn't start that way. For better or for worse, one thing that Soviet\\ndominance in the area and the common rule of the Communist party did was industrialize Poland,  particularly in the mining and manufacturing sector. However, in 1989, when the Iron Curtain finally fell,  Poland found itself on the brink of economic collapse. It had a large, inefficient agricultural sector,\\nterrible roads, and rail links, and an economy no larger than that of its neighbor. A stereotype had been created for Poland:\\na big, poor country with shambolic governments, dreadful roads, and eccentric habits. Old stereotypes die hard, but the facts paint\\nan increasingly different picture. By the grim standards of recent centuries, Poland has never been more secure, \\nprosperous, or better-run. If becoming rich is challenging for individuals,\\nit is even more challenging for nations, especially for a nation that was nearly bankrupt. Out of more than 190 countries tracked by\\nthe International Monetary Fund, fewer than 40 are considered wealthy or advanced economies. The rest are referred to as emerging nations,\\nand many of them have been in the emerging category for a long time. The last large country to enter the advanced\\nclass was South Korea, 20 years ago. The next major nation likely to join that\\nclub could be Poland,  an under-the-radar economic star. So, how did Poland become an unlikely island\\nof economic success? In the early 1990s, rigorous economic shock\\ntherapy put Poland on the right track. Market-oriented reforms included removing\\nprice controls, restraining wage increases, slashing subsidies for goods and services,\\nand balancing the budget. The cure was painful, but after a couple of\\nyears of sharp recession in 1990-91,  Poland started to grow again. It has not stopped since and received a further\\nboost when it joined the EU in 2004. Since then, economic growth has averaged 4%\\na year. GDP per person at purchasing-power parity\\nis now 80% of the EU average,  compared with 39% in 1990. Moreover, Poland was the only major European\\neconomy that didn't experience a recession during the financial crisis. This was due to a combination of luck and\\neffective fiscal and monetary policies. Poland's flexible exchange rate for the zloty,\\nlimited reliance on international trade, and low levels of household and corporate debt\\nalso contributed to its resilience. This strong economic performance has elevated\\nPoland's extra weight in the EU, both economically and politically, making it one of the key\\nmember countries alongside Germany, Britain, France, Italy, and Spain. However, Poland's economic success was made\\npossible due to its utilization of the industrialization legacy from the Communist era. By attracting foreign investments from Western\\ncountries, Poland was able to stimulate its domestic production and integrate its economy\\ninto global supply chains. As a result, Poland, along with its neighboring\\ncountries in the Visegrad Group, has become a significant player in industries such as\\nautomotive and electronics. Domestic firms in Poland serve as suppliers\\nto international manufacturers,  particularly those from Germany. Poland is following a path similar to the\\nAsian success stories by becoming a manufacturing powerhouse, even though this journey is more\\nchallenging today. Manufacturing is declining as a share of the\\nglobal economy, and with China taking much of this shrinking pie, only a few \\nmajor manufacturing nations are expanding  their share of global exports. This select group of around half a dozen countries\\nincludes South Korea, the Czech Republic  — and Poland. First and foremost, Poland has made significant progress in establishing a favorable \\nbusiness environment. They have embraced economic reforms, encouraged\\ninnovation, and developed a strong infrastructure that attracts both domestic and foreign investments. Poland's strategic geographical location at\\nthe crossroads of Europe has also positioned it as a gateway for trade and investment,\\nwhich has further fueled its growth. Poland is the largest country in Central and\\nEastern Europe and the 9th largest in Europe. 65% of its population is at working age, which\\nmeans a workforce of 22.7 million people. The combination of human capital \\nand cheap skilled labor  attracts foreign entrepreneurs to invest in Poland. Each year, Polish universities \\nproduce 37,500 engineers,  ranking second in the EU after Germany. The presence of talented and well-educated\\nemployees, along with a supportive environment for start-ups, has attracted the most Venture\\nCapital investments in the region. Additionally, Poland's focus on education\\nand skills development has helped cultivate a talented workforce, which is a crucial asset\\nin today's competitive global landscape. Since 2000, Poland has spent an average of\\n4.5% of GDP on education,  which is above EU average. It consistently ranks among the top five or\\nsix in reading, math, and science out of 38 OECD countries, outperforming wealthier nations\\nlike Britain, France, or Germany. This strong educational foundation lays the\\ngroundwork for continued robust economic growth. Poles also work hard, on average 39 hours\\nper week, more than the notoriously hard-working Americans and well ahead of British, French\\nor German counterparts. One of the most important features of the\\nPolish economy is its large domestic consumer market, which makes up 61% of GDP. This exceeds the EU average and has similarities\\nwith the US. Household consumption, driven by a robust\\nlabor market and wage growth, is expected to continue as a key driving force for the\\nPolish economy. In terms of infrastructure investments, Poland\\nhas been the largest beneficiary of EU funds, receiving €102 billion from 2007 to 2013\\nand €106 billion between 2014 to 2020. This has significantly benefited the construction\\nand real estate sectors, fueled by infrastructure projects and the expansion of global service\\ncenters in Poland, with international companies such as IBM, Citi Group, Credit Suisse and\\nCapgemini  relocating part of their operations to Poland. It has also managed to tap into robust sources\\nof innovation in the 'New economy.' One of the fastest-growing sectors is video\\ngame development. A report by the Polish Agency for Enterprise\\nDevelopment has found Poland's video gaming workforce as one of the largest in Europe. The report, titled The Game Industry of Poland\\nReport 2023, highlights that the Polish games industry is growing consistently with record\\nnumbers year after year. Currently, there are over 300 game developing\\ncompanies operating in Poland and over 20 are listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. However, the fact is that Eastern European\\ngrowth has heavily relied on capital  and expertise from the West. Foreign companies play a significant role\\nin Polish exports  and employ a large portion of the workforce. This means that profits are often transferred abroad,  which weakens the ability of domestic firms to scale up. Poland is setting records in terms of foreign\\ndirect investment (FDI) inflows, and it is well-positioned to benefit from the global\\ntrend of nearshoring supply chains. However, FDIs come with a double-edged sword. They stimulate growth but also reinforce reliance\\non external sources and may discourage local investments in domestic economic capabilities. For instance, in the entire Central and Eastern\\nEuropean region, only one company, the Polish state-owned oil refiner PKN Orlen, appears\\non the Fortune Global 500 list. The biggest challenge for Poland's economy\\nis to avoid the middle-income trap and prevent getting stuck at its current level. Poles are not saving and investing enough\\nfor the economy to transition from being Western Europe's primary subcontractor to one with\\nglobal, innovative Polish companies. Over the last 10 years, the average saving\\nrate has been only 21% of GDP, and the average investment rate has been 24% of GDP, both\\nbelow the EU average. The country currently allocates less than\\n1.5 percent of GDP to R&D, roughly half the Western European average. Demography is another concern for Poland's\\neconomy. It has one of the lowest fertility rates in\\nthe EU and continues to experience emigration. Approximately two million Poles emigrated\\nafter the country's entry into the EU, with about half of them moving to the UK. Mass emigration was driven partly by unemployment\\nat home, which remained persistently high for many years, but it has now reached its\\nlowest level since 1990. Moreover, Poland faces a significant challenge\\nin transitioning to clean energy, as it has the most fossil fuel-heavy energy mix in the EU. If the necessary investments are delayed,\\nthis could impact the competitiveness of the Polish industry, which has been the primary\\ndriver of growth so far. Poland's booming economy plays a crucial role\\nin the EU's response to the war in Ukraine. Its strong economic growth in recent decades\\nhas made investments in advanced military equipment like modern tanks and aircraft possible. Additionally, Poland's flourishing enterprise\\nsector and increasing demand for labor have allowed the country to efficiently accommodate\\na significant influx of refugees. The ongoing historical events are unlikely to significantly impact \\nEurope's balance of power. The European Union is primarily founded on\\ntrade and economic interests, and Poland currently holds a peripheral position in this institutional\\nframework. However, it will require a genuine commitment\\nto nurture domestic economic capacities in the landscape of a globalized and fast-paced\\neconomy. And in Poland, such a commitment is still\\nlargely confined to the realm of political speeches and wishful thinking. But at least they carry their head high when\\nthey go. These days Poland’s voice abroad once again\\ncounts for something.\",\n",
       " '\\ufeffPoland’s military has been going\\xa0\\nthrough a massive transformation,\\xa0\\xa0 possibly resulting in it becoming the next\\xa0\\nnumber one military superpower in Europe,\\xa0\\xa0 and it’s making Putin’s blood run cold. \\nAfter centuries of domination by foreign powers,\\xa0\\xa0 Poland freed itself from Communist rule in\\xa0\\n1989 and joined NATO a decade later. This\\xa0\\xa0 was a critical turning point not only for NATO,\\xa0\\nbut for Poland itself, heralding the start of a\\xa0\\xa0 new era in Warsaw’s international relations. Long\\xa0\\nthe plaything of great powers like Germany (and\\xa0\\xa0 its predecessor state Prussia), Austria, and\\xa0\\nRussia, which had partitioned its territory\\xa0\\xa0 several times and oppressed its people in\\xa0\\nnumerous, brutal ways, Poland is now on the\\xa0\\xa0 fast track to becoming a great power itself. \\nIn the year 2023, Poland is stronger than\\xa0\\xa0 at any point since its glory days in the\\xa0\\n17th century, when the Polish-Lithuanian\\xa0\\xa0 Commonwealth dominated much of Eastern\\xa0\\nEurope, and it is getting stronger still. \\n\\xa0 Let’s take a look at this incredible evolution. \\nHow is Poland transforming itself into a\\xa0\\xa0 great power and what does it mean for\\xa0\\nthat country, Europe, and the world?\\n\\xa0 The entrance of Poland into NATO was a major\\xa0\\ngeopolitical advantage to the alliance. \\n\\xa0 During the Cold War, the alliance struggled\\xa0\\nto contain the Soviet Union, as it and its\\xa0\\xa0 satellite states in the Warsaw Pact stretched\\xa0\\nwestward all the way to central Germany. If it\\xa0\\xa0 so desired to move further west, NATO’s forces\\xa0\\non the European Continent would be outnumbered\\xa0\\xa0 and the Communist forces could all concentrate\\xa0\\non a narrower front in the European Plain.\\n\\xa0 Poland’s accession to the Western bloc completely\\xa0\\nreversed this geostrategic situation. It was now\\xa0\\xa0 the new, post-Soviet Russian Federation that\\xa0\\nfaced the geographical disadvantage, as NATO’s\\xa0\\xa0 forces could concentrate and Russia had a much\\xa0\\nbroader area of the European Plain to defend\\xa0\\xa0 should war break out. Poland’s accession to NATO\\xa0\\nalso cut Russia off from much of the Baltic Sea,\\xa0\\xa0 as its coastline forms part of a natural\\xa0\\nchokepoint with Sweden, which in 2023 also\\xa0\\xa0 has pending NATO membership. Put simply, on land\\xa0\\nand sea, Poland’s joining NATO was one of the\\xa0\\xa0 biggest geopolitical and geostrategic disasters\\xa0\\nfor Russia after the end of the Cold War.\\n\\xa0 However, Poland is no mere passive player in\\xa0\\nthe alliance. It does not contribute to the\\xa0\\xa0 “free rider” problem in NATO that President Obama\\xa0\\nlamented in a 2016 interview with The Atlantic,\\xa0\\xa0 and his successor, President Trump, repeatedly\\xa0\\nbrought up in bellicose ways in order to try\\xa0\\xa0 to get NATO members to pay more. Poland actually\\xa0\\ncarries its weight in NATO’s collective security.\\xa0\\xa0 As of July 2023, it has spent 2.42% of its GDP\\xa0\\non defense, well above the 2% benchmark that the\\xa0\\xa0 alliance considers its standard. This makes Poland\\xa0\\nNATO’s third largest defense spender by GDP,\\xa0\\xa0 after Greece at 3.76% and the United States at\\xa0\\n3.47%. Poland increased its defense spending from\\xa0\\xa0 just under the 2% benchmark in 2014 to the current\\xa0\\n2.42% over the course of the decade. Undoubtedly,\\xa0\\xa0 this was done primarily in response to a more\\xa0\\naggressive Russia from 2014 onward. The Poles have\\xa0\\xa0 a long historical memory and do not want to be the\\xa0\\nsubject of Russian domination ever again. Russia’s\\xa0\\xa0 full-scale invasion of Ukraine strengthened\\xa0\\nthat resolve in Warsaw. Poland’s relative\\xa0\\xa0 level of defense spending compared to Germany’s\\xa0\\nestimated 2022 total of 1.44% has even prompted\\xa0\\xa0 many American lawmakers to propose strengthening\\xa0\\nthe United States’ military ties with Warsaw at\\xa0\\xa0 the expense of Berlin. Some American policymakers\\xa0\\nhave floated the idea of moving most of the\\xa0\\xa0 35,000 U.S. military personnel in Germany\\xa0\\nfurther east into Poland. A 2020 reshuffling\\xa0\\xa0 of some American troops from Germany\\xa0\\nto Poland, during the twilight days of\\xa0\\xa0 the German-skeptical Trump administration,\\xa0\\nwas a potential preview of that process.\\n\\xa0 Poland plans to do more, too. It has increased\\xa0\\nits defense spending to 4% of GDP in its 2023\\xa0\\xa0 budget. This would have it surpass Greece and the\\xa0\\nUnited States as the largest per capita military\\xa0\\xa0 spender in NATO, and put it at a level over\\xa0\\ntwice that of many other longtime NATO members,\\xa0\\xa0 such as France, Germany, Italy, and Spain.\\nAs the quantity of Poland’s military spending\\xa0\\xa0 has gone up, the quality has gone up, too. It\\xa0\\ncan afford to spend a hefty amount of money on\\xa0\\xa0 top of the line military equipment because Poland\\xa0\\nhas enjoyed breakneck economic growth compared\\xa0\\xa0 to the rest of Europe. It is one of the 21st\\xa0\\ncentury’s underreported miracle stories. Indeed,\\xa0\\xa0 since liberalization began in 1989, Poland\\xa0\\nhas experienced more economic growth than\\xa0\\xa0 the highly-touted “Asian Tiger”\\xa0\\ncountries like Taiwan, Singapore,\\xa0\\xa0 and South Korea. In effect, Poland has been\\xa0\\nthe tiger of Europe in the post-Cold War era.\\n\\xa0 Between 1989 and 2015, Poland’s GDP per capita\\xa0\\nbased on purchasing power more than doubled and\\xa0\\xa0 reached 65% of the level seen in Western\\xa0\\nEurope. It was the highest absolute and\\xa0\\xa0 relative level of wealth in that country\\xa0\\nsince the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth,\\xa0\\xa0 according to the Brookings Institution. As of\\xa0\\n2023, its GDP per capita is about $19,000.\\n\\xa0 Since 1991, Poland’s total nominal GDP has\\xa0\\ngrown by 126.35%, with an average annual growth\\xa0\\xa0 of 3.94%. Tellingly, Poland did not go into\\xa0\\nrecession in the financial crisis of 2008-2009,\\xa0\\xa0 unlike the larger European Union which\\xa0\\nshrank by 4.5%. Poland’s economy instead\\xa0\\xa0 grew by 4.2% in 2008 and 2.8% in 2009. While the\\xa0\\nso-called “PIIGS” countries (Portugal, Ireland,\\xa0\\xa0 Italy, Greece, and Spain) struggled with debt\\xa0\\ncrises and austerity measures at that time,\\xa0\\xa0 Poland continued ahead with its economic growth.\\xa0\\nThe Polish economy shrank by 2.02% in 2020 at the\\xa0\\xa0 height of the Covid-19 pandemic, but it weathered\\xa0\\nthe viral storm better than many other countries,\\xa0\\xa0 and bounced back incredibly strongly with a 6.85%\\xa0\\ngrowth rate in 2021. All of this speaks highly of\\xa0\\xa0 the robust and diversified economy that Poland\\xa0\\nhas created in its modern, post-Communist era.\\n\\xa0 Poland still places modestly in an absolute\\xa0\\nranking of the world’s economies, especially\\xa0\\xa0 compared to its NATO peers. It has the world’s\\xa0\\n21st largest economy in GDP by 2022 dollars, with\\xa0\\xa0 a total of $688 billion. Still, the country’s\\xa0\\neconomic growth has been such a success story\\xa0\\xa0 that some observers have estimated it will have\\xa0\\na larger economy than the United Kingdom by 2030\\xa0\\xa0 if its current trajectory continues. Already,\\xa0\\nby GDP per capita at purchasing power parity,\\xa0\\xa0 major cities in Poland like Warsaw, Poznan,\\xa0\\nKrakow, and Wroclaw are richer than major cities\\xa0\\xa0 in the United Kingdom like Birmingham, Manchester,\\xa0\\nand Liverpool. Although Poland’s total GDP per\\xa0\\xa0 capita still significantly lags the United Kingdom\\xa0\\nat $46,000, for the Poles, the trend is their\\xa0\\xa0 friend. Their current GDP per capita is almost 11\\xa0\\ntimes higher than what it was in 1990, when it was\\xa0\\xa0 only at a level of $1,731. The days of the food\\xa0\\nshortages and lack of other basic necessities that\\xa0\\xa0 the Poles experienced under Communist rule,\\xa0\\nparticularly in the 1980s, are long gone.\\n\\xa0 The country’s prosperity can be measured in\\xa0\\nanother way, too. After it joined the European\\xa0\\xa0 Union in 2004, hundreds of thousands of Poles left\\xa0\\nPoland to seek opportunity in the United Kingdom,\\xa0\\xa0 which as a fellow member of the European\\xa0\\nUnion back then, was easy for them to do. Now,\\xa0\\xa0 the situation has turned on its head, as Poles\\xa0\\nwho immigrated to Britain are now emigrating\\xa0\\xa0 and returning home for better opportunities\\xa0\\nthan the sluggish British economy can afford\\xa0\\xa0 them. The Polish government is keen to hurry\\xa0\\nthe process along. Its finance ministry has\\xa0\\xa0 created a program called the “Polish Deal,” which\\xa0\\noffers a 0% income tax for the first four years\\xa0\\xa0 to Polish emigres who decide to return home.\\nBut Polish expatriates are not the only people\\xa0\\xa0 seeking a better life there. The situation has\\xa0\\nreversed so much that many British and other\\xa0\\xa0 Western European expatriates are moving\\xa0\\ninto Poland, often commenting highly about\\xa0\\xa0 the good standard of living and economic\\xa0\\nopportunity there for an affordable price.\\n\\xa0 Poland’s economy has become a hotbed for\\xa0\\ntechnological innovation and manufacturing,\\xa0\\xa0 and it has one of the most highly-educated\\xa0\\nworkforces in Europe, with about one in two young\\xa0\\xa0 Poles having achieved a post-secondary education.\\xa0\\nForeign tech companies like Google and Microsoft\\xa0\\xa0 are opening data centers in Poland. Meanwhile, the\\xa0\\nSwedish battery manufacturer Northvolt completed\\xa0\\xa0 its construction of its factory in Poland in\\xa0\\nMay 2023. It is the largest factory for energy\\xa0\\xa0 storage systems in Europe. Poland also has 115\\xa0\\naerospace companies working in what is known as\\xa0\\xa0 its Aviation Valley, an area in the southeast\\xa0\\nof the country that has a high number of pilot\\xa0\\xa0 training centers and industrial and scientific\\xa0\\nresearch facilities. About 35,000 people are\\xa0\\xa0 employed there among 180 different members\\xa0\\nthat do about 3.5 billion euros in sales,\\xa0\\xa0 according to the Aviation Valley Association. The\\xa0\\nAssociation’s long-term objective is to make its\\xa0\\xa0 area one of Europe’s leading aerospace regions.\\nPoland’s post-Communist financial success is all\\xa0\\xa0 the more remarkable when one considers that\\xa0\\nits population is declining despite the huge\\xa0\\xa0 economic growth. Its fertility rate is only about\\xa0\\n1.4 births per woman, well below the 2.1 needed\\xa0\\xa0 for population replacement. By the end of the\\xa0\\ncentury, demographers estimate that Poland will\\xa0\\xa0 have a population of about 23 million people,\\xa0\\nonly a little more than half what it has today.\\xa0\\xa0 With this in mind, it is possible that Poland’s\\xa0\\nleaders believe they need to build a top of the\\xa0\\xa0 line military now, while their country’s\\xa0\\npopulation and economy is at a high point.\\n\\xa0 Either way, the wealth generated by its economic\\xa0\\ngrowth has allowed Poland to increase the quality\\xa0\\xa0 and quantity of its military. It plans to\\xa0\\ndouble the size of its standing army to\\xa0\\xa0 a total of 300,000 troops by 2035. It is also\\xa0\\ninvesting heavily in a modern technological and\\xa0\\xa0 capital-rich military with some of the world’s\\xa0\\nmost advanced weapons systems. As part of this\\xa0\\xa0 process, Poland has deepened ties with the\\xa0\\nUnited States and South Korea in particular.\\n\\xa0 First, Poland is creating a modern air fleet\\xa0\\nbased on the fifth generation F-35 Lightning\\xa0\\xa0 II fighter jet. Its initial order is\\xa0\\nfor 32 of these planes. Meanwhile,\\xa0\\xa0 Poland plans to rid itself of older Soviet-era\\xa0\\nplanes like the fourth generation MiG-29,\\xa0\\xa0 which it is often keen to donate to Ukraine for\\xa0\\nthe fight against Russia. Supplementing the F-35\\xa0\\xa0 is an order of 48 South Korean FA-50 planes, the\\xa0\\nfirst ten of which were delivered in July 2023.\\xa0\\xa0 The FA-50 is a light combat aircraft introduced in\\xa0\\n2005. The jet is capable of supersonic flight and\\xa0\\xa0 performing air-to-air or air-to-ground missions.\\xa0\\nJust as importantly, the FA-50 is one of the\\xa0\\xa0 world’s few supersonic training aircraft, making\\xa0\\nit an ideal choice to train Polish pilots to\\xa0\\xa0 operate the F-35. 96 American AH-54 Apache attack\\xa0\\nhelicopters are also on the menu for the Poles.\\n\\xa0 Poland is modernizing its tank and armored\\xa0\\nforces, too. It intends to buy 116 American\\xa0\\xa0 M1A1 Abrams tanks and 250 of the newer M1A2 Abrams\\xa0\\ntanks. Warsaw plans to supplement this force with\\xa0\\xa0 1,000 South Korean K2 main battle tanks. This is\\xa0\\nin addition to its own force of 1,000 Polish-made\\xa0\\xa0 Borsuk infantry fighting vehicles. Meanwhile,\\xa0\\nPoland is steadily donating the Soviet-era T-72\\xa0\\xa0 tanks in its arsenal to Ukraine. For the Poles,\\xa0\\nthese old systems are no longer desirable.\\n\\xa0 Poland is modernizing its artillery forces\\xa0\\nas well. The government in Warsaw is spending\\xa0\\xa0 $10 billion on the American HIMARS rocket\\xa0\\nartillery system which proved so devastating\\xa0\\xa0 to Russian forces in Ukraine in 2022. It has\\xa0\\npurchased 18 HIMARS systems as of March 2023,\\xa0\\xa0 spending $414 million on this platform, and\\xa0\\nthis is just the beginning. Poland plans to\\xa0\\xa0 buy a total of 500 HIMARS systems from the United\\xa0\\nStates, which will include 45 ATACMS missiles,\\xa0\\xa0 as part of a $10 billion deal. Considering how\\xa0\\nmuch damage only 16 or so HIMARS systems did to\\xa0\\xa0 Russia in Ukraine in the late summer and autumn\\xa0\\noffensives in the Kharkiv and Kherson Oblasts in\\xa0\\xa0 2022 – without the long-range ATACMS missile\\xa0\\n– this would be a formidable force for the\\xa0\\xa0 Poles indeed. Supplementing HIMARS are 288 South\\xa0\\nKorean Chunmoo multiple launch rocket systems.\\n\\xa0 The Poles desire modern tube artillery systems\\xa0\\nas well. As part of this effort, they are in\\xa0\\xa0 the process of purchasing South Korean K9A1\\xa0\\nself-propelled howitzers. These systems have a\\xa0\\xa0 range of 34 miles. 600 of these platforms are now\\xa0\\nin the country. More are likely still to come.\\n\\xa0 Poland is also buying about $5 billion worth\\xa0\\nof Patriot air defense missiles from the United\\xa0\\xa0 States and is spending $2.4 billion for British\\xa0\\nCAMM air defense missiles. Russian air and drone\\xa0\\xa0 strikes against Ukrainian cities and civilian\\xa0\\ninfrastructure undoubtedly set off alarm bells\\xa0\\xa0 among government officials in Warsaw. Poland is\\xa0\\ncreating a modern air defense network to ensure\\xa0\\xa0 the same does not happen to its cities.\\nPoland’s military buildup in size and\\xa0\\xa0 technological quality is rapidly creating the\\xa0\\nmost formidable fighting force on the European\\xa0\\xa0 Continent. When completed, the 300,000 man\\xa0\\nstanding army will be the largest in Europe by\\xa0\\xa0 number of boots on the ground. In size, readiness,\\xa0\\nand technological capability, Poland is set to\\xa0\\xa0 become the most militarily powerful it has been\\xa0\\nsince its golden age in the Polish-Lithuanian\\xa0\\xa0 Commonwealth of the 17th century, which, the\\xa0\\nPoles will remember fondly. The Commonwealth\\xa0\\xa0 routinely defeated Russian forces. In fact, the\\xa0\\nPolish-Lithuanian Commonwealth defeated Russia in\\xa0\\xa0 the early 17th century and even occupied Moscow,\\xa0\\nsomething that Napoleon and Hitler failed to do,\\xa0\\xa0 and a few only accomplished by one other fighting\\xa0\\nforce – the Mongols. For a little while, the Poles\\xa0\\xa0 and their Russian Boyar collaborators installed\\xa0\\nthe son of King Sigismund III of Poland as the\\xa0\\xa0 Russian Czar. This episode was in many ways the\\xa0\\nheight of the Commonwealth’s power, but a century\\xa0\\xa0 later, the tide would turn completely, and Poland\\xa0\\nwould cease to exist as a state. Poland’s new\\xa0\\xa0 military is a source of pride, a signal that the\\xa0\\nbad times of partition, occupation, and Communism\\xa0\\xa0 have finally been banished and Poland is retaking\\xa0\\nits place among the great powers of Europe.\\n\\xa0 For the Poles, the 21st century military buildup\\xa0\\nand change in their country’s status is not only\\xa0\\xa0 a matter of pride. It is partially a\\xa0\\nmatter of necessity, and for current,\\xa0\\xa0 not just historical reasons. Poland shares\\xa0\\na border with the heavily-fortified and\\xa0\\xa0 nuclear-armed Russian enclave of Kaliningrad in\\xa0\\nthe north. Russian figures show that about 100,000\\xa0\\xa0 troops are stationed in this tight area, but\\xa0\\nWestern experts believe the number might be twice\\xa0\\xa0 that. Kaliningrad is also home to Russia’s Baltic\\xa0\\nFleet. Furthermore, Kaliningrad’s presence along\\xa0\\xa0 the borders of Poland and Lithuania creates a rare\\xa0\\nweakness in NATO’s geostrategic position. This\\xa0\\xa0 weakness is known as the Suwalki Gap, the 40-mile\\xa0\\ncorridor across the Polish-Lithuanian border\\xa0\\xa0 that separates Kaliningrad with Russia’s vassal\\xa0\\nstate Belarus. A pincer offensive eastward from\\xa0\\xa0 Kaliningrad and westward from Belarus threatens to\\xa0\\ncut the three Baltic States – Lithuania, Estonia,\\xa0\\xa0 and Latvia, off from Poland and the rest of\\xa0\\nNATO by land. Poland would see heavy fighting\\xa0\\xa0 in such an operation. Meanwhile, Kaliningrad is\\xa0\\nonly about 240 miles north of Warsaw. With such\\xa0\\xa0 densely-concentrated forces in the enclave, a\\xa0\\nstrong military capable of meeting a potential\\xa0\\xa0 Russian offensive from its westernmost bastion\\xa0\\nis a matter of national survival. It presents a\\xa0\\xa0 demand for increased defense spending that NATO\\xa0\\nstates further to the west simply do not have.\\xa0\\xa0 In effect, those countries can afford to be the\\xa0\\n“free riders” President Obama complained about.\\xa0\\xa0 Poland does not have that luxury. Its territory\\xa0\\nis the one that would be wrecked if a broader\\xa0\\xa0 war were to ever break out in Europe again.\\nGermany presents an additional demand on Poland\\xa0\\xa0 to increase its military readiness. For historical\\xa0\\nreasons, Poland was uneasy with the comparatively\\xa0\\xa0 warm relationship Germany shared with Russia prior\\xa0\\nto the invasion of Ukraine. This situation came\\xa0\\xa0 partially as a result of the former’s heavy\\xa0\\ndependency on Russian oil and natural gas.\\xa0\\xa0 The Nordstream Pipeline across the Baltic from\\xa0\\nRussian to German territory was perhaps the best\\xa0\\xa0 example of this chummy relationship. Undoubtedly,\\xa0\\nGermany and Russia’s flirtation called to mind the\\xa0\\xa0 Ribbentrop Pact – the non-aggression agreement\\xa0\\nbetween Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in\\xa0\\xa0 1939 that partitioned Poland between them – among\\xa0\\nsome policymakers in Warsaw. Poland’s military\\xa0\\xa0 expansion is a way to put pressure on the Germans\\xa0\\nto pay their fair share of NATO’s defense and to\\xa0\\xa0 remember who their true ally in the 21st century\\xa0\\nis. For now, the move seems to be paying off,\\xa0\\xa0 as Germany has declared it will increase its\\xa0\\ndefense spending to the NATO benchmark 2% of GDP\\xa0\\xa0 in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. There\\xa0\\nare many skeptics who say they have heard this\\xa0\\xa0 from Berlin many times before, however. Warsaw\\xa0\\nprobably has a disproportionate amount of them.\\n\\xa0 Poland has also been a leading provider of\\xa0\\nmilitary aid to Ukraine, with 2.48 billion\\xa0\\xa0 Euros worth. This is far behind countries like\\xa0\\nthe United States, United Kingdom, and Germany,\\xa0\\xa0 but Poland’s aid is the third largest\\xa0\\nof any individual country in Europe and\\xa0\\xa0 disproportionate to its GDP. In contrast, the EU\\xa0\\ninstitutions have mostly provided financial aid,\\xa0\\xa0 rather than military. Ukraine’s defense is\\xa0\\na necessity for Poland. The last thing the\\xa0\\xa0 Poles want is for Russia to get even closer\\xa0\\nto their border. Russia’s aims in Ukraine\\xa0\\xa0 are antithetical to Poland’s very existence.\\nFor the United States, Poland’s rise to a military\\xa0\\xa0 great power on the European Continent is a most\\xa0\\nwelcome development, to the point that Washington\\xa0\\xa0 is even willing to lend a hand in the process.\\xa0\\nIn 2022, the United States Congress approved a\\xa0\\xa0 $288.6 million military financing package\\xa0\\nto Poland to speed its arms buildup along.\\xa0\\xa0 The stated purpose was to “deter and defend”\\xa0\\nagainst further Russian aggression in Europe.\\xa0\\xa0 The aid mutually benefits both countries. For\\xa0\\nWashington, containing Beijing’s ambitions in the\\xa0\\xa0 Indo-Pacific region is now the number one foreign\\xa0\\npolicy priority, even with Russia’s invasion of\\xa0\\xa0 Ukraine. With Europe now only a secondary theater\\xa0\\nin the United States’ geopolitical strategy,\\xa0\\xa0 Poland’s military buildup is a much-welcome\\xa0\\nboost for America’s goals, as it will reduce\\xa0\\xa0 the European defense burden which has been so\\xa0\\ndisproportionately carried by the superpower\\xa0\\xa0 across the Atlantic since World War II.\\nThe American help is welcome for Warsaw,\\xa0\\xa0 too. Poland’s military spending comes at a high\\xa0\\nprice tag – about 85 billion Euros’ worth on\\xa0\\xa0 new weapons by 2030 – and with risks to come at\\xa0\\nthe expense of civilian projects. Inflation in\\xa0\\xa0 Poland is also running high, at 17%, and economic\\xa0\\ngrowth, though still high, is slowing. There is\\xa0\\xa0 a risk of resource strain with such high levels\\xa0\\nof military spending. However, the leadership in\\xa0\\xa0 Warsaw believes that the price of the arms buildup\\xa0\\nis affordable and of secondary concern. Jaroslaw\\xa0\\xa0 Kaczynski, the chairman of Poland’s ruling Law\\xa0\\nand Justice Party, summed up the mentality behind\\xa0\\xa0 this expansion in military spending in early\\xa0\\n2023 when he said: “it is better to be in debt,\\xa0\\xa0 and even have to make cuts to budgets in other\\xa0\\nareas, than to be occupied. Whoever has seen what\\xa0\\xa0 is happening in Ukraine should have no doubt about\\xa0\\nthis.” Kaczynski, a former Polish Prime Minister,\\xa0\\xa0 is considered one of Warsaw’s leading power\\xa0\\nbrokers. He was born in 1949 and remembers the\\xa0\\xa0 bad old days, where he was an active member in\\xa0\\nanti-Communist circles in Poland. He and other\\xa0\\xa0 politicians of his generation understand what is\\xa0\\nat stake and what needs to be protected. For them,\\xa0\\xa0 Poland’s ascendancy to a military great power is\\xa0\\nnot only a matter of pride, but one of survival.\\n\\xa0 Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its numerous and\\xa0\\nvaried war crimes there stirred both recent and\\xa0\\xa0 deep historical demons in Warsaw. The response\\xa0\\nhas been to build a first-rate military that\\xa0\\xa0 will soon be without peer on the European\\xa0\\nContinent – if all goes according to plan. \\n\\xa0 But will it?

sites\\xa0\\xa0 along the way it is around one o'clock and it\\xa0\\nis busy you guys very busy busy busy for a good\\xa0\\xa0 reason though like look how beautiful this is\\xa0\\nabsolutely perfect

windows at one\\xa0\\npoint I'd buy it I can't see greens you could\\xa0\\xa0 pretend like that's green right now because\\xa0\\nof the green Windows it doesn't look great so if you guys have been watching any of\\xa0\\nour recent videos we visited so many old\\xa0\\xa0 towns lately this one might take\\xa0\\nthe cake though all the different\\xa0\\xa0 colors of buildings even the buildings the\\xa0\\nlittle details so much artwork in there it\\xa0\\xa0 really stands out very unique so\\xa0\\ndifferent what a stunning place so right here in the center of Old Town is one of\\xa0\\nits most recognizable symbols it is the Fountain\\xa0\\xa0 of Neptune now Neptune is the god of sea this\\xa0\\nwas first erected in 1549 as the legend goes\\xa0\\xa0 Neptune got tired of all the people throwing in\\xa0\\ngold coins in the spouting wishing for luck and\\xa0\\xa0 Fortune so it took its Trident and crushed all\\xa0\\nthose coins making them worthless and that's\\xa0\\xa0 how the drink here goldslogger got started it's a\\xa0\\nfamous Vodka it's known for its tiny golden flakes beautiful music so this old town\\xa0\\nis very hectic there are so many\\xa0\\xa0 people here today too many but Poland\\xa0\\nis known for a vodka not a vodka the\\xa0\\xa0 Vodka all the vodkas I think they're like\\xa0\\nthe biggest vodka selection in the entire\\xa0\\xa0 world so we need to relax a little bit\\xa0\\nso it's time to go try some Polish vodka oh this looks like a perfect spot doesn't it\\xa0\\ncan't be with your best shot so I would enjoy\\xa0\\xa0 what vodka to get I'm not sure what's traditional\\xa0\\nhe recommend actually getting a beer so we got a\\xa0\\xa0 local beer which is more your style anyway\\xa0\\nwhich is more of my style we're not used to\\xa0\\xa0 taking vodka shots that's for sure and Sammy\\xa0\\ngot the vodka sour so I'm gonna try hers first wow that is so easy very lemony and\\xa0\\nsweet I hardly taste any liquor there but\\xa0\\xa0 it's delicious you're gonna love this babe just taking a sip cheers you guys\\xa0\\xa0 that we never drink liquor drinks and like\\xa0\\nlike I've had more shots in the past two\\xa0\\xa0 weeks I've had in my entire life together\\xa0\\nthat's true let's harm in one more I know oh so tart and good isn't it easy yes and it's so\\xa0\\ncalm and relaxing in here so this other guy at the\\xa0\\xa0 bar was

about the people not the destinations I\\xa0\\xa0 know that's so cheesy to say but it's the truth\\xa0\\nno it's true I found that when we're when I'm\\xa0\\xa0 asking people to take their photos or to be\\xa0\\nin our videos it's so nice if you do strike\\xa0\\xa0 up conversations with them and you get to know\\xa0\\nyou know where they're from what they're doing\\xa0\\xa0 and why they're traveling what interests them it's\\xa0\\njust it's really cool it's my new favorite thing\\xa0\\xa0 to do so I hope you guys enjoy it as well yeah\\xa0\\nhey thank you man appreciate it have a good day this street is so different from the other\\xa0\\nOld Town just because there are so many\\xa0\\xa0 people like performing there are people\\xa0\\nwith snakes like this guy holy cow is huge a lot of street performers musicians\\xa0\\nit is pretty awesome he's not scared at all selling selling pictures of\\xa0\\nsnakes no more vodka for her so I had to go into three different places

our tickets head up\\xa0\\nthe tower it was four dollars a person\\xa0\\xa0 400 no I'm never gonna make it this is so nice wow such incredible views up here it's definitely\\xa0\\nworth the climb

pretty\\xa0\\nexcited we haven't been in a brewery in a\\xa0\\xa0 long time and they have a Session IPA I can't\\xa0\\nwait to try it it looks like a uh a hazy IPA\\xa0\\xa0 yeah a little bitterness just a tiny bit though\\xa0\\nvery hoppy I like it and fruity I love it we did\\xa0\\xa0 forget to mention earlier that all those drinks\\xa0\\nthe ones we got and the ones we probably bought\\xa0\\xa0 for the people outside for only eleven dollars\\xa0\\na yummy bowl of soup all of the reviews here\\xa0\\xa0 just said to order the fish soup so that's what\\xa0\\nwe did lots of Tomatoes vegetable a clear broth\\xa0\\xa0 and mussels and some fish in here actually it's\\xa0\\nvery mild it's not like overly seasoned to be\\xa0\\xa0 honest it could use some salt pepper our waitress\\xa0\\nis so sweet she brought me an American pale to try\\xa0\\xa0 it's a little glass look how awesome\\xa0\\nthis glasses interesting a little sour\\xa0\\xa0 I don't think Tommy enjoyed this cute little\\xa0\\nAmerican pale ale as much as I did has a very\\xa0\\xa0 like tart flavor I like it for the main\\xa0\\ndish I ordered their duck here and pulling\\xa0\\xa0 on every menu we've

ruined buildings that they\\xa0\\xa0 sent stabilize that you can walk through you can\\xa0\\nreally see the destruction from all the bombing as you walk through the outdoor Museum there's a\\xa0\\nbunch of information about the battle that took\\xa0\\xa0 place here it's also crazy to think about how the\\xa0\\nPolish soldiers held out against 10 times the size\\xa0\\xa0 of the German army they held out for seven days\\xa0\\nthere's also memorials to all the Polish soldiers\\xa0\\xa0 who died here come to this open air museum see the\\xa0\\nmemorial but also look at the beach you

       " ' Good morning, good evening, I\\'m UBA, UBA Żaneta, welcome to my channel! As you can see - we\\'re outside again, we\\'re in Tel-Aviv. My last video in which I was asking the Israelis what comes to their mind when they think about Poland became pretty popular A lot of you requested another video like that. Listen... If you asked me, I had to do it. I\\'m here, I\\'m in Tel-Aviv And after a year and a half we\\'ll be asking the same question: what comes to Israelis\\' mind when they think about \\nPoland. Let\\'s go! This video has subtitles in Polish, English and Hebrew. If you don\\'t see the subtitles on your screen and you\\'re watching this video on the desktop Click on the settings icon located in the right bottom corner > click on \\'Subtitles\\' and choose the language If you\\'re watching this video on a mobile device, click on the settings icon located in the right upper corner > click on \\'Subtitles\\' and choose the language. Good luck! First, I think about the Holocaust. I was in Poland, it\\'s a really beautiful place that I\\'d like to visit Poland... Our family. Yes, we\\'re both Poles, our family is Polish. There is a lot of people in Israel that are Polish. It is raised when it comes to origin  Poland? Unfortunately Auschwitz. My grandfather. Also a very conservative government that I quite support It stops the liberalism that sometimes exists in \"too democratic\" countries - You know this bags hanging around a shoulder? - Yes! - You should put it around here - I know, sometimes I do - So you\\'re from Poland? - Yes, as you can see - Good answer - Amazing I think there is a beautiful nature in Poland: lawns, forests, amazing places to travel - Have you ever been in Poland? - Yes - Where? - I don\\'t really remember, it was few years ago, I went there for a judo competition  I really enjoyed the atmosphere, the people, the culture. I think that besides the bad memories of the Holocaust and what the Jewish people went through there Today the culture there is amazing, there is a beautiful nature and amazing people  My origins, all my family is from Poland. That\\'s the first thing that comes to my mind. It wasn\\'t in the specific village, it was called \\'Kremlic\\'(?). I haven\\'t been there, but my grandfather came from there. This is what I know about Poland - I\\'m almost 100% Polish myself. We\\'ve recently seen a polish series on Netflix - Which one? - \\'Sexify\\' - Ah, yes, \\'Sexify\\' We watched 2 full seasons and we heard a lot of Polish. It was really cool to listen to what\\'s going on in Poland nowadays. This is a country that didn\\'t support the Jewish people during the Holocaust - quite the opposite. Not all the Poles didn\\'t help, there were Poles that helped. But there were also Poles that didn\\'t help. The majority, as it looks like, didn\\'t help - but it\\'s not accurate Something that can be illustrated - maybe yes, but in our historical education when we were young, Poland was one of the elements that cooperated with the Nazis  And supported them. This is why the stigma about Poland stayed until today But we don\\'t live in the past, we live in the present and we look forward for the future. Let\\'s hope that the relation between Poland and Israel will improve with time  And I hope that Poland will take responsibility for their part, even if it\\'s partial responsibility The fact that they shun it - that\\'s what caused most Israelis to doubt the Polish policy - Eurovision, they didn\\'t win - Oh wow, a lot, there was the trip to Poland, my girlfriends went there at 11th grade My first nanny was Polish. She came from Poland and raised me until I was 10. My father\\'s parents were born in Poland Poland is really my heritage Oh I like Poland because we live very close to Poland in Germany. We are very often in Szczecin and we have friends over there - That\\'s nice! What do you like there the most? - It\\'s part of the European Union so it\\'s very easy for us and very helpful that there are no borders And we have similar history so there are a lot of things that are quite common for us  - At this moment Eurovision - The second place on Eurovision - Second? No! - The 5th? - Poland? No, no way! - So which place? - Twenty-something  - Solo, Solo! - Yeah, Solo! Poland - for me personally is very interesting because I\\'ve never been there, although I had a connection flight with a stop there. We intend to visit. Also I know one thing: nowadays a lot of religious Breslaw people love to go to Uman in Ukraine. It\\'s hard for them to get to Kiev because of the situation. They go through Romania, Poland trying to get there - And I\\'d like to tell you that if you\\'re Polish, you\\'re very cute - Thank you, you both are also cute. - I\\'m happy that such a pretty girl is in Israel I\\'m half Polish, my grandmother and my grandfather were from Poland. First thing when I\\'m thinking about Poland: my grandfather had 7 siblings and my grandmother had 8 All of them were murdered during the Holocaust. One brother of my grandfather survived, also one sister of my grandmother  So obviously it\\'s very complicated. We, Israelis, know Poland in the context of Auschwitz, concentration camps and the Holocaust Of course, many years have passed, Poland is a beautiful country, there are great people, we love the Poles And I know that now Poland is fighting for the history - how the Polish people will be remembered. I know it\\'s very important for them To let you know - I\\'m on the Polish side on this matter: because I really think that it was all done by the Nazis. In fact There were Poles that cooperates with the Nazis - we need to remember that as well But it cannot stigmatise Poland because after all it was the Nazi Germany So as someone that half of his family was murdered during the Holocaust in Poland - I\\'m saying it was the Nazis, not Poles If my grandmother was alive, she would agree with me. She used to say that there were Poles that helped her - that\\'s her memories There were people that cooperated with the Nazis unfortunately and there were a lot of Poles that helped the Jews - It\\'s very close to us - She is a beautiful country and I really like Polin, they\\'re sometimes nice and this is like speaking Russian - It is similar to Russian - Yeah - Yeah we can understand each others a bit Look, there is a song of Zohar Argov - Which one? - About a Moroccan and a Pole. Poland sounds good to me Something European... Poland... In my mind I see it more like Europe, no?  - Have you been in Poland? - No, never - So you\\'re invited What comes to my mind? That every time people see her they say \\'Poland\\' Fairytales, forest, wolfs... - Behemoth is a great band. Nergal was here last week - Yeah, we were there, and you?  No, I was working and I couldn\\'t come, but my 3 children were there Holokaust, bad smell, not democratic regime, cold. Ofer, would you like to add something? Polish Jewry which is a very large and meaningful one in Israel. What left from it in Europe - came to Israel.  - Poland: camps, Holocaust - The trips to Poland Aaa Roman (sic!) Lewandowski, of course As you can see today we also got a lot of different answers, the opinions were diverse There are also a lot of people who are amazed by Poland and understand the historical context. This is very important in order to build bridges between us.

       " \"What's Poland like? My name is Krystyna. I live here in Warsaw. Today you are going to learn all about the sights, smells, sounds, tastes and feels of Poland. Let me show you what Poland looks like. Poland looks like a fairy tale. The castles, the villages, the mountains, the forests. Being here is like being in a storybook. Poland looks like a painting. Here in Zalipie we paint our houses with flowers\\nthat are inspired by our countryside. Poland looks like the high peaks\\nof the Tatras. Poland looks like rolling farmlands\\nthrough a train window. Looks like blueberry stained fingers. And a summer day in the Great Masurian Lakes. Visiting Poland\\nis like looking into the past. So much history has happened right here\\nand it's visible everywhere. One of the biggest events here in Gdansk\\nis St. Dominic’s Fair. Every summer, hundreds of artists,\\nmusicians and craftspeople come to the city for one of Europe's\\nlargest open air markets. Did you hear that? Every hour in Krakow, a commemorative horn \\nsounds above the main square. To me, Poland\\nsounds like a shipyard on the Baltic. Gdansk is best known for its shipyard. Once the birthplace of a revolution, it's\\nstill the coolest place in town. Poland sounds like the music of Chopin. Come and have a listen with me in the park. Poles love folklore and tradition. And of course, ringing bells. Poland tastes like the salt from Wieliczka Mine. When you're in Krakow, you must try an obwarzanek. \\nThe more poppy seeds, the better! Have you ever tried this? It’s called bigos and it’s a delicious cabbage stew.          One thing\\nyou need to try in Gdansk it's Goldwasser liqueur with a real flecks of gold in it. Beer with raspberry syrup is a summertime speciality.  For something more refreshing,\\ntry kompot - a classic beverage made from simmered fruits.  A holdover from the Soviet Union, milk bars are a uniquely Eastern European style \\nof cafeteria/restaurant hybrid where you can get cheap home-style meals \\nlike barszcz and schabowy. There are many great desserts in Poland, \\nbut nothing beats a szarlotka in a mountain hut. Whatever the case, \\nyou can’t go wrong with jelly-filled paczki. And of course, everybody loves pierogi. Did you know that you can even have them\\nfor dessert with fruit filling? Do you smell that? That’s the smell of the flowers \\nin the Royal Gardens of Lazienki Park. In St. Mary’s Basilica, incense fills the air. Poland smells like wild mushrooms. Picking them could be our national sport. Poland smells like fresh brewed tea \\nin a charming alleyway. Poland smells like a bonfire with friends. Poland smells like smoked cheese from a bacowka. You can find these smoke houses\\nall over the south of Poland. What does Poland feel like? Poland feels like the wind in your sails. Poland feels like Kashubian embroidery. There are seven colors.\\nDark blue is the sea. Light blue are the lakes. The lightest blue is the sky. Yellow is the sun. Black is hard work of Kashubian people. Red is love. So the best thing in Gdansk is the amber. We call it the gold of the Baltic. It's collected right here on our coast. I love seeing all of the variations\\nand craftsmanship of this beautiful stone. Poland feels like the hot breath of a dragon.  Poland feels like walking through time. Poland feels like the thrill of discovery. Poland feels like a warm welcome. Welcome! Thanks for watching Lonely Planet.

       " \"On September 11th, US lockheed martin, the\\nmaker of the famous himars rocket system, and the armaments agency of polish defense\\nministry signed an agreement to procure and integrate himars launchers into polish military. It’s a deal that’s been in the works for\\na year now, but has often been interpreted as not happening. Due to the ludicrous number of Himars launchers\\nrequested. But now the agreement has been signed, the\\nwhole deal is a step away from being realized. It has to be pointed out this is not yet the\\nfinal contract, but a framework agreement that’s been signed. Still, if and when the final contract is signed,\\nPoland will be getting a staggering four hundred and eighty six himars launcher loader module\\nkits. How is that going to affect polish military\\npower and how are those launchers gonna be used? Stay tuned. Welcome back. It’s important to say that the himars launcher\\nloader module kits are not entire himars launcher vehicles. But the launcher kits that go onto vehicles. That’s because the agreement stipulates\\nthe launhcers are to be integrated onto polish built jelcz 6 by 6 trucks. This image shows off nicely the current US\\nmade launcher vehicle with himars launcher, compared to the polish vehicle with the same\\nlauncher. First deliveries of the new system, to be\\ncalled Homar-A in the Polish army, are to start in 2026. The agreement says tens of thousands of rocket\\nammunitions will be produced. Those will not be the first himars systems\\nPoland will operate. IN 2019, Poland bought 20 Himars systems from\\nus. First of those were delivered earlier this\\nyear. Those cost some 400 million dollars. While this new deal is valued roughly at some\\n10 billion. So if and when it all goes through, Poland\\nwill be operating 506 Himars launcher vehicles. To just show how mind boggling that number\\nis - France is operating 9 MLRS vehicles. Sure, each has double the number of missiles,\\nbut still. Even before all the army cutbacks, when France\\nordered them at the end of cold war, France ordered just 57. The UK uses some 35 MLRS vehicles. Again double the number of missiles per vehicle,\\nbut still, it's some 7 times fewer ready to launch missiles and 14 times fewer vehicles. Germany, another big European military, uses\\n33 mlrs vehicles. So is there someone in NATO who uses more? Sort of. The US army uses 368 himars launchers, same\\nones Poland will be using. With the US Marine corps using 47 more. So Polish plans outnumber even the US current\\nnumbers. But, the marines are in the process of getting\\nmore himars launchers. They will increase the number of rocket artillery\\nbatteries from 7 to 21. So, in the near future, sort of around the\\ntime when Poland might start getting their local assembled himars, the marines might\\nbe using some 150 or so launchers in total. That would get the US to a grand total very\\nsimilar to polish one when it comes to himars. With perhaps just a few systems more. The US army is also eyeying increasing their\\nnumbers. Likely at the cost of other systems, as the\\narmy currently also operates some 226 mlrs systems. A year ago, the army issued a request for\\ninformation to companies, asking who can produce up to 480 himars systems up to year 2028. That doesn’t mean the army intends to procure\\nthat many but it does show interest in flexibility to get many new systems on a relatively short\\nnotice. For now, including the MLRS systems, the US\\narmy and the marines combined can be estimated to be aiming at fielding 740 to 900 rocket\\nartillery launchers, with a total potential of up to 54 hundred ready to launch missiles. So the US military is huge and it’s no wonder\\nit has way more equipment than other NATO militaries. But Poland, which is 35 times smaller economy\\nwise, is getting almost as many. It’s not just the 506 or so himars systems,\\nwhich basically matches the currently announced plans from the US, but Poland has another\\nmultiple rocket launcher system in store. In September 2023, Poland also signed an agreement\\nwith South Korean Hanwha to develop the homar-k system. That multiple rocket launcher systems is also\\nto use polish trucks and jointly developed launcher kits and missiles. It’s an addition to a previous agreement\\nwhich already saw poland receive the first korean K239 chunmoo system. 288 such systems will be produced for poland. It’s a heavier system than himars and carries\\ntwo 6 missile pods, sort of like the US MLRS. the truck carrying it is also a larger, 4\\naxle variant of the jelz truck, compared to the 3 axle truck carrying the himars launchers. Each pod can house either 239 milimeter missiles,\\nslightly larger than the missiles HIMars uses, which are of 227milimeter diameter. Or it can use a large ballistic missile instead. OR it will be able to use many smaller 122\\nmilimter rockets, which will be produced in poland. South korean 239 milimter missiles are very\\nsimilar to us gimlers from himars. They use satellite guidance and have a range\\nof 80 kilometers. Now, all those are massive numbers and it’s\\npossible Poland will not go through will procuring both 500 us and 300 south korean systems. Just like the us army may not ultimately get\\n500 more himars. But it’s still looking like a possibility. If it does go through with it, Poland might\\nactually have both more launcher systems and more missiles ready to launch than the US,\\ncome 2030 or so. Satellite guided artillery missiles like those\\nused by himars seemTo have proven their worth in last year’s operations, so its no wonder\\nmany countries around the world are seeking more of them. Poland is just a very extreme example. Even if it ultimately doesn’t quite reach\\nUS numbers, it’s on a course to field more rocket systems per capita than any other country\\nin the world. Including US, Russia and China. And do it by a wide margin. Will such numbers help Poland in future wars? That’s still unknown. Satellite guided artillery missiles are today\\nused like snipers. Perhaps firing entire salvo at once only when\\nthe target is actually a sprawling set of high value targets or when enemy anti-missile\\ndefenses are robust enough that a missile or two would not get through. With numbers mentioned for Poland, saturating\\nthe enemy would hardly be an issue. There’s virtually no air defense network\\nin the world that could afford to defend against hundreds of such missiles fired at once. The issue might be jamming the satellite navigation\\nsignal. That has occurred in Ukraine at times. But again, jammers are almost exclusively\\nground based. And are not effective when missiles are high\\nup, nor far away. So its a means of somewhat degrading precision. Which can again be partially mitigated by\\nsheer number of missiles fired. Also, in war, frontlines tend to be long and\\ndeep. No one can afford to cover all the targets\\nwith jammers. More often than not, satellite guided missiles\\nwould get through. Perhaps a bigger issue is one of target allocation. Having 500 launchers is great, but even if\\njust 300 are used actively on the frontline, that means 300 target sets are required, perhaps\\nevery day, to fully utilize those launchers. There may not be enough high value targets\\nout there, daily. Certainly, Poland doesn’t have the recon\\nassets and target processing capabilities to find hundreds of targets per day, deep\\ninside enemy territory. So what may happen is that polish missiles\\nwill much more often be used on the very frontline. For direct support against enemy bunkers,\\ntrucks, trenches and so on. Called into action by forward units, and not\\nby some higher up command. That’s a valid choice too, sure, but at\\nthat point one starts wondering if a similar effect could be achieved by using much cheaper\\nunguided rounds. Or even cheaper guided rounds, like for example\\nthe excalibur tube artillery round. It’s also possible, though, that Poland\\nand US and in this together, where Poland will be the effector, firing the missile,\\nwith the US being the party which finds and chooses targets. It still all depends on the number or missiles\\navailable. Himars contract mentioned tens of thousands\\nof missiles. While that may seem like a lot, 500 himars\\nlaunchers can use 3000 in one go, in theory. The entire US army and marine corps had some\\n55 thousand missiles, before Ukraine happened. Current production rate, which is being increased,\\nis well over 10 thousand a year. But still, if Poland gets, say 30 thousand\\ngimlers missiles for their himars, that’s gonna be enough for 10 reloads. Possibly expended in a few weeks of a high\\nintensity war, given the number of launchers available. The US, before the war, had some 60ish missiles\\nstockpiled per launcher pod, enough for just 6 reloads. So it remains to be seen if Poland will really\\nbe getting much bigger missile numbers. Still, Poland is surging ahead militarily. Missiles wise, it may even match the US. Or if the US goes a different route, it may\\neven slightly surpass it.\",\n",

It took 230\\xa0\\nyears to build the castle, a majority of which\\xa0\\xa0 was destroyed during World War II. Fortunately,\\xa0\\nmuch of the castle has been restored since then. Number 9. Poznan. Student travelers wanting to meet their Polish\\xa0\\npeers might want to visit Poznan, long known as\\xa0\\xa0 an academic center and home to Poland’s third\\xa0\\nlargest university. The city hosts many events,\\xa0\\xa0 including the International Theatre Festival that\\xa0\\ntakes place every summer. Major sites are easily\\xa0\\xa0 accessible by strolling the Royal-Imperial Route,\\xa0\\na walk set up especially for tourists. Athletes\\xa0\\xa0 may enjoy a visit to the artificial lake of Malta,\\xa0\\nhome to a ski slope, ice rink, and swimming pools. Number 8. Bialowieza Forest. The Bialowieza Forest is a large remnant of the\\xa0\\nprimeval forests that once covered much of Europe.\\xa0\\xa0 The forest straddles the border\\xa0\\nbetween Poland and Belarus,\\xa0\\xa0 and there are border crossings for tourists\\xa0\\non foot or on bicycles. The Bialowieza Forest\\xa0\\xa0 is the only place where European Bison still\\xa0\\nremain free and living in the forest as they\\xa0\\xa0 once did throughout Europe. Wolves, Lynx, Elk\\xa0\\nand Wild Boar are among its other inhabitants. Number 7. Auschwitz-Birkenau. A visit to Auschwitz-Birkenau is a powerful\\xa0\\nexperience that words can scarcely describe. The\\xa0\\xa0 immense size of the infamous Nazi concentration\\xa0\\ncamp is the first thing to strike visitors\\xa0\\xa0 as they approach the entrance to the memorial and\\xa0\\nmuseum. Devoted to the memory of the murders in\\xa0\\xa0 the camps during World War II, Auschwitz-Birkenau\\xa0\\nhas been visited by more than 25 million people. Number 6. Tatra National Park. Travelers who crave scenic beauty will find it\\xa0\\nin Tatra National Park, located in southcentral\\xa0\\xa0 Poland. Established in 1954, the park is mainly\\xa0\\nforests, meadows and numerous rock formations\\xa0\\xa0 covering the Tatra Mountains. Spelunkers may enjoy\\xa0\\ntouring six of the park’s 650 caves that are open\\xa0\\xa0 to the public. The park also offers several alpine\\xa0\\nlakes as well as a 70 meter-high waterfall. There\\xa0\\xa0 is a similar national park in the neighboring part\\xa0\\nof Slovakia, also called the Tatra National Park. Number 5. Wroclaw. A charming place to visit, Wroclaw’s diverse\\xa0\\ninfluences have resulted in a unique look\\xa0\\xa0 and culture to the city. With Austria,\\xa0\\nBohemia and Prussia all having had an\\xa0\\xa0 impact on the city’s development, the\\xa0\\narchitecture reflects Wroclaw’s past,\\xa0\\xa0 as evidenced by the spectacular market\\xa0\\nsquare. Located on the Odra River,\\xa0\\xa0 the city has a plethora of bridges and\\xa0\\nlovely parks lining its banks, which make\\xa0\\xa0 it a picturesque place to relax – the delightful\\xa0\\nCathedral Island is definitely worth stopping by. Number 4. Gdansk. Once known as Danzig, Gdansk is the largest city\\xa0\\nin northern Poland and its main seaport since\\xa0\\xa0 it lies on the Baltic Sea. Founded around the\\xa0\\n10th century, it has a mixed political history;\\xa0\\xa0 at different times it belonged to Germany and\\xa0\\nPoland, and was a free state before permanently\\xa0\\xa0 becoming a part of Poland after World War II.\\xa0\\nThe city rebuilt itself after the war, restoring\\xa0\\xa0 its Old Town, which is famous for the Royal Road\\xa0\\nthat Polish kings traveled on when visiting this\\xa0\\xa0 historical city. The city also is home to St. Mary\\xa0\\nchurch, the largest brick church in the world. Number 3. Wieliczka Salt Mine. Located on the outskirts of Krakow, the\\xa0\\nWieliczka Salt Mine an incredible place to visit.\\xa0\\xa0 Opened in the 13th century, it was one of\\xa0\\nthe longest and oldest operating salt mines\\xa0\\xa0 until it closed in 2007. The site features an\\xa0\\nunderground city, all carved out of the rock salt,\\xa0\\xa0 including a chapel that is said to have the best\\xa0\\nacoustics of any structure in Europe. Dozens of\\xa0\\xa0 ancient sculptures carved from salt are augmented\\xa0\\nby new sculptures from contemporary artists. Number 2. Warsaw. The Polish capital of Warsaw has had a long,\\xa0\\ncomplex history, often marked by war and conflict.\\xa0\\xa0 It was very much damaged during World War II.\\xa0\\nHowever, it has been lovingly rebuilt to its\\xa0\\xa0 former medieval glory, with brightly colored\\xa0\\ntownhouses making for a pretty – if slightly\\xa0\\xa0 artificial – place to wander around. There’s\\xa0\\na mixed bag of architecture across the city,\\xa0\\xa0 including contemporary cafes and bars to discover.\\xa0\\nThere are plenty of outdoor spaces to enjoy\\xa0\\xa0 and, with a lot of restaurants, it’s\\xa0\\nan excellent destination for foodies. Number 1. Krakow. This southern Polish city, close to the Czech\\xa0\\nRepublic, is a former royal capital. There is\\xa0\\xa0 a beguiling mix of medieval buildings and\\xa0\\nmodern-day, youthful nightlife to soak up\\xa0\\xa0 here. Krakow is known not only for its old town\\xa0\\n– complete with the 13th-century market square,\\xa0\\xa0 which is where you’ll find the iconic\\xa0\\nCloth Hall, the grandiose centerpiece\\xa0\\xa0 of the square. The former Jewish quarter with\\xa0\\nall its synagogues is somber to walk around,\\xa0\\xa0 and many tourists visit Krakow to take a trip to\\xa0\\nAuschwitz – a haunting yet important experience.',\n",

so this is very exciting we have\\xa0\\nchicken carrots and chickpeas and Millie Xanax okay let me try it a little bit and then\\xa0\\nyou see well if it's good I think it's good\\xa0\\xa0 perfect that's a good amount of peppers then we\\xa0\\nactually need to add a bit more so we have to\\xa0\\xa0 keep in mind that the dough itself it's kind\\xa0\\nof tasteless right oh so we kind of have to\\xa0\\xa0 compensate for that by adding more taste salt\\xa0\\nand pepper to the filling itself we think it's\\xa0\\xa0 salty and peppery enough but add more how much\\xa0\\nspicy yeah yeah go for it girl we love peppers [Laughter] [Music] we have rolls out our dough and now we're just\\xa0\\nlike cutting out the little pierogies definitely\\xa0\\xa0 the little dumpling part should have got\\xa0\\nmy nails done so that they look nice for\\xa0\\xa0 my close-ups the flower is covering you know\\xa0\\nyeah just get your fingers all flowered out look at that you guys got your first\\xa0\\nthumbs up okay so now we're rolling\\xa0\\xa0 The Dumpling she said she's going to show\\xa0\\nus multiple ways to roll the dumplings so\\xa0\\xa0 that way we only need to roll them one way\\xa0\\neach dumpling in one way a different way the most grand my way to do it and like\\xa0\\nalso I think the easiest way you said this\\xa0\\xa0 way is the most traditional way or the way your\\xa0\\ngrandma would make it let's see if I can do it\\xa0\\xa0 oh yeah I got it yeah this is\\xa0\\nthe pinch and squeeze method I\\xa0\\xa0 really wanted I really wanted to\\xa0\\nmake an aesthetic cooking video [Music] on the right side so once the water starts to Bubble we start\\xa0\\nto put the dumplings inside then you basically\\xa0\\xa0 need to wait two or three more minutes until they\\xa0\\narrive on the surface when they all float on the\\xa0\\xa0 surface this is a sign for us to start counting\\xa0\\ntwo minutes it is now time to eat the fruits of\\xa0\\xa0 Oliver the dumplings of our labor I think we're\\xa0\\nstarting off with a vegan the vegan kind and this\\xa0\\xa0 is a typical topping to put on it it's fried\\xa0\\nonions fried in super lowly for a long time\\xa0\\xa0 lentils carrots pepper I love how everybody made\\xa0\\nlike a separate dumpling filling and we're all\\xa0\\xa0 trying all of them that's nice right little heart\\xa0\\nand I love the Newton the one made with love these\\xa0\\xa0 are the ones we made this is a mine and Millie's\\xa0\\nbatch and we definitely added a lot of peppery is\\xa0\\xa0 it too salty he told you guys to add

       " \"There's a new military superpower dawning\\non the European continent, and no it's not France, Germany, or even Britain. Poland has decided it's done messing around,\\nand is arming itself to the teeth- but why is Poland apparently preparing itself for\\nWorld War III. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has served as\\nan alarm bell for a Europe that for three decades was content to let the United States\\ndo all its military heavy lifting- while naturally complaining endlessly about US militarization. However, the explosion of war in its backyard\\nhas snapped European powers out of their comfortable post-Cold War victory naps, and suddenly the\\ncontinent has remembered that there's a serious military threat right next door and America\\nis still an entire ocean away. Forget the baguettes and berets, it's time\\nto start buying guns again. But Europe can hardly be blamed for dropping\\nthe ball on their own defense spending. After decades of being prepared to wage an\\napocalyptic battle for global survival, the west breathed a collective sigh of relief\\nand billions of dollars in military spending was re-purposed to civilian projects. Armies were demobilized, budgets slashed,\\nand a lot of military kit was either thrown into deep storage or donated to developing\\ncountries. With the rise of extremism, European militaries\\nfocused on waging small, regional conflicts with logistics handled almost entirely by\\nthe US. The next major war would be won with hugs,\\nor simply not fought at all as Europe tried to bring Russia into the fold by deepening\\ntrade relations with their cranky neighbor. Yet all Europe managed to do was give Russia\\nincredible leverage over them, because Russia wasn't done fighting wars to advance its national\\nagenda. When war broke out in Ukraine, Europe was\\ncaught with its pants down- and despite having a combined GDP many times greater than Russia,\\nthey cannot out-supply Russia inside Ukraine. Poland was quick to take note though, and\\novernight the country went on a dizzying shopping spree for all kinds of new military kit. Poland has good reason to want to buy absolute\\nmountains of new tanks and other gear- and that is not an exaggeration. Had Russia's invasion of Ukraine been planned\\nby anyone more competent, Poland could have found itself at ground zero of a new military\\nstruggle for Europe- and the major European powers could have done little if anything\\nto help the nation. Britain has been in decline as a military\\npower for decades now, with its military shrinking to half of its size at the end of the Cold\\nWar. As an island nation, Britain's most important\\ncapability is its ability to send expeditonary forces abroad, and yet during the wars in\\nIraq and Afghanistan the British military got the nickname of 'the borrowers', for their\\ntendency of bartering for pieces of kit they were missing. Meanwhile their navy has been in significant\\ndecline, with ships having to in effect be mothballed so their crews can be used elsewhere. In 2021 Britain's parliamentary Defense Committee\\ndelivered a scathing report outlying significant problems with the Royal Navy, including a\\ncritical lack of offensive capability and too few surface ships and submarines. Germany is facing its own significant issues. Maintenance problems from a lack of qualified\\ntechnicians as well as spare parts has meant that German pilots aren't getting the number\\nof hours in the cockpit they need to remain proficient. The country is also incapable of meeting NATO's\\nrapid response requirements without cannibalizing other units, leaving it in serious risk of\\nbeing incapable of fighting a protracted conflict. France is about the only European power to\\nmaintain a significant military capability. We actually have little to criticize about\\nFrance, except that its expeditionary capabilities are still slightly lacking- but experience\\ngained in counter-terrorism operations in Africa is helping rectify the problem. We're not picking on Europe unfairly though,\\nthe simple fact is that the continent has been coasting on the back of the US military\\nfor decades. The Royal Navy prioritized retiring logistics\\nvessels as a cost-saving measure- why? Because any conflict they foresaw fighting\\nwould involve the United States and its massive logistics capabilities. Germany retired much of its ground-based air\\ndefenses- why? Because any war it would be involved in would\\nhave assumed air superiority largely thanks to the United States. Since the Cold War ended, Europe evolved into\\na power that would compliment US warfighting abilities, rather than be a battlefield force\\nof its own. Given the fact that Europe's favorite historical\\npastime was mercilessly slaughtering each other for thousands of years though, this\\nmay not have been such a bad thing. Poland has seen which way the wind is blowing,\\nand that it cannot rely on its European allies for national defense. The US military is the most powerful in the\\nworld, but it's also half a planet away, and if history is anything to go by- and it absolutely\\nis if you're Poland- then by the time the US Army arrives in Europe in force, Poland\\nwould already be a battleground. Perhaps no nation in the world is as cursed\\nas Poland, which has historically served as a convenient middle ground for major European\\narmies to batter each other to pieces. That's because the nation has basically no\\ndefensive geographical features, allowing invaders to casually stroll right on in at\\ntheir leisure. Poland is done being Europe's punching bag,\\nand is aiming to field the most capable military inside of Europe. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki spoke\\nto the nation on the eve of its independence day, stating, “The Polish army must be so\\npowerful that it does not have to fight due to its strength alone.” Judging by the amounts of weapon orders it's\\nbeen putting in, this is far more fact than wishful thinking. Poland is raising its defense spending from\\n2.4 percent of their GDP to a whopping 5 percent- this is more than even the United States. It also puts its other NATO partners to shame,\\nwho have largely struggled to meet the bare minimum requirement set by the alliance of\\n2%. This is a long-term commitment too, as the\\ncountry is determined to double the size of its military by 2035, from 150,000 to 300,000. Those troops are going to need combat gear\\nthough, and Poland is buying it in spades. In exchange for sending 240 Soviet-made tanks\\nto Ukraine, the US cut Poland a deal for 250 Abrams, a significant upgrade to its land\\nforces. But the nation was paying very close attention\\nto the fighting in Ukraine, and made a direct bid to Lockheed Martin to buy around 500 HIMARS\\nunits. This was an incredible order, and would have\\nmade Poland as big an operator of HIMARs as the United States. Unfortunately the US was itself procuring\\nunits to replace those sent to Ukraine and to make even more available to the country. Given that the war in Ukraine has been basically\\none giant commercial for Lockheed Martin, it's no surprise that other nations were already\\nin line to buy the vaunted guided rocket artillery- with even the US wishing to beef up its own\\nnumbers. With the US in effect sold out for the forseeable\\nfuture, Poland turned to South Korea for its guided rocket artillery need, signing an order\\nfor 288 Chunmoo platforms (https://frontierindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/K239-Chunmoo-rocket-launcher.webp?ezimgfmt=ng%3Awebp%2Fngcb1). Similar to HIMARS only beefier, the Chunmoo\\ncan carry twice as many rockets as HIMARS- though at the cost of mobility. With a significant standing army in the works\\nthough, Poland believes the trade off is worth it- its rocket artillery will have to do less\\nhiding thanks to major investments in other areas of its military. This includes the air force, with Poland signing\\nan agreement to buy 32 F-35s. But Poland shocked the world when it once\\nmore returned to South Korea for multiple military purchases- in effect, sourcing almost\\nall of its new purchases from the nation. Purchases include a fleet of 48 FA-50s. These are meant to replace its aging fleet\\nof Migs, and will compliment its inventory of F-16s and soon, F-35s. While Poland won't have a major air force\\nanytime soon, it's well on its way to being a significant threat to Russia should it ever\\nmake the mistake of crossing into its air space. Beefing up its traditional tube artillery,\\nPoland is also buying 648 K9 howitzers from South Korea. This will make Poland one of, if not the biggest\\nartillery power in Europe aside from Russia- especially when coupled with its purchase\\nof 288 Chunmoo MLRS. By far the highest profile item on Poland's\\nshopping list though, and one that has really annoyed its neighbors, is the purchase of\\nnearly one thousand K2 main battle tanks. The K2 was indigenously designed by South\\nKorea, and is believed to be a highly capable modern tank. Its real capabilities are unknown though,\\nas the tank has never seen combat and the South Korean government isn't in a hurry to\\nmake classified data public. Most observers however have full confidence\\nin the K2, though Russian defense analysts are puzzled by the design decision to not\\nhave the tank launch its crew into orbit upon taking a hit from an anti-tank missile. The main concern raised by Poland's purchase\\nhowever is that the K2 was specifically built for a war South Korea expected to fight on\\nits relatively hilly terrain- a far cry from the flat European plain. How the K2 will fare here is anyone's guess,\\nand hopefully we'll never have to find out. Poland's South Korean spending spree has made\\nthe two countries absolutely chummy, and that's something that's really annoyed the rest of\\nEurope. Home to many great tank manufacturers, Europe\\nis frankly puzzled at Poland's decision to purchase tanks from a nation half a world\\naway, specially when its logistics will depend on easily disrupted supply routes that literally\\nspan the planet. But the decision makes a lot of sense if South\\nKorea plans to break into the global arms market, and if the nation builds maintenance\\nfacilities inside of Poland itself. This will secure Poland's logistics needs\\nand open the door to the European arms market for South Korea, a deal that benefits both\\nsides. Germany has famously been the United States'\\nmost important European ally, but now Germany has become nothing more than a logistics hub\\nfor the American military. With the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, Poland\\nhas now become America's most important European ally, and the relationship was cemented by\\nUS officials commenting on the fact. Perhaps unsurprising given its proximity to\\nRussia, Poland was the loudest voice calling for Europe to aid Ukraine, and threw its doors\\nopen to Ukrainian refugees. Its air fields and transport networks were\\nimmediately made available to US and other foreign aid flowing into Ukraine, and when\\na Ukrainian air defense missile landed in Poland and killed several people, the nation\\nput the blame squarely on Russia for necessitating the launch of air defenses by Ukraine in the\\nfirst place. Given Poland's history and tenuous strategic\\nposition in Europe, it's no surprise that it's incredibly invested in the outcome of\\nthe war in Ukraine. What is surprising however is the incredible\\nspeed with which the country has moved to bolster its defenses, and the willingness\\nto work with the United States to arm Ukraine. Given its position inside of Europe, and the\\nmilitary capabilities it will soon field, it's easy to see why Poland will soon trump\\nthe rest of the European powers as America's most important ally in the region. What remains to be seen however is if the\\nnation will go through with all of its planned purchases- especially if the war in Ukraine\\nends sooner than expected and the Polish population grows weary of the incredible price tags some\\nof these weapons come with.

       " \"[Corey] Nestled away at\\nthe crossroads of Europe lies a place that is quickly becoming the\\nnewest hotbed for innovation. (dramatic, inspiring music) It's a place that knows\\nhow to take action. One that moves quickly and\\ncourageously in the face of challenges, daring to seize the moment where others might play it safe. A place where the entrepreneurial\\nmentality reigns supreme. This is Poland, a dynamic\\nland with a lot to teach us about the transformative potential of embracing change, reinvention,\\nand creating opportunity. [Tanya] I left for\\nPoland by war in Ukraine. [Corey] Here we'll\\nexplore the powerful wins of innovation that have converged with the local customs, values, and ways of living to\\ncreate something unique. [Wojciech] We are not afraid to test, we are not afraid to speed up. [Corey] Together, we'll see firsthand how technology and tradition combine\\nto form Cloud Cultures. (inspiring music) [Corey] I'm Corey Sanders. I'm an engineer who\\nloves to build, innovate, and explore the new\\nfrontiers of technology. In my time at Microsoft, I've seen a lot of innovation happen. I've seen plenty of good ideas fail and mediocre ones find ways to succeed. And I've realized innovation isn't as much about the idea as it is\\nthe people behind it. Which is why I'm so excited to head out on this trip across\\nEurope to meet and learn from the people and the\\ncompanies driving our future. First stop, Warsaw. There's a fearlessness to what\\nI'm seeing come out of there. When it comes time to act, Polish people jump right in, courageously taking on new challenges, identifying opportunities,\\nbuilding fast, embracing risk, and doing it all in a way\\nunlike anything I've ever seen. To get a better understanding, I connected with my colleague Marta Gasik. Hey Marta, how are you? [Marta] Hey, Corey. A data center lead and business strategy\\nmanager based in Warsaw, someone deeply familiar with\\nthe country, the culture, and the companies- like CCC Group, one of Poland's most\\npopular shoe retailers who went all in during the pandemic, using the lockdown and the\\ncloud to reinvent themselves. [Marta] Well, Wojciech, thank you so much for finding time to meet with us today. Personally, I've been a customer at least my whole adult\\nlife, possibly a bit longer. But maybe you could start by introducing us a bit\\nabout the CCC Group. [Wojciech] The CCC Group\\nis a fashion tech company. Basically, we started with\\nthe brick-and-mortar business more than 10 years ago, and\\nthen the company evolved. So, we have similar businesses in 28 countries, and we are speeding up. [Marta] The CCC I remember\\nfrom few years back was truly, as you said, brick and mortar. How do you leap so much into the innovation in such a short time? [Wojciech] Well, basically,\\nthis is within our DNA. The COVID times was very\\nspecific for the retail industry. So, the day when this store was closed, the day afterwards, we\\nlaunched more than 50 projects. We knew that we had to try\\nto find some alternatives. So our initial vision was to land within the full omnichannel space. So we started this journey four years ago so that the courage, the\\ntechnology, the willingness, and the team play that\\ndrove us where we are today. [Marta] Sorry, you said four years? Like, four years entire\\nomnichannel journey. Like, it takes much longer from my experience on some other markets. [Wojciech] Well, basically\\nwe started with the enablers. And the key enabler is agility. We invested in the cloud foundations on the very beginning of this journey, so we've been quite fast\\nwithin our strategy. We are saying widely and openly that we would like to be\\nlike a data-driven company, not just in the customer domain, but we really now invest\\nand work a lot when it comes to the supply chain, when\\nit comes to the marketing. It's all about the data literacy, how fast the organization\\nis able to digest and to use the results. [Marta] And I think there's\\nsomething about Poland, just about our history, about the way we like to spin things off. [Wojciech] Yeah, because\\nwe are not afraid to test, we are not afraid to speed up. If I were to say what is the characteristic of the typical company within this region, is the courage. We don't give up. [Marta] I'm looking forward to being a customer of your\\nomnichannel 2.0 with CCC Group. Thank you so much for sharing\\nthe experience with us today. (Marta and Wojciech speaking Polish) (inspiring music) [Corey] It's amazing how bold moves and powerful tech can transform a company in such a short amount of time. And the impact it can have on people's lives is even greater. Something I want to learn\\nmore about from Tanya, a Ukrainian refugee enrolled\\nin the CYBER Trainees program, a nonprofit providing Polish and Ukrainian women with\\nlife-changing opportunities. We've got some pierogies here. (Corey and Tanya laugh) [Corey] Well, thank you so much\\nfor making the time to meet with me. So what brought\\nyou originally to Poland? [Tanya] I left for\\nPoland by war in Ukraine. I live in big city in Ukraine, in Kiev, because big city\\nopens up big opportunities. [Corey] You said you have a son. How old is your son? [Tanya] Six. [Corey] Six, okay. My daughter's three. Tell me a little bit\\nabout what it was like growing up in Ukraine before the war. [Translator] I was born in\\nUkraine in the Dnipro region. I went to school there, and when I finished\\nschool, I moved to Kiev. I studied management\\nat a university there, and after I graduated, I got\\nmarried and started working for a Ukrainian\\ntelecommunications company, gave birth to a son, I started a new job, and\\nthen the war started, and I left Ukraine. [Corey] Must have been tough to move. [Tanya] M-hmm, yeah. [Corey] You know, here in Poland, what are some of the things about the culture here or the\\npeople here that you noticed? [Tanya] I impressed for culture,\\ntradition, and language. [Corey] Felt like a home away from home? [Tanya] Yeah, yeah. [Corey] So you got involved\\nwith the CYBER Trainees program. Could you tell me a little bit about it? It's a program for Ukrainian and Polish women who find work in IT. As part of the program, you know, what was the most enjoyable part? What did you really like about it? I'm attracted to cybersecurity. Oh, fantastic. Okay, and why cybersecurity? [Translator] I think that\\nnowadays, especially, it's very important to have some idea of what is true and what is not. Because today, there are\\nall kinds of disinformation, (Tanya speaking Ukrainian) and we have to somehow discern it for ourselves to feel more secure, and not subject ourselves\\nto some kind of danger. (Tanya speaking Ukrainian) [Corey] So, I mean, so impactful,\\ncyber security launched at Microsoft really focused\\non keeping customers safe and making sure that they're protected. And so, I love that that's\\nthe focus that you have. It's such an important part of IT. What would you say some of the experiences of some of the other women\\nhas been in the program? [Translator] Our group was the best. We supported each other. We became friends. We still keep in touch and share our experiences and thoughts. We are very happy that there\\nwas this opportunity for us, for Ukrainian women to take part in this program, because it\\ngave us a chance to move on. (Tanya speaking Ukrainian) [Corey] I mean, I'm just,\\nI'm so humbled to hear about the steps you've\\ntaken, and I'm so impressed by how you're taking technology\\nto create empowerment to be able to change your life. When you look forward, what are the dreams that you have for you and for your son? (Tanya speaking Ukrainian) [Translator] The knowledge that I received during that project\\nmakes me more confident about the future. (Tanya speaking Ukrainian) I lost my job in Ukraine, and now I have a chance to take my career in a different direction. So, we are happy that we\\ntook part in this program. (Tanya speaking Ukrainian) [Corey] I would just say,\\nyou're an inspiration and a role model, obviously for your\\nson, but also for many of us, and I'm honored to get\\nthe chance to meet you and hear about your story. It's been wonderful. [Tanya] Thank you. [Corey] Tanya's story is a great reminder that technology alone\\ndoesn't drive change. True change comes from\\nthe people who use it as a tool to create a better future. On the other side of town, Marta's meeting with a local bank that is\\ndisrupting the financial industry by embracing mistakes and\\nbuilding a culture of empowerment. [Marta] Karolina, thank you\\nso much for having us today. And I must say, my personal\\nexperience coming back to Poland after a few years living\\nabroad, I genuinely felt like I lept forward in time. The financial service\\nindustry is so advanced, and Nest Bank is one of the best examples. [Karolina] And thank you for\\nsuch nice brief about us. Nest is a group, bank,\\nand factoring company. We focus on digital services. Our key market segment are small, and micro-enterprise\\nowners focus on solutions which save on time and\\nmake their life easier. Therefore, all our services are around simple, usually innovative, but, most importantly, simple\\nand secure payment methods. [Marta] Is there any specific\\npart of your organization that is an innovation hub, or is innovation happening equally across all business divisions? [Karolina] Innovation happens equally. This is very close cooperation\\nof Customer Experience team, of Product team, of risk. On one hand, you need\\nthe highest standards in terms of responsibility, security, but on the other hand, this is what customers would\\nlike to happen, seamless, as easy as possible. And obviously the technology\\nwill then make things happen. Like, we have implemented onboarding, on the cloud, and mobile\\nonboarding using selfie. [Marta] I've seen a selfie. You can open the bank\\naccount any time, really, without any interaction. [Karolina] We say it\\ntakes 10 minutes, however, on average, now we can see that customers do it in much less time. [Marta] I love it. I mean, that's the first\\ntime I've ever seen any institution do\\nonboarding with a selfie. We talk about innovations, reinventing processes in\\nbanking and interactions. That would require a\\nlot of changes, right? How do you build change\\ninto your company's culture? [Karolina] First of all, we focus to attract the\\npeople who are open-minded and open to changes. Definitely cloud is the technology which attracts talented people to Nest. This really happens. People would like to\\nlearn the new services. It's easier for them to\\ninvest time in innovation. When we have infrastructure\\nmanagement automatized, it is attracting good people. But when you need to create the culture, you need to allow people to make mistakes. We have the strong need\\nto go in the unknown, to reinvent, to try again, to challenge the status quo, because maybe our nature, definitely this is great\\nbenefit to have such people on board with such mindset. [Marta] Karolina, thank\\nyou for having us here. (Marta and Karolina speaking Polish) [Corey] After three\\neye-opening conversations, it's time Marta and I\\nregroup to share stories. And the location of our meeting\\ncouldn't be more fitting: the new Microsoft datacenter here in the Polish Digital Valley. So, this is a unique\\ndatacenter that we built here? [Marta] Yeah, actually in Poland Central, we have for the first time in any of our datacenters\\nworldwide, this new design. So, this specific one is called\\nRapid Deployment Datacenter. We use more prefabricated,\\npreassembled components. [Corey] I see. Now we've rounded the corner, and we've got these giant\\nspaceship-looking things here. So what are these? [Marta] Those are actually\\nour water-retention tanks. [Corey] Ah. [Marta] Talking of innovation, you know, we actually optimize\\nour datacenters to work in much higher temperatures\\nthan the industry average, which allows us to spend less energy, use less energy, on cooling\\nand adiabatic cooling, for example, is one of the technologies-adiabatic. [Corey] Adiabatic, okay. [Marta] Adiabatic cooling. [Corey] I think I got it. Now, we got a lot of time talking about how cool the datacenter is. But tell me, like, what\\ndoes it mean to you, what does it mean to Poland, to have this\\nregion deployed here? [Marta] Oh, we're very passionate about the changes we can bring. Now, on some industries, it's not always that easy\\nto go to public cloud, and there is some preference\\nsometimes for data residency so, now we are making\\nthe cloud accessible. [Corey] So I understand you\\nmoved back as part of these plans. Like, what's really exciting for you about this launch? [Marta] Yeah, I've been with Microsoft on some other of our EMEA markets, and then, you know, coming home\\nfor Christmas, just popping by the office and listening\\nto the leadership team here talk about the vision for Polish Digital Valley,\\nfor our entire ecosystem here, how we can innovate, how we can change, how we can partner with\\nthem for the future. I just wanted to be part of that. [Corey] That's awesome. Just the ability to innovate and be here with this type\\nof deployment to do that. You ended up talking to\\na few customers, right? [Marta] I had a great\\nopportunity to have conversations with CCC and with Nest Bank. CCC, really interesting angle\\non how our political history, the geopolitical history of Poland, forces Polish\\npeople to innovate faster and to go for the process of change much quicker than\\nsome other Western markets. One of the other customers we met with this week was Nest Bank. So Nest Bank is a Polish\\nbank that's digital first, and we talked about how the\\nchoice to go cloud first few years back allowed them\\nto change how they innovate, how they better meet their customer needs, and how they quickened the time to market. [Corey] That's fantastic. [Marta] You've also had a chance to meet with, I believe, Tanya, right? [Corey] I met with Tanya, yeah. Very moving, really powerful story about her leaving Ukraine\\nand coming to Poland and joining the CYBER Trainees program, and the opportunity for her to empower herself\\nto build these skills and support herself and\\nher son in this new world. It was just, it was touching. I was very moved by her story. [Marta] Just constantly\\nreinventing yourself and going forward. Digital transformation\\nshould not exclude anyone. [Corey] And exactly, I\\nmean, certainly having the infrastructure is\\nimportant, but having the skills and the community, and then\\nthat drive for innovation, which of course, we've seen\\nin Poland, a whole lot of. [Marta] We're just giving tools to all of the hundreds and thousands of people who have the ideas for innovation. [Corey] Well, thank you, Marta, this has been really fantastic to talk. Even in the cold, snow weather here, it's been truly wonderful. [Marta] Thank you, Corey. We're so excited you had\\nthe time to meet with us and see what Polish Digital Valley will really become in the next years. (dramatic, inspiring music) [Corey] As my journey through\\nPoland comes to a close, I'm struck by how much I've learned. I came with certain expectations, but what I discovered here has left me with a new way of\\nthinking about innovation. The cloud culture here is\\nquick, vibrant, and determined, filled with innovators who are focused on solving real problems and challenges. I leave here feeling energized and excited about the possibilities\\nof what we can all achieve with just a little bit of boldness. I'm ready to dive in to my next adventure. (upbeat music) [Man] I think it's in our DNA,\\nof Swedish people, to build. The Swedes, when they start a company, from day one, are building\\nit to grow outside of Sweden. [Corey] See you in Sweden.\",\n",
       " \"HERE, THAT'S ALL TO COME. LOTS TO GET TO. NOW, BECAUSE OF THE INTENSE FOCUS ON THE ISRAEL-GAZA WAR IN AMERICAN NEWS, OVER THE WEEKEND AND IN TODAY'S NEWS, YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN, MIGHT NOT HAVE SEEN SOME BIG NEWS IN POLITICS IN EUROPE. A COUNTRY THAT HAD BEEN FLIRTING WITH THE PROSPECT OF MAYBE GIVING UP THEIR DEMOCRACY, MAYBE HEADING TOWARD A MORE AUTHORITARIAN FORM OF GOVERNMENT, SOMETHING MORE LIKE HUNGARY OR EVEN RUSSIA, HAS DECIDED NOT TO GO THAT WAY. IN POLAND THIS WEEKEND, THE POLISH PEOPLE TURNED OUT IN HUGE, HUGE NUMBERS. OVER 74% VOTER TURNOUT IN POLAND. THAT'S A BIGGER TURNOUT THAN WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY THEIR MOST ELECTION EVER WHEN THEY VOTED OUT THE COMMUNIST PARTY IN 1989. THE POLISH PEOPLE TURNED OUT THIS WEEKEND IN UNPRECEDENTEDLY GIGANTIC NUMBERS, AND THEY VOTED OUT THE HARD RIGHT PARTY THAT HAD BEEN THE GOVERNING PARTY THERE. THE SO-CALLED LAW AND JUSTICE PARTY. AND SO IT'S JUST, WHETHER OR NOT YOU CARE ABOUT POLAND ITSELF AND ITS FUTURE, IT'S AN IMPORTANT THING FOR EUROPE. IT'S AN IMPORTANT THING FOR PARTICULARLY, SAY, THE EUROPEAN UNION'S SUPPORT OF UKRAINE IN RUSSIA'S WAR ON UKRAINE. BUT IT ALSO HELPS US GET OUR ARMS AROUND THIS LARGER INTERNATIONAL PROJECT THAT EVEN WE IN OUR COUNTRY ARE SUBJECT TO RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE SEEN AUTHORITARIAN ANTIDEMOCRATIC MOVEMENTS AND LEADERS RISE ALL OVER THE WORLD IN RECENT YEARS, INCLUDING HERE AT HOME. BUT THERE HAS BEEN ELECTORAL PUSHBACK. SOME NOTABLE ELECTORAL PUSHBACK IN IMPORTANT COUNTRIES. WE HAVE SEEN, FOR EXAMPLE, DONALD TRUMP VOTED OUT OF OFFICE IN THIS COUNTRY. RESOUNDINGLY IN THE UNITED STATES. 2020. WE SAW IN BRAZIL, VOTED OUT OF POWER. RESOUNDINGLY IN 2022. EARLIER THIS YEAR IN SPAIN, WE SAW THE HARD-RIGHT PARTY THERE REJECTED UNEXPECTEDLY BY VOTERS. NOW THIS WEEKEND WE HAVE JUST SEEN POLAND'S VERY HARD RIGHT LAW AND JUSTICE PARTY VOTED OUT. AND IT DOESN'T MAY NOT THERE ISN'T STILL RISING AUTHORITARIANISM AROUND THE WORLD BUT IT DOES MEAN IN INSTANCES LIKE THESE, IN BIG IMPORTANT COUNTRIES WITH MATURE DEMOCRACIES, WE ARE SEEING BIG VOTER PUSHBACK AGAINST TRUMP-TIME OR VICTOR LEADERS. WOULD BE AUTHORITARIANS DON'T GENERALLY TAKE WELL TO ELECTIONS VOTING THEM OUT OF OFFICE. THAT'S WHY THEY TRY TO UNDERMINE DEMOCRACY, FULL STOP. IN THE CASE OF JUMP AND JAIR BOLSONARO, WE SAW THEIR SUPPORTERS STORMING THE CAPITOL TO TRY TO KEEP THEM IN POWER AFTER THEY LOST ELECTION. SO EYES ARE ON POLAND NOW FOR ANY KIND OF POTENTIAL EVENTUALITY LIKE THAT, OR RULE BY FORCE SHENANIGANS TO TRY TO\",\n",

UKRAINE IS CRITICAL IN MAKING SURE THAT HAPPENS. >> PRESIDENT BIDEN SPEAKING LAST NIGHT ON \"60 MINUTES\" ABOUT THE WARS IN ISRAEL AND UKRAINE. >>> SBARLINTERNATIONAL SUPPORT F UKRAINE LIKELY GOT A BOOST YESTERDAY WITH POLAND\\'S CENTRIST AND PROGRESSIVE PARTIES APPEARING TO HAVE WON ENOUGH VOTES IN THE WEEKEND ELECTIONS TO FORM A COALITION GOVERNMENT AND OUST THE COUNTRY\\'S CURRENT NATIONALIST RULING PARTY. THE ELECTION DREW OVER 70% OF VOTERS TO THE POLLS, WHICH IS THE HIGHEST TURNOUT IN POLAND SINCE THE END OF COMMUNIST RULE BACK IN 1989. JOINING US NOW, U.S. NATIONAL EDITOR AT \"THE FINANCIAL TIMES,\" ED LUCE. AND STAFF WRITER AT THE\"THE ATLANTIC,\" ANNE APPLEBAUM. GOOD TO HAVE YOU BOTH THIS MORNING. >> ANNE, LET\\'S BEGIN WITH YOU. THE EXIT POLLS SUGGEST A WINNER FOR THE CENTRIST PARTIES BUT, OF COURSE, THE VOTES STILL BEING COUNTED. THE VOTES NOW DO SEEM TO BE LINING UP WITH THOSE EXIT POLLS. BUT EXPLAIN, IF YOU COULD, FOR PEOPLE WATCHING WHY THIS ELECTION WAS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT EUROPEAN ELECTIONS OVER THE PAST DECADE. >> SO IN POLAND, WE\\'VE HAD FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS A NATIONALIST CONSERVATIVE RULING PARTY THAT WAS ESSENTIALLY TRYING TO CHANGE THE RULES OF POLISH DEMOCRACY, CHANGE THE LEGAL SYSTEM, CHANGE THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM, CHANGE THE RULES OF ELECTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WOULD NEVER LOSE, ESSENTIALLY. THEY TURNED STATE MEDIA, WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT HERE, INTO A PROPAGANDA TUBE, SPITTING OUT THIS VERY NEGATIVE, HARSH, ANGRY SMEAR CAMPAIGNS AGAINST THE DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION. SO THE FACT THAT A GROUP OF THREE POLISH PARTIES, CENTER, CENTER LEFT, CENTER RIGHT, MANAGED TO WIN A MAJORITY AGAINST THIS KIND OF AUTOCRATIC POPULIST YUOU POPULIST LANGUAGE IMPORTANT FOR OTHER PARTIES IN EUROPE WHO WILL BE FIGHTING IMPORTANT ELECTIONS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. YOU KNOW, JUST BECAUSE AUTOCRATIC POPULISTS WIN DOESN\\'T MEAN THEY WIN FOREVER. THEY CAN BE DEFEATED, AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT SIGN. REGARDING THE WAR IN UKRAINE, IT MATTERS BECAUSE THE RULING PARTY, IN A BID TO WIN OVER A KIND OF FRINGE NATIONALIST VOTE, IT BEGAN USING ANTI-UKRAINIAN LANGUAGE, VERY NEGATIVE LANGUAGE ABOUT UKRAINE OVER THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS, DESPITE HAVING SUPPORTED THEM PRIOR TO THAT. A NEW COALITION, LED BY THE CENTRIST OPPOSITION, WILL REALIGN ITSELF WITH UKRAINE AND CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR UKRAINE, AND I HOPE, EVENTUALLY, HELP BRING UKRAINE INTO EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS. >> ED, THERE HAS BEEN A BATTLE IN THE MIDDLE OF EUROPE FOR SOME TIME NOW, LED BY ORBAN AND HUNGARY HUNGARY. THERE HAS BEEN A BATTLE BETWEEN AUTOCRATIC POPULISM AND WESTERN DEMOCRACY. ANYBODY THAT DOESN\\'T BELIEVE THAT, JUST LISTEN TO WHAT ORBAN HIMSELF HAS SAID. HE HATES LIBERAL DEMOCRACY. HE CALLS HIMSELF AN ILLIBERAL DEMOCRACY, CALLS HUNGARY AN ILLIBERAL DEMOCRACY. POLAND, OBVIOUSLY, SO MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT FOR SO MANY MORE REASONS. TALK ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT THIS ELECTION IS AND IF, IN FACT, TUSK ENDS UP RUNNING THE COUNTRY, WHAT THAT MEANS FOR WESTERN DEMOCRACY. I DON\\'T MEAN TO OVERSTATE IT, BUT I DON\\'T THINK I CAN OVERSTATE IT. >> NO, YOU\\'RE NOT OVERSTATING IT. I MEAN, POLAND IS, BY FAR, THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE FORMER EASTERN BLOC COUNTRIES. IT\\'S THE LARGEST. IT IS FOUR TIMES THE SIZE OF HUNGARY. IF THE LAW AND JUSTICE PARTY HAD BEEN RE-ELECTED, AS ANNE POINTED OUT, IF THEY\\'D BEEN RE-ELECTED, THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN PROBABLY THE LAST RELATIVELY FREE AND FAIR ELECTION IN POLAND\\'S DEMOCRATIC HISTORY. I FITHINK THAT\\'S WHY YOU\\'VE HAD SURGE IN TURNOUT. THE POLISH VOTERS REALIZED WHAT WAS AT STAKE. THIS WAS THE ORBAN MOMENT. THEY\\'VE CLOSED DOWN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARIES, SNUFFED OUT INDEPENDENT MEDIA, USED STATE COMPANIES TO BROADCAST LAW AND JUSTICE PROPAGANDA. IT WAS NOT A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. THE FACT THAT THE OPPOSITION PARTIES COULD HAVE WON ON A PLAYING FIELD VERY STEEPLY TILTED AGAINST THEM SHOWS JUST HOW MUCH THE POLISH ELECTORATE REALIZES WHAT WAS AT STAKE. THIS, I THINK, ISN\\'T JUST A BIG MOMENT FOR POLAND. IT IS A HUGE MOMENT FOR POLAND. IT IS A HUGE MOMENT FOR EUROPE, AS WELL. EUROPE HAS BEEN WITHHOLDING BILLIONS AND BILLIONS, 35 BILLION EUROS OF AID TO POLAND BECAUSE IT\\'S BEEN BREAKING ALL THE RULES OF THE CLUB BY PACKING THE COURTS, BY CLOSING DOWN INDEPENDENT MEDIA. THAT MONEY WILL NOW BE, ONCE A NEW GOVERNMENT IS IN PLACE UNDER DONALD TURSK, WHICH LOOKS LIKE WILL HAPPEN, THAT MONEY WILL BE RELEASED.

       " \"Polish President Andre Duda, thank you\\nso much for joining Bloomberg Television.\\nYour relationship with Vladimir Zelensky, who's also here for the UN\\nGeneral Assembly, has been one of a friendship, a very warm relationship,\\nespecially at the start of the war. This war has elevated you to really a\\nglobal statesman. You were this conduit between Kiev and\\nall these Western leaders that wanted to get into Ukraine and have access to\\nZelensky. But lately, we've seen some friction\\nbetween this relationship, whether it's the grain issues transporting through\\nPoland, as well as the debate within your government about financial aid to\\nUkrainian refugees that are in Poland as Wolinski comes to United Nations and\\nhe's really begging the international community to still stand with Kiev and\\nthat international support. Will he continue to have your support,\\nPoland Support, and at what cost to your own people?\\nWell, indeed it has been. It is the case that right from the\\nbeginning of this war, this sense of this full scale Russian aggression\\nagainst Ukraine since the 24th of February 2022, total Polish policy.\\nIt is Poland and the Polish people, maybe some of whom are those in the\\nclosest neighborhood, have been helping most to Ukraine and to the Ukrainian\\npeople, because it was us who, right from the start decided to open our\\nborder and to take in millions of refugees from Ukraine.\\nIn total, we had several million people coming through Poland.\\n2 million Ukrainians are still in our country.\\nBut first and foremost, right from the start, we started to send armaments to\\nUkraine. We have supplied more than 300 tanks to\\nUkraine. We have also supplied almost all our MiG\\n29 jets, which we had. We sent more than 100 are motor vehicles\\nsupplied state of the art howitzers , which we produce in Poland.\\nWe also delivered we delivered a huge number of armaments and we have been\\nhelping Ukraine all the time. This is also help which is given by\\nordinary people in Poland who have taken Ukrainian refugees into their homes.\\nAnd we believed, and we still believe that it is necessary and we try to serve\\nas neighbors should do, those who help their neighbor, their brother, who is in\\na difficult situation. So this is the situation that we have.\\nWe understand it perfectly well. We try to do that.\\nBut this is a war. And, you know, there are different\\nsituations, difficult situations in a war, know in a war.\\nAlso, normal life goes on as the one we have in our country.\\nThere are different situations, difficult ones.\\nThat is simple. But back to this green deal, where\\nthere's a lot of friction at the moment. You said today that there will be a\\nlegal solution at the WTO, but then you also said that it will be, quote, good\\nif Ukraine would remember that it does receive assistance from Poland.\\nAnd then you said that Ukraine should note it is a transit country, Poland.\\nIs that a threat to Zelensky? Yeah, it's on.\\nYou know, this is not the point to lead any kind of discussion in the media.\\nPersonally, I regret that there is a discussion going on in the media.\\nI will try to cut it off for sure, because somebody has to be wiser here\\nand the situation is not easy. Let me say one thing.\\nWe try to help Ukraine. We have created transport corridors,\\ntransit corridors precisely to transit Ukraine in green through Poland\\nto in the direction of seaport, be it Polish seaports or the seaports in the\\nBaltic states, to make sure that the Ukrainian grain can be exported wherever\\nit is needed, because we have got our own agriculture production in Poland.\\nAnd when Ukraine started selling its grain in Poland in a completely\\nuncontrolled way in autumn last year, when it turned out that suddenly we had\\na flood of rain both on our territory, Polish farmers started to protest\\nbecause it really hit a Polish agricultural production.\\nAnd we also need to protect our own market.\\nWe also have our own citizens and we have to care for their interests.\\nWe want to help Ukraine. We transit.\\nWe have a set of transport corridors. Right now there are more than two times\\nthe volume of the grain which goes through Poland is two times as high as\\nit was in the beginning of 2023. We cannot allow ourselves that there is\\nUkrainian grain sold without any control in the Polish market, the grain which is\\nmuch cheaper, which is not up to all the European Union norms and to all the\\nstandards of the EU. And this is a gigantic, huge production\\nin a way I do understand it. It's easiest to sell it in grain in\\nPoland because we are close and the transportation costs are not big.\\nBut Poland has got its own interests as well.\\nWe also have our own citizens and we have to care for their interests.\\nWe need to take care of them and. A pity that our Ukrainian neighbors did\\nnot want a President Zelensky saying on Twitter.\\nHe said today, Alarmingly, some in Europe play out solidarity in a\\npolitical theater turning green into a thriller.\\nHe's not naming you by name, but clearly you guys are having a public spat.\\nWill there be a retaliatory measure from Poland this time this year?\\nWe are trying to create, as I said, the best possible conditions to make sure\\nthat Ukrainian grain can be transported to Poland.\\nLet me also draw attention to the fact that a problem is not only the problem.\\nIndymedia is being made out of this whole issue by our Ukrainian neighbors.\\nWe are not the ones who are creating a problem.\\nWe try to help them as much as we can. But it is just normal that every\\nauthority has to take care of their citizens.\\nWe are also democratically elected Polish authorities who were elected in\\nelections, and it is our duty to care for the interests of our voters.\\nI believe that here in the United States, not only all politicians, but\\nalso all citizens who cast their votes in the elections of the Congress in\\nlocal elections and presidential elections understand it perfectly well.\\nThis is what they also expect from their politicians.\\nThis is what they expect from the American president that he will care\\nfirst and foremost for American interests.\\nIt is my duty to take care, especially of Polish interests and the interest of\\nour citizens and compatriots, my fellow citizens.\\nThis is what we are trying to do. We do have a problem\\ncaused by Russia because it is Russia who is responsible for unleashing the\\nwar in Ukraine. It was Russia who invaded Ukraine and it\\nis Russia actually who is to be blamed for all these problems.\\nWe need to solve them somehow. We can only make an appeal to stop\\nattacks attacking us in the media. We really try to do a lot to support our\\nUkrainian neighbors. And we have sacrificed a lot.\\nWe have given a lot in order to help Ukraine.\\nAnd we want to assist Ukraine because we understand what it means to be placed\\nunder Russian aggression. But we also need to protect our\\ncitizens. And this is our fundamental one.\\nWhen you're talking about protecting your citizens, you have an election next\\nmonth in Poland. And right now the far right call it\\nconfederation is gaining in the polls. Is there a concern that in your society\\nthere is fatigue about aiding Ukraine and fatigue about the support that\\nPoland is giving to give the borders of Polish?\\nThe election is coming in Poland.\\nIt is parliamentary election, however. But in my second term as president of\\nPoland, I do not run in these elections. I just observe them.\\nI also follow the campaign, which is ongoing.\\nHowever, it is a fact that the war in Ukraine, the one started by Russia, its\\nfull scale attack more than a year and a half ago, has been going on for a very\\nlong time. As I said, a few million Ukrainian\\ncitizens lived in our country. About 2 million still live there.\\nThey are among us. And there are many different problems\\nand also people to people problems. And because of that, of course, there is\\na phenomenon of a certain fatigue. It is just normal.\\nIt is just human. Polish people have sacrificed a lot to\\nhelp their neighbors from Ukraine. Having said that, the situations among\\npeople are different. There are various killings and of\\ncourse, it is also the circumstance of the case that there are some political\\ngroups who play out those emotions in a very straightforward way.\\nPlease remember we are a direct neighbour to Russia and it is in the\\ninterests of Russia to influence the elections in Poland.\\nIt is in their interest to decrease the support for Ukraine and decrease the\\nsupport that the Poles give to Ukraine so that Poland is not send Ukraine.\\nThis is in that Russian interest today. So everybody attacks Poland today.\\nEveryone who instead of sitting at the table and talking to\\nPolish authorities, they really support Russia.\\nThat debate is also playing out whether or not to send more aid to Ukraine in\\nthe United States right now, in Washington, in Congress, if there's no\\nbreakthrough from Ukraine on the counter offensive, do you think the global\\nsupport will wane? Will you go to Virginia?\\nFrom my point of view, one thing is at hand Amanda Lang partners.\\nInternational law has to be respected. In other words, the primacy of\\ninternational law has to be restored. And one of the fundamental principles of\\ninternational law is respect for internationally recognized waters.\\nWe need to bring about a situation where Russia withdraws from the occupied\\nUkrainian territories. In a nutshell,\\nit is important that Ukraine regains control of its international borders.\\nLet me put it this way This will mean the victory of Ukraine and the victory\\nof the free world. Precisely this.\\nIt is not about defeating Russia. Thanksgiving is not about, let's say,\\nforeign troops entering the territory of Russia.\\nNo, absolutely not. We do not want it whatsoever.\\nWhat we want is to make sure that Ukrainian troops\\nare effective in dealing with the Russian aggressors so that Ukraine can\\nregain the territories that Russia robbed from it.\\nWhen that happens, we will be able to say that the primacy of international\\nlaw has been restored. And this is, of course, a chance from\\nthe perspective of keeping peace. There's also a US presidential election\\nhere in the United States next year. You had a nice rapport with former\\nPresident Donald Trump. He's leading in the Republican primary\\npolls. If he was to come to power, do you think\\nthe US would continue to support Ukraine?\\nBecause he's been very critical of that aid going to Kiev, said of Shishkin.\\nFirst and foremost, keeps changing it. I'm deeply convinced it is not only my\\nconviction, but the conviction of many Polish politicians that our alliance\\nwith the United States is of absolutely importance for our security and for the\\nsecurity of Europe. Not only the United States is our most\\nimportant ally. From our perspective, it is not really\\nso important who is the president of the United States?\\nIt is the decision of the American people, the obligation of Polish\\nauthorities. It is my personal opinion is to build\\nthe best possible relationship with the United States, to make progress.\\nThis is of key importance from the perspective of our security and among\\nothers. That was the reason why we changed the\\nagents of the president in the past. Of course, I didn't know who would be\\nthe president. Now we do not know who the president in\\n2025, but one of the priorities of our presidency, because in 2025, Poland will\\nhold the presidency in the European Union for six months.\\nFrom January until June, we will preside over the European Union.\\nIn a nutshell, that Poland will preside over European Union councils.\\nSo the thing is that the priority, which is enshrined among one of the main\\ndirections of our activity in the presidency, one that priority is a\\nstrengthening of transatlantic relations, boosting the alliance between\\nthe European Union and the United States.\\nWe believe that in order to safeguard the security of Europe in the world,\\nalso to safeguard economic development of the European Union, it is of key\\nimportance to cooperate with the United States.\\nWe are convinced about that, and this is what we want to support.\\nThis is what we are doing. More United States in Europe, More\\nEurope in the United States, more cooperation in the continent and between\\nthe continents. The transatlantic cooperation, this is\\naccording to us, that key task which we should be implementing for the security\\nof Europe and the world. And this is what we are trying to do.\\nJust finally, I spoke to Annalena Baerbock this weekend, and she's also\\nhere for the U.N. General Assembly.\\nAnd she said that Europe was in a total shock when Trump first came to power\\nafter the 2016 election. Olaf Schulz, the chancellor of Germany,\\nhas already said he wants Biden to win and he's hopeful Biden would win.\\nWill you weigh in on this presidential election for Trump or Biden at some\\npoint? Right from the beginning, I repeat,\\nI was asked this question for the first time back in 2016 when the presidential\\nelection was coming in the United States, and I had one of my first\\npresidential visits, which I paid here, and I said, the American people will\\ndecide. The American people will elect the\\nperson who, according to them, will be a better president for them and for the\\nUnited States. I did not vote in the US.\\nI vote for president in Poland, and I can speak in Poland about who should be\\npresident, according to my opinion. My opinion as an ordinary citizen and\\nordinary voter in the United States. It is up to the American people to\\ndecide who will be the best president for them.\\nMy duty as Polish president is to make sure that the relationship with the\\nUnited States is as good as it gets. In other words, that myself, as Polish\\npresident have gotten the best possible relations with a U.S.\\npresident, the incumbent, and a future president.\\nSo that from the perspective of Polish-American relations, the Polish\\naffairs are conducted in the best possible way, the most effective way.\\nAndre Duda, thank you so much for your time.\\nPolish President Covenant.

       " 'Welcome to Hungary, a member of\\xa0\\nthe European Union for two decades,\\xa0\\xa0 who is often referred to as the black\\xa0\\nsheep of the European Union family. But why do people think this? Well, under Prime Minister\\xa0\\nViktor Orbán\\'s leadership,\\xa0\\xa0 Hungary has faced criticism for its handling\\xa0\\nof judiciary independence, media landscape,\\xa0\\xa0 and allegations of discrimination. These\\xa0\\nconcerns have led to such significant\\xa0\\xa0 democratic backsliding that a study by the\\xa0\\nNGO Freedom House concluded that since 2010\\xa0\\xa0 Hungary has witnessed such a democratic decline,\\xa0\\nthat it can no longer be called a democracy. The European Union has taken action by freezing\\xa0\\nover 30 billion euros in EU funds designated for\\xa0\\xa0 Hungary and presenting a list of essential\\xa0\\nreforms that must be implemented before the\\xa0\\xa0 funds are released. Naturally, this has\\xa0\\nprovoked a strong reaction from Orbán,\\xa0\\xa0 who has set out to obstruct EU\\xa0\\ninitiatives whenever possible. For instance, one of the European Commission\\'s key\\xa0\\nproposals revolves around allocating 50 billion\\xa0\\xa0 euros to Ukraine and commencing EU membership\\xa0\\nnegotiations with Ukraine in December. However,\\xa0\\xa0 this hinges on unanimous agreement among all 27\\xa0\\nmember states, requiring the approval of each.\\xa0\\xa0 Hungary, on the other hand, has already signalled\\xa0\\nits intent to potentially veto this decision,\\xa0\\xa0 a move some perceive as a form of leverage,in\\xa0\\nother words blackmail, to unfreeze EU funds. This standoff has already happened\\xa0\\nbefore. In December last year,\\xa0\\xa0 Hungary used its veto power to\\xa0\\nblock aid and arms to Ukraine,\\xa0\\xa0 as well as a minimum corporation tax rate of 15%\\xa0\\nfor companies across the EU. However, once the\\xa0\\xa0 EU unfroze a portion of the funds designated\\xa0\\nfor Hungary, the country withdrew its veto. This game of cat and mouse is\\xa0\\ncounterproductive and cripples\\xa0\\xa0 the EU’s ability to respond to\\xa0\\ninternational crises quickly. So, what can the EU do in response? Well, the EU has a potential solution\\xa0\\nin its toolkit, called Article 7,\\xa0\\xa0 often referred to as the \"nuclear option.\"\\xa0\\nThis measure involves suspending a member\\xa0\\xa0 state\\'s voting rights within the EU, effectively\\xa0\\nlimiting its ability to influence EU decisions.\\xa0\\xa0 This would mean that Hungary could no\\xa0\\nlonger obstruct key EU legislation. So how does this work? The process begins with the European\\xa0\\nCouncil, where the heads of state from EU\\xa0\\xa0 member countries must collectively assess and\\xa0\\nreach a consensus regarding whether a member\\xa0\\xa0 state is persistently breaching EU values,\\xa0\\nsuch as democracy and the rule of law. Once\\xa0\\xa0 unanimous agreement among the European Council\\xa0\\nmembers is achieved, Article 7 can be initiated. Subsequently, the matter proceeds\\xa0\\nto the European Parliament,\\xa0\\xa0 where a confirmation of the breach\\xa0\\nrequires a four-fifths majority vote.\\xa0\\xa0 Once the European Parliament confirms\\xa0\\nthe breach, Article 7 can be invoked,\\xa0\\xa0 resulting in the suspension of the member\\xa0\\nstate\\'s voting rights within EU institutions.\\xa0\\xa0 This process underscores the EU\\'s commitment to\\xa0\\nupholding its fundamental values and principles. The European Parliament even voted in overwhelming\\xa0\\nfavour to start this process in 2018 and in 2022. So why has this not already happened with Hungary?\\xa0\\nWell, Hungary has a key partner in crime: Poland. Under the governance of Poland\\'s ruling Law\\xa0\\nand Justice Party (PiS), there has been a\\xa0\\xa0 consistent alignment with Hungary in defending\\xa0\\none another on the EU level. Both countries,\\xa0\\xa0 often sharing similar views on issues related\\xa0\\nto national sovereignty and EU values,\\xa0\\xa0 have worked together to resist\\xa0\\npotential sanctions and measures\\xa0\\xa0 stemming from concerns about democratic\\xa0\\nbacksliding within the EU. In practice,\\xa0\\xa0 this means that any attempt to trigger article 7\\xa0\\nfor Hungary will just be blocked by Poland\\'s Veto. But things have changed. The elections held in Poland on October 15th\\xa0\\nmarked a significant setback for the Law and\\xa0\\xa0 Justice Party (PiS), which secured only 194\\xa0\\nseats. And their potential coalition partner\\xa0\\xa0 scored a mere 18 seats. In response, the main\\xa0\\nopposition, Civic Coalition, led by former Prime\\xa0\\xa0 Minister and ex European Council President Donald\\xa0\\nTusk, along with the Third Way and the Left,\\xa0\\xa0 have joined forces to form a coalition government\\xa0\\nto remove PiS from office. Collectively,\\xa0\\xa0 they hold 248 seats, granting them the majority\\xa0\\nrequired to rule and shape Poland\\'s future This marks a remarkable victory\\xa0\\nfor politician Donald Tusk,\\xa0\\xa0 as his leadership\\xa0\\xa0and strong EU profile is great news for\\xa0\\nthe EU, as his government is poised to\\xa0\\xa0 uphold EU principles concerning\\xa0\\ndemocracy and the rule of law. What about Hungary? It goes without saying\\xa0\\nthat this is bad news for Orban. Without Poland\\'s\\xa0\\xa0 support, Hungary runs the risk of losing\\xa0\\ntheir voting rights within the European Union. Or do they? Enter Slovakia. Following the recent Slovakian elections on\\xa0\\nSeptember 30th, Fico, the leader of SMER,\\xa0\\xa0 a social democratic and left-wing populist party,\\xa0\\nsecured victory. His election campaign included\\xa0\\xa0 pledges to halt military aid to Ukraine and\\xa0\\ncriticism of sanctions on Russia. Fico\\'s leadership may steer Slovakia closer to Hungary,\\xa0\\ndistancing itself from the unified stance on\\xa0\\xa0 supporting Ukraine that the EU and Western\\xa0\\nnations have aimed to uphold. Furthermore,\\xa0\\xa0 Slovakia might fill the void that Poland has\\xa0\\nleft behind and become Hungary\\'s new partner\\xa0\\xa0 in crime when it comes to defending\\xa0\\none another when facing Article 7. Here is what we think. The fundamental\\xa0\\nquestion is whether the EU should even\\xa0\\xa0 attempt to trigger Article 7 against Hungary in\\xa0\\nthe first place. It\\'s a complex dilemma. Orban\\xa0\\xa0 could exploit his inability to vote in the EU as\\xa0\\nammunition to further criticise the organisation,\\xa0\\xa0 especially given his control over the media in\\xa0\\nHungary. This could potentially shift Hungary\\xa0\\xa0 from being one of the most pro-EU countries\\xa0\\nto a Eurosceptic one. On the flip side,\\xa0\\xa0 waiting until the Hungarian elections in\\xa0\\n2026 carries the risk of significant damage,\\xa0\\xa0 as the EU might encounter obstructions at every\\xa0\\nturn. Not to mention, Orban might win again. From our viewpoint, it\\'s becoming increasingly\\xa0\\nevident that a multi-tiered Europe might offer\\xa0\\xa0 the most viable solution. In this scenario, some\\xa0\\ncountries would engage in deeper integration while\\xa0\\xa0 others take a more restrained approach.\\xa0\\nThis would imply that Hungary remains an\\xa0\\xa0 important EU member but must undergo reforms\\xa0\\nbefore ascending to a more integrated EU tier. For a more comprehensive explanation, subscribe\\xa0\\nto watch our upcoming video on this concept,\\xa0\\xa0 or refer to an earlier video on the screen for\\xa0\\na preliminary understanding of this approach.\\xa0\\xa0 But please bear in mind that it is one of our older\\xa0\\nvideos :). With older animation. But please also let us know in the\\xa0\\xa0 comments what you think the EU should do.\\xa0\\nThanks for watching and until next time.

       " \"Europe is in disarray as the prospect of\\xa0\\nfull-scale war on the continent becomes\\xa0\\xa0 more and more likely. While\\xa0\\nother nations are panicking,\\xa0\\xa0 one has taken the opportunity to arm up and\\xa0\\nensure its sovereignty cannot be challenged\\xa0\\xa0 by the looming Russian bear in the east. Let’s\\xa0\\nlook at this surprising dark horse in the current\\xa0\\xa0 European arms race and how its history is\\xa0\\nshaping its ongoing rapid militarization. On the first day of World War II, the German\\xa0\\narmy surged across the borders of Poland with\\xa0\\xa0 a blitzkrieg of infantry and armored\\xa0\\ncars. From the north, south, and west,\\xa0\\xa0 the invaders came, aided by Slovak forces\\xa0\\nand its temporary ally, the Soviet Union.\\xa0\\xa0 The Polish government was not prepared for the\\xa0\\nonslaught that was about to ravage their nation. There was no chance to negotiate with\\xa0\\nGermans, who had made up their mind,\\xa0\\xa0 so Poland quickly rallied its available defenses.\\xa0\\nIn one skirmish, German infantry were caught\\xa0\\xa0 off guard by a cavalry charge led by Colonel\\xa0\\nKazimierz Mastalerz. Even with the advantage\\xa0\\xa0 of modern firearms, the Germans couldn’t fend\\xa0\\noff an entire Polish squadron on horseback. The invading infantry was forced to disperse,\\xa0\\nbut before the cavalry could celebrate this\\xa0\\xa0 minor victory, machine gun fire ripped\\xa0\\nthrough the air towards the riders and\\xa0\\xa0 their horses. Alongside German reconnaissance\\xa0\\nvehicles, modern German tactics and technology\\xa0\\xa0 decimated the Polish troops. Colonel Mastalerz\\xa0\\nwas killed in the ensuing fire, as well as one\\xa0\\xa0 of his subordinate officers, and the rest of\\xa0\\nthe cavalry was forced to gallop to cover. This historic battle between Polish cavalrymen\\xa0\\nand German heavy artillery came to be known as\\xa0\\xa0 the Charge at Krojanty, and it has lived\\xa0\\non as an exaggerated myth in a number of\\xa0\\xa0 propaganda campaigns. Due to a critical lapse in\\xa0\\ncommunication, the events of the day were falsely\\xa0\\xa0 reported by Italian journalists as having included\\xa0\\na direct cavalry charge from the Polish against\\xa0\\xa0 German tanks. While this interpretation was\\xa0\\nbased on gruesome photographs of the aftermath,\\xa0\\xa0 the image of riders with lances and\\xa0\\nswords facing down invaders with far\\xa0\\xa0 greater military capabilities was embedded in\\xa0\\nthe collective consciousness of the modern world. Nazi Germany used this mythological visualization\\xa0\\nof the Charge of Krojanty to boast about how\\xa0\\xa0 advanced their weaponry was as well as to\\xa0\\nimply that they had more tanks to utilize\\xa0\\xa0 against their enemies than they truly did.\\xa0\\nSoviet Propaganda took this a step further,\\xa0\\xa0 implying that Poland had sent many members of\\xa0\\ntheir cavalry to die out of complete ignorance. In\\xa0\\xa0 the constructed Soviet view of the events, Polish\\xa0\\nmilitary leadership was reckless and unwilling to\\xa0\\xa0 modernize their army. This piece of propaganda was\\xa0\\ntaught in many schools up until the 1990s, leading\\xa0\\xa0 to many people growing up thinking the Polish army\\xa0\\nwas fundamentally weak and unwilling to modernize. Of course this is just a piece of propaganda, even\\xa0\\nin the year 1939, Poland was already developing\\xa0\\xa0 its own motorized battalions and was implementing\\xa0\\nanti-tank artillery within its armed forces.\\xa0\\xa0 Though still considerably less powerful than the\\xa0\\ngreat powers at the time, Poland was nowhere near\\xa0\\xa0 as ignorant of the advances in warfare as either\\xa0\\nNazi or Soviet narratives implied. Even so,\\xa0\\xa0 history is written by the victors, and\\xa0\\nthe myth of the Charge of Krojanty stuck,\\xa0\\xa0 especially as Poland struggled to keep up with\\xa0\\nthe rest of its allies during World War II.\\xa0 But times are changing, and Poland has taken\\xa0\\nit upon itself to disprove this lasting myth.\\xa0\\xa0 The once downtrodden republic has come a\\xa0\\nlong way from its prior crushing defeats,\\xa0\\xa0 which ironically might have been the key\\xa0\\nfactor in galvanizing Poland towards efficient\\xa0\\xa0 self-defense. Poland is quickly becoming\\xa0\\nEurope’s underdog military powerhouse,\\xa0\\xa0 but before you find out how,\\xa0\\nyou need to find out why. The Charge at Krojanty was only the beginning of\\xa0\\nPoland’s struggles during the Second World War,\\xa0\\xa0 as the fighting both within and beyond the\\xa0\\nborders brought many Poles to the front lines.\\xa0\\xa0 Domestically, the German occupation was opposed\\xa0\\nby an expansive resistance network that provided\\xa0\\xa0 43% of all reports to British intelligence coming\\xa0\\nfrom central Europe. Abroad, Polish troops were\\xa0\\xa0 the fourth largest demographic among soldiers\\xa0\\nacross the European fronts. Even as an underground\\xa0\\xa0 state, Poland was already making itself an\\xa0\\ninstrumental part of the Allied war effort. Though liberating Europe from the Nazis was the\\xa0\\ngoal, Poland had a responsibility to itself as\\xa0\\xa0 well. It resented the possibility that its\\xa0\\nterritory could remain occupied after the\\xa0\\xa0 war by an opportunistic foreign power. These fears\\xa0\\nwere confirmed when their own government-in-exile\\xa0\\xa0 was given no sway over the proceedings at the\\xa0\\nYalta Conference. The communist dictator Joseph\\xa0\\xa0 Stalin made a power grab that forced Poland to\\xa0\\ncapitulate to the whims of the Soviet state. Under the guise of allowing Poland to retain\\xa0\\nnational sovereignty, elections were rigged,\\xa0\\xa0 and the mechanisms of governance\\xa0\\nwere used deceptively to promote\\xa0\\xa0 a pro-Soviet and pro-Communist policy plan. With the rest of Poland’s European allies\\xa0\\nhaving effectively turned their back on\\xa0\\xa0 the occupied nation, the Polish people were\\xa0\\nstuck contending with Stalinist oppression.\\xa0\\xa0 This sudden betrayal would linger in\\xa0\\nthe minds future generations to come. Once again, Poland’s sense of national\\xa0\\nidentity was resilient in the face of\\xa0\\xa0 outside authoritarianism. Many of the\\xa0\\nsame resistance organizations that were\\xa0\\xa0 active during German occupation had\\xa0\\ngrown into political movements that\\xa0\\xa0 stood in opposition to communist\\xa0\\nrule. These included the Freedom\\xa0\\xa0 and Independence Association as well as\\xa0\\nthe Polish home army or “Armia Krajowa.” The most powerful force in overcoming communism\\xa0\\nwas the trade unions - which brought about social\\xa0\\xa0 justice and workers' rights on a level that\\xa0\\nStalinist communism was incapable of offering.\\xa0\\xa0 This united movement of solidarity allowed Poland\\xa0\\nto take power back into the hands of its people,\\xa0\\xa0 and with support from the United States as\\xa0\\nwell as the Catholic Church, succeeded in\\xa0\\xa0 a non-violent revolution that stamped out all\\xa0\\nremaining elements of communism by the 1990s. Having overcome two different authoritarian\\xa0\\nregimes that sought to exploit the common people\\xa0\\xa0 with lofty promises, Poland under Solidarity\\xa0\\nwas for a brief moment in time positioned\\xa0\\xa0 uniquely as a country that could realistically\\xa0\\nachieve the supposed aims of both fascism and\\xa0\\xa0 communism without the corruption and deception\\xa0\\ncommon in real life examples of both ideologies. This unique situation would not last, however,\\xa0\\nas the onset of liberal capitalism throughout\\xa0\\xa0 the 1990s cooled Poland into becoming less of\\xa0\\na radical powder keg. But even while Poland\\xa0\\xa0 comfortably faded into the background of global\\xa0\\npolitics, there was one value that remained as\\xa0\\xa0 an overriding principle for its future endeavors.\\xa0\\nThat value is the importance of self-sufficiency. This is how we’ve arrived at a current\\xa0\\nmoment where Poland has shored up its\\xa0\\xa0 defenses to the point of eclipsing several\\xa0\\nof its neighbors in raw firepower. Being\\xa0\\xa0 situated in the center of a region that\\xa0\\nhas, for decades, been threatened by war,\\xa0\\xa0 Poland stands to gain a lot by making itself the\\xa0\\ndominant military force in Eastern Central Europe. In terms of raw personnel, Poland currently has a\\xa0\\nslightly smaller army than its former adversary,\\xa0\\xa0 Germany. But Minister of Defense Mariusz\\xa0\\nBłaszczak has announced plans to swell\\xa0\\xa0 those numbers to a total of 300,000 by 2035\\xa0\\n- which would officially put Poland head\\xa0\\xa0 and shoulders above any mainland European\\xa0\\nnation army with the exception of Russia. Poland’s growing dominance in the region will\\xa0\\nlikely grow as Germany continues to be reluctant\\xa0\\xa0 to fully remilitarize in accordance with its\\xa0\\nown Morgenthau Plan following World War II.\\xa0\\xa0 Poland’s geographical proximity to the Baltic\\xa0\\nStates will also make them the most reliable\\xa0\\xa0 defender of the vulnerable NATO members. This\\xa0\\nwould put it on almost even footing with France\\xa0\\xa0 as NATO’s primary or secondary European power,\\xa0\\neclipsing the once prominent United Kingdom. So what exactly are Poland’s plans,\\xa0\\xa0 and will they really turn a historical\\xa0\\nunderdog into a rising Great Power? Even without the sheer numbers\\xa0\\npromised by the new recruitment plan,\\xa0\\xa0 Poland’s land forces are already formidable.\\xa0\\nPoland possesses a much greater number of tanks\\xa0\\xa0 and howitzers than most of its neighbors and\\xa0\\nis on track to have more than Germany, Italy,\\xa0\\xa0 and France combined. These heavy metal weapons\\xa0\\nare primarily of American and South Korean make,\\xa0\\xa0 and have the top-notch specs to match. Military\\xa0\\ntrade deals such as these free Poland up from\\xa0\\xa0 relying on outdated Russian weaponry, which,\\xa0\\nas can be seen in Russia’s catastrophic loss\\xa0\\xa0 of tanks in Ukraine, have been shown to\\xa0\\nhave some rather severe design flaws. As part of this effort to modernize, Poland\\xa0\\nhas steadily been replacing Russian-made tanks\\xa0\\xa0 with the state-of-the-art M1 Abrams - an American\\xa0\\ntank that boasts both extreme mobility and highly\\xa0\\xa0 durable armor. The stunning reputation of the\\xa0\\nAbrams as a battle tank cannot be understated,\\xa0\\xa0 and the United States has used this tank to\\xa0\\ngreat effect in its own foreign skirmishes. The use of depleted uranium in the armor\\xa0\\nmakes the M1 Abrams highly resistant to\\xa0\\xa0 both ballistics and explosives, and\\xa0\\nvery few that have been deployed have\\xa0\\xa0 ever been critically damaged. Among\\xa0\\nthose Abrams tanks that were downed,\\xa0\\xa0 several were taken out by friendly fire from\\xa0\\nthe anti-tank weaponry of other Abrams units. With a 1500 horsepower turbine that can maneuver\\xa0\\nthe tank across all manner of difficult terrain,\\xa0\\xa0 the Abrams is able to run down opposing\\xa0\\ntanks and destroy them at close range.\\xa0\\xa0 And with two high-caliber machine\\xa0\\nguns in addition to the main cannon,\\xa0\\xa0 the tank has more than enough\\xa0\\nfirepower to do just that. Compared to a Russian T-72, which is\\xa0\\na considerably lighter tank that has a\\xa0\\xa0 maximum speed of 37 miles per hour, the M1 Abrams\\xa0\\xa0 can travel 45 miles per hour while still\\xa0\\ncarrying the weight of its heavy armor. The most revolutionary feature of the M1 Abrams\\xa0\\nby far is its onboard communication systems,\\xa0\\xa0 which include blue force tracking and infrared\\xa0\\nsights to enhance visibility and cooperation\\xa0\\xa0 with friendly units on the battlefield. These\\xa0\\ntools help with heightened battlefield awareness,\\xa0\\xa0 making the Abrams a combat vehicle\\xa0\\nthat reaps great rewards when it’s\\xa0\\xa0 piloted by a significantly competent\\xa0\\nand well-trained four-person team. Apart from the Abrams, Poland has acquired a large\\xa0\\nsupply of K2 Black Panther tanks from South Korea\\xa0\\xa0 and has announced plans to open a factory that\\xa0\\nwill construct them domestically. Dubbed the\\xa0\\xa0 “most expensive tank in the world”, the K2 was\\xa0\\ndeveloped as a modification of the standard M1\\xa0\\xa0 Abrams into a sleeker and smaller battle tank with\\xa0\\neven greater mobility options. Its ability to ford\\xa0\\xa0 across medium-depth bodies of water through\\xa0\\nhydropneumatic suspension is unmatched by any\\xa0\\xa0 armored vehicle in history. Additionally, the K2\\xa0\\nBlack Panther boasts unique weapon systems that\\xa0\\xa0 surpass the Abrams in tank-to-tank combat - most\\xa0\\nnotably the Korean Smart Top-Attack Munition or\\xa0\\xa0 KSTAM fired from the cannon. The KSTAM is guided\\xa0\\nthrough smart munitions technology to seek out\\xa0\\xa0 the weakest parts of enemy tanks, and is a recent\\xa0\\ninnovation of South Korean military technology. While the overall similarities in\\xa0\\nappearance between the K2 Panther\\xa0\\xa0 and M1 Abrams have given it a second nickname\\xa0\\n(the “baby abrams” due to its smaller size),\\xa0\\xa0 taking the South Korean tank\\xa0\\nlightly would be a grave mistake. The hefty price tag on the 1000 K2 Black Panthers\\xa0\\nPoland has purchased is especially daunting,\\xa0\\xa0 but given that it’s the most powerful\\xa0\\npound-for-pound tank on the market,\\xa0\\xa0 the price tag is justified. Poland will be the\\xa0\\nfirst nation in both the European Union and\\xa0\\xa0 NATO to utilize these marvels of South Korean\\xa0\\nengineering outside of their native country,\\xa0\\xa0 and by producing them domestically\\xa0\\n- the republic might even have the\\xa0\\xa0 power to develop its own cheaper\\xa0\\nbut comparably effective variation. But there are other strategic purchases that\\xa0\\nPoland has made to improve both its ground\\xa0\\xa0 and anti-air capabilities, such as the 500\\xa0\\nHIMARS rocket launchers, which were acquired\\xa0\\xa0 from the U.S. for $10 Billion. HIMARS or High\\xa0\\nMobility Artillery Rocket Systems have proved\\xa0\\xa0 indispensable in Ukraine for their ability to\\xa0\\npenetrate through Russian anti-missile defenses,\\xa0\\xa0 and are likely to become a staple of NATO’s\\xa0\\nmilitary arsenal in future conflicts. Poland's own missile defense\\xa0\\nsystem has been improved by\\xa0\\xa0 a $4.75 billion order of Patriot\\xa0\\nmissiles from the United States. Not to neglect aerial combat, Poland is also\\xa0\\nlooking to buy an array of helicopters and drones\\xa0\\xa0 from America or whatever other ally will provide\\xa0\\nsuch equipment. 48 FA50 light attack aircraft have\\xa0\\xa0 also been purchased from South Korea to diversify\\xa0\\nthe speed and mobility of Poland’s air support. The mustering of all these impressive\\xa0\\npieces of military hardware could lead\\xa0\\xa0 to the fulfillment of Poland’s\\xa0\\npromise to itself and its allies:\\xa0\\xa0 becoming “the strongest military power\\xa0\\non land in central and Eastern Europe.” The United States military understands\\xa0\\nthe key importance of Poland’s location,\\xa0\\xa0 and agreed to allow their 5th Army Corps to\\xa0\\nreside permanently within the country. Poland\\xa0\\xa0 developing more potent land forces is the most\\xa0\\nsensical option for its own defense, as well as\\xa0\\xa0 giving the republic a distinctly advantageous\\xa0\\nposition as the eastern bulwark of NATO. The ease with which Poland can roll out\\xa0\\nthe heavy artillery in mainland Europe\\xa0\\xa0 is especially relevant because of the ongoing\\xa0\\nimperialist actions of Russia. The conflict in\\xa0\\xa0 Ukraine is only the most recent example of Russian\\xa0\\naggression, and given that Poland shares a border\\xa0\\xa0 with Ukraine - there is a lot of justification for\\xa0\\nPoland to be concerned about its own protection. Russian military command has all but signaled\\xa0\\ndirect hostility towards Poland with inflammatory\\xa0\\xa0 and dehumanizing statements such\\xa0\\nas those made by Dmitry Medvedev,\\xa0\\xa0 deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council: “I see no point in maintaining diplomatic\\xa0\\nrelations with Poland. This state must\\xa0\\xa0 not exist for us while there is no one\\xa0\\nbut Russophobes in power and Ukraine is\\xa0\\xa0 full of Polish mercenaries, who should be\\xa0\\nruthlessly exterminated like stinky rats.” Further remarks from the Kremlin indicate\\xa0\\na desire to “deNazify” Poland in a blatant\\xa0\\xa0 attempt to justify the possibility of another\\xa0\\nannexation effort. In the process, Russia has\\xa0\\xa0 also removed memorials that honored Polish\\xa0\\npeople killed at the hands of Soviet Soldiers\\xa0\\xa0 in the past - a callous and ahistorical attempt\\xa0\\nat downplaying their country's own brutal past. Threats of nuclear brinkmanship in the\\xa0\\nform of stationing missiles on Poland’s\\xa0\\xa0 eastern border have also raised concerns\\xa0\\nabout how far Russia is willing to go. This open hostility towards Poland from the\\xa0\\nRussian government is distressing, but sadly\\xa0\\xa0 not unfamiliar. Just like in the years leading\\xa0\\nup to World War II, an expansionist dictator\\xa0\\xa0 with a mind for empire-building is threatening\\xa0\\nto conquer much of Europe - and in this case,\\xa0\\xa0 it’s not Germany but the other country\\xa0\\nthat Poland has a troubled history with. But it's not just invading forces like Russia\\xa0\\nthat history has made Poland wary of. The German\\xa0\\xa0 invasion and the Soviet occupation both share\\xa0\\none common factor: when Poland was in need,\\xa0\\xa0 the other allied superpowers did not readily give\\xa0\\nthem the help they requested. On a national level,\\xa0\\xa0 the push for self-sufficiency is not simply a\\xa0\\nphilosophical preference for growing stronger,\\xa0\\xa0 it’s also a bitter acknowledgement that\\xa0\\nthe nation may have nobody else to rely on. On 2022’s Polish Independence Day, the country's\\xa0\\nPrime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said:\\xa0\\xa0 “The Polish army must be so powerful that it does\\xa0\\nnot have to fight due to its strength alone.” The silver lining to this current moment\\xa0\\nis that the world is much more aware of\\xa0\\xa0 and engaged in the project of stopping Russia\\xa0\\nfrom carrying on its war in Ukraine. The United\\xa0\\xa0 States has shown itself to be a stalwart ally\\xa0\\nof Ukraine in regards to sending weapons and\\xa0\\xa0 denouncing Russia’s actions, and the emphasis\\xa0\\non foreign policy under the administration of\\xa0\\xa0 President Biden could set a precedent that\\xa0\\nextends to Poland in the case of the worst. The former deputy assistant\\xa0\\nsecretary general of NATO,\\xa0\\xa0 Dr. Shea, had this to say in\\xa0\\nregards to Poland’s militarization: “What Poland is doing is very welcome, but\\xa0\\nit won't make sense going [at] it alone.” This statement could be seen as an\\xa0\\nindication that NATO has no intention\\xa0\\xa0 of under-serving Poland in any upcoming\\xa0\\nskirmish, but skepticism remains among\\xa0\\xa0 Polish leadership as larger and more concrete\\xa0\\npromises have been made and broken before. Yet, Morawieki has not signaled any lack of trust\\xa0\\nin his allies, and disagreed with former President\\xa0\\xa0 Emmanuel Macron of France over whether the goal\\xa0\\nof European autonomy from the United States is\\xa0\\xa0 a worthwhile one. While visiting Washington, the\\xa0\\nPrime Minister made clear his intention to seek a\\xa0\\xa0 closer bond between Poland and the United States,\\xa0\\nstating that if “countries west of Poland” do not\\xa0\\xa0 understand why such an alliance is necessary it\\xa0\\nwas “probably due to historical circumstances.” “Poland is trying to maintain the most common\\xa0\\nsense policy based on a close alliance with the\\xa0\\xa0 United States within the framework of the European\\xa0\\nUnion, and this is the best path for Poland.” Though the fighting in Ukraine is far from over,\\xa0\\nand Poland has not officially entered the war,\\xa0\\xa0 being prepared for a ground invasion from\\xa0\\nRussia is worth the cost in their eyes.\\xa0\\xa0 Poland cannot allow itself to suffer\\xa0\\na modern equivalent to the Charge at\\xa0\\xa0 Krojanty - not in sensationalized mythology\\xa0\\nor cold hard reality. And furthermore,\\xa0\\xa0 it might not be able to afford to wait for\\xa0\\ndistant allies in the event of a Russian\\xa0\\xa0 attack or rely on the goodwill of other world\\xa0\\npowers in case of a challenge on its sovereignty. In order to be NATO’s first\\xa0\\nline of defense against Russia,\\xa0\\xa0 Poland has chosen to spend 3% of its GDP on\\xa0\\ndefense - the highest allocation of defense\\xa0\\xa0 budget in its region. Greece is the second highest\\xa0\\nin Europe, with 2.8% of its GDP going to defense,\\xa0\\xa0 and its pockets for foreign weapons\\xa0\\naren’t as deep. At least not as deep\\xa0\\xa0 as Poland is willing to go in order to face\\xa0\\ndown the profound threat of Putin’s Russia. To quote Polish General Rajmund\\xa0\\nAndrzejczak in a recent press conference,\\xa0\\xa0 “We just took our suitcases with money\\xa0\\nand [we’re] going like Hell around the\\xa0\\xa0 world and trying to buy… It’s not a matter of\\xa0\\nmoney. I’ve got money. I’ve got big money.” The aforementioned tanks and rocket launchers are\\xa0\\nonly the beginning, but as for where the economic\\xa0\\xa0 wealth to pay for this surge of military might\\xa0\\ncame from, the answers are surprisingly simple.\\xa0\\xa0 The diaspora of Polish tradespeople who emigrated\\xa0\\nto other countries over the past century has\\xa0\\xa0 begun to return to the country with much higher\\xa0\\nnet worths for themselves and their families. The capitalist success of Poles overseas in the\\xa0\\nUnited States of America, as well as throughout\\xa0\\xa0 several regions of Europe, has directly caused\\xa0\\nwealth to flow back into their homeland. Wealth\\xa0\\xa0 that can now be used to reinvest in a future\\xa0\\nwithout the threat of being bowled over by a\\xa0\\xa0 mightier power. Whether the GDP of Poland\\xa0\\ncan truly bear the weight of this costly\\xa0\\xa0 investment remains to be seen, but the\\xa0\\nsuccess story has a sensational appeal\\xa0\\xa0 to it. This emphasis on the achievements of\\xa0\\ntalented workers who are loyal to and enrich\\xa0\\xa0 their nation is, in some ways, a modern\\xa0\\nreflection of the values of solidarity. But if all these indications are correct,\\xa0\\nnon-violence may not be the direction in\\xa0\\xa0 which the country goes. With all this military\\xa0\\nspending in the name of maintaining stability\\xa0\\xa0 and self-sufficiency, Poland runs the risk of\\xa0\\naccelerating tensions and creating a deepened\\xa0\\xa0 climate of hostility. The newfound focus on\\xa0\\nexpanding the defense budget could be exactly\\xa0\\xa0 what the right-wing Law and Justice Party is\\xa0\\nlooking for to maintain power and approval,\\xa0\\xa0 and what would begin as a justified\\xa0\\nemphasis on national security could\\xa0\\xa0 grow into warmongering rhetoric if left unchecked. Robert Czulda, a military expert from the Casimir\\xa0\\nPulaski Foundation, is not so convinced of the\\xa0\\xa0 practicality of the plan nor impressed by\\xa0\\nthe appeals to the collective. He states: “It seems highly likely that such a large scale\\xa0\\nof planned orders is largely driven by a political\\xa0\\xa0 populism, aimed at gaining popularity\\xa0\\nhere and now, rather than to be a real,\\xa0\\xa0 comprehensive, and well-thought-out plan for\\xa0\\nharmoniously strengthening the armed forces.” On the other hand, historical precedent has\\xa0\\nshown us that appeasement is ineffective when\\xa0\\xa0 it comes to totalitarians like Putin - and show\\xa0\\nof force might be the only viable solution to\\xa0\\xa0 the mounting problem of Russian imperialism.\\xa0\\nWhether it’s a ploy for re-election or not,\\xa0\\xa0 the fact of the matter is that the economic\\xa0\\nrisk is a less devastating one than the\\xa0\\xa0 risk of Poland being subject to one more\\xa0\\noccupation by an autocracy. Should these\\xa0\\xa0 ambitious goals be completed within their\\xa0\\ntime frame, Poland is all but guaranteed to\\xa0\\xa0 become a military power that can serve\\xa0\\nas NATO’s backbone within its region.

JUST THIS MORNING, TO WAGNER OPERATIVES WERE DETAINED BY POLISH AUTHORITIES ACCUSED OF DISTRIBUTING PROPAGANDA MATERIALS IN WARSAW AMONG MANY OTHER CITIES. AND SO I THINK THAT THE SITUATION IS BECOMING REALLY VERY SENSITIVE FROM OUR PEOPLE, NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF OUR POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT, BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF OUR MILITARY INVOLVEMENT IN THAT AREA. >> AS WE KNOW, THE PLAN TO SEND 10,000 TROOPS TO THE POLICE EASTERN BORDER, AND RUSSIA HAS JUST ANNOUNCED THAT IT'S PLANNING TO DISCUSS AT LEAST SENDING RUSSIAN TROOPS TO ITS WESTERN BORDER, CITING POLAND OF ALL REASONS FOR THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS. I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR OR HAVE YOU LISTEN TO WHAT RUSSIAN DEFENSE MINISTER SERGEI SHOIGU SAID ABOUT THIS ISSUE. >> [INTERPRETER] THERE ARE EXISTING RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MILITARIZATION OF POLAND WHICH HAS BECOME THE MAIN INSTRUMENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND ANTI RUSSIAN POLICY WARSAW ANNOUNCED THE INTENTION TO BUILD, ACCORDING TO THE POLLS, THE MOST POWERFUL ARMY ON THE CONTINENT. >> WHAT ARE THE RISKS THAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT, IF YOU HAVE ANY INSIGHT INTO THAT? >> OF COURSE WE WOULD LIKE TO AVOID ANY CONFRONTATION A DIRECT MILITARY PUSH WITH THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. WE DON'T WANT TO DRAG NATO INTO A POTENTIAL WAR WITH RUSSIA, ESPECIALLY TODAY BUT WE KNOW VERY WELL, ON THE OTHER HAND, THAT THE RUSSIAN ARMY FOR EXAMPLE HAS PERFORMED SO MISERABLY IN UKRAINE, AND NO WONDER THAT THE RUSSIANS ARE PRETTY MUCH PREOCCUPIED WITH OUR EFFORTS TO REINFORCE OUR MILITARY CAPABILITIES NOT ONLY ALONG OUR BORDER WITH BELARUS AND WITH THE -- BUT GENERALLY. WE HAVE ENTERED A PATH OF MAYBE NOT MILITARIZATION AS SHOIGU HAS JUST SAID, BUT TRYING TO BUILD ONE OF THE STRONGEST ARMIES IN EUROPE AGAIN, BECAUSE POLAND HAS BEEN PERCEIVED UNTIL RECENTLY AS A NET RECIPIENT OF SECURITY. WE ARE NOW TRANSITIONING INTO THE ROLE OF NET PROVIDER OF SECURITY, ALSO FOR OUR PARTNERS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND NATO. YOU KNOW, RUSSIAN OFFICIALS, MR. SHOIGU BEING ONE OF THEM, LOVE TO SWALLOW AND KOOKY CONSPIRACY THEORIES WE HAVE ALSO HEARD HIS REMARKS ABOUT OUR WILLINGNESS TO INVADE WESTERN UKRAINE. OF COURSE THOSE REMARKS ARE AS OUTLANDISH AS IT GETS, AND WE HAVE ALREADY REBOUNDED MANY OF THOSE ALLEGATIONS ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS THERE IS OF COURSE A KIND OF ADVISORY AND THAT PART OF THE WORLD, BUT I THINK THAT NOBODY HAS ANY DOUBT WHATSOEVER WHO IS THE AGGRESSOR AND WHO IS COMMITTED PROFOUNDLY TO DEFEND THEIR BORDERS AND THEIR SECURITY IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE. >> IN A RECENT INTERVIEW ON CNN, YOUR DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER ACCUSED BOTH MOSCOW AND MINSK OF TRANSPORTING ILLEGAL MIGRANTS TO THE POLISH BORDER IN ORDER TO DESTABILIZE THE REGION. THAT HAS ECHOES OF WHAT WE SAW IN 2021 BEFORE THE FEBRUARY 2022 INVASION. LARGE SCALE INVASION OF UKRAINE BY RUSSIA AND THAT WAS POLAND ACCUSING PRESIDENT LUKASHENKO OF MANUFACTURING A MIGRANT CRISIS OF SORTS AT ITS BORDER. AND THAT'S YOU KNOW, SOME OF YOUR TACTICS AND POLAND'S RESPONSE TO THIS DREW CONDEMNATION FROM YOUR EU ALLIES AND MEMBERS AS WELL. THERE IS AN ELECTION COMING UP IN YOUR COUNTRY IN JUST A FEW MONTHS IN OCTOBER. IS THERE ANY REASON FOR YOUR ALLIES ONCE AGAIN TO BE CONCERNED THAT PERHAPS THIS BORDER ISSUE IS BEING POLITICIZED? >> UNFORTUNATELY, WE CAN EXPECT BOTH RUSSIA AND BELARUS TO WEAPONIZE ANOTHER MIGRATION CRISIS ALONG THAT BORDER. ORCHESTRATED BY BELARUS, BUT QUITE CLEARLY INSTIGATED BY THE KREMLIN AS YOU KNOW, WE HAVE ERECTED A FENCE ALONG THE BORDER IN ORDER TO PREVENT ANOTHER CRISIS OF THIS, AND AGAIN, I CAN ONLY REITERATE THAT IT IS OUR OBLIGATION TO DEFEND NOT ONLY POLAND BUT ALSO THE EXTERNAL BORDERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. AND WE ARE DEALING WITH A UNPREDICTABLE THOUGH IT IS ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE TO FORESEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE MONTHS TO COME, BUT I AM SURE THAT WE HAVE TO REMAIN VIGILANT FOR THIS KIND OF OPERATION, THIS KIND OF HYBRID ATTACKS AND ASYMMETRICAL WARFARE. ON THE PART OF BOTH THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND BELARUSIAN. >> THEN WE SEE ANYTHING SIMILAR? ARE YOU EXPECTING THESE SIMILAR TACTICS AS THE ONES DEPLOYED AND 2021 THE LAST TIME WE DISCUSS THOSE BORDER ISSUES? >> I GOT NO DOUBTS WHATSOEVER THAT BOTH THE LUKASHENKO E. JEAN AND PRESIDENT PUTIN WOULD BE READY TO DO ANYTHING TO INTIMIDATE POLAND AND OTHER NATO COUNTRIES. THIS IS ONE OF THE VERY FEW THINGS THAT RUSSIANS AND BELARUSIANS, I'M TALKING ABOUT THE RULING OF LEADS OF COURSE, NOT ABOUT PEOPLES AND NATIONS, BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE VERY FEW THINGS THAT THEY EXCEL AT INTIMIDATING AND INSTILLING FEAR AND WESTERN SOCIETIES, AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO BRACE OURSELVES FOR FURTHER PROVOCATIONS OF THIS SORT. >> YOU, AS WE HAVE NOTICED, I HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE UKRAINE'S STAUNCHEST SUPPORTERS THROUGHOUT THIS WAR, INCREASING YOUR OWN DEFENSE BUDGET CLOSE TO 4% AT THIS POINT AND PROVIDE UKRAINE WITH A LOT OF FINANCIAL AID AS WELL AS A MILITARY AND HUMANITARIAN AID AS WELL. I'M CURIOUS TO GET YOUR RESPONSE TO WHAT YOU ARE SEEING THERE IN WASHINGTON PLAY OUT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES AS WE ENTER OUR OWN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SEASON SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARDS TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND SOME OF THE STATEMENTS THAT WE ARE HEARING FROM THE FRONT RUNNER, FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP ON HIS KNEE IS ON THE WAR AND FUTURE AID TO UKRAINE THAT WOULD BE IN QUESTION BUT NOT JUST, THAT THERE IS A NEW CNN POLL THAT FOUND 55% OF AMERICANS, NOT JUST REPUBLICANS, BUT AMERICANS SAY THAT CONGRESS SHOULD NOT AUTHORIZE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO SUPPORT UKRAINE. HOW IS THAT BEING REACTED TO IN WARSAW AND OTHER EUROPEAN CAPITALS? THAT IMPACTS OUR DIPLOMATIC WORK. WE ARE FOLLOWING THAT AS WELL. THE OTHER THING THAT I CAN TELL YOU, AS A DIPLOMAT, IS WE HAVE BEEN INSISTING ON THE NECESSITY OF TALKING CONSTANTLY WITH AMERICAN LAWMAKERS, REACHING OUT TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC OPINION, IN ORDER TO KEEP VIVID THE AND TRUST IN WHAT IS GOING ON IN EUROPE. THIS IS ALSO IN TERMS OF DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS IN ORDER TO HELP AND ALLOW UKRAINE TO NEW --\\n>> AMBASSADOR, WILL HAVE TO HAVE YOU BACK ON TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION. IN THE MEANTIME, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. WE APPRECIATE IT. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\",\n",
       " \"either fellow travelers mark here with Walters room today we're in Warsaw Poland for things you don't do when you are here in Poland I'm gonna get off the started no need with number one before we get started with number one I'm gonna start at number zero the thing you need to know before you come here is don't tell or call the Polish Eastern Europeans you will not make any friends saying that if you look on the map you'll see the Poland is actually in the center of Europe a little bit north but it's in the center of Europe and they like to be called central Europeans not Eastern European so I want to get that one out of the way first because that's probably your quickest don't really upset people so remember don't say Eastern Europe okay now when you're gonna meet the Polish people here are second or I guess our first don't for you is don't shake hands or say goodbye over the threshold like in a doorway people really don't like that so either make it a choose your side are you in the door or you out of the door when you shake hands and say goodbye just one of those little things there and if you do get to meet some Polish people and they invite you to your home when you go there if you see they're wearing slippers or they're not wearing shoes you don't wear your shoes in the house either it's kind of rude that way so just three quick little ones to start off with just to give you some ideas of hospitality here in Poland so our next don't for you has to do with the language look don't underestimate how helpful a few words of Polish will be for you and your visit here whether you're up in Gdansk you're down at Cracow or Lublin or wherever because we all know that no one watching this video price speaks polish unless you're polish by ancestry and the thing is is the poles know that and so they learned that you know theologically speaking English or German or Russian and stuff like that to help out the tourists but the thing is if you know a free words and polish it really opens the door like people are really happy even if it's just like Jin Korea which is like thank you our pro scene which is pleased our Pivo which is beer I remember I was like people put a seemed like hey you know there is so happy with it and it really goes a long way to open up to people because seals the old note some people seem kind of dour and quiet and Stern sometimes and that's one way to open them up okay now our next don't for you is don't worry about busting your the bank when you come here to Poland pulling is extremely affordable country to visit hotels eating drinking all kinds of stuff making merry it is really cheap here also going to museums is really affordable as well so it's a nice place to check out that's why when you go to Krakow they get ten million tourists from you know high-end tourist alone low-end and low-income not well income but people are spending a lot of money on tourism because it's not a expensive place to be so that's the kind of a cool thing now my fifth don't for you kind of goes along with that cheap eating and drinking don't drink in public in Poland look you can get arrested or fined for drinking in public now you see this guys square here yes you can eat and drink at the restaurants and the bars like that no problem but if you're gonna like take up some wine or a beer some the local beer which are pretty good here and go take that to a park and drink there with your friends you can get in trouble with the cops so make sure you do not drink in public to go along with that don't don't forget you need to have an ID with you all the time if you don't want to carry your passport with you what I do is I actually have my driver's license from home and a photocopy of my passport with my passport locked up back at the hotel so you do have that because the cops could ask you for it if they really wanted to they usually don't bother the tourists so it's not that big of a deal but just in case so you know now our next stunt for you is don't try to pay with big Bill's now big Bill's are like fifty swati's or 100 Sporty's like 100 or 50 it was like under 20 because people ask you all do you have anything smaller they're always gonna ask for a smaller bill the thing is when you go to the ATMs it gives you 50 s and a hundreds when you go get a beer or something like that it's you know seven or eight and like odd you have some smaller bills you have some smaller bills so when you go to museums you go to like big stores and stuff like that use the bigger bills there the hundreds and stuff like that to break them into tens and 20s so then you can go get your little snacks maybe you want your little you know Polish donut or you want to go get a hot dog or something like that when you're here or just grab a beer you need that change ok so don't use the big Bill's here right another don't I half you don't forget to tip when you are here usually a tip ten to fifteen percent ten percent normal fifteen percent of its good but you can look on the men when some restaurants already put that 10% on there I know the place I waited here on the square and I remember don't but you're not gonna bust the bank so it wasn't I hope didn't feel group table because it was so cheap the 10% was already included she was very nice and helpful I gave her a little bit extra on there no big deal okay and going along with that when you pay your bill the Louis asks you don't play with credit card or cash if you're gonna pay with cash if you put the money in the little thing and give it to them don't say thank you unless you want them to keep all the money okay so let's say you know you got a hundred 110 bill and you give them 150 you say thank you or genku you know they go a 40 40 40 tip for me and they'll just walk away with it you need to tell them here is this then they'll bring your change back and then you leave your tip like that so you have those things there what I try to do is just have the tip already there now you might tell them look I want to pay 140 and so they'll just have the tip from there and give your ten back if you have a hundred and a 50 no big deal they're my tenth don't feel is don't be late the polls are actually pretty much an on time kind of people like their German neighbors if you're going to be late to somebody's house you're gonna visit make sure you call or text them or whatsapp them before so they know you're coming behind because it's kind of rude to be late when you are here I mean we were at the muse I was at the Museum this morning and it's supposed to open up at 10:00 the guy unlocked it like in 1001 if you were like come on it says 10 o'clock let's go you know so you do have that there so make sure you are on time and my last don't for you is don't fall for the nature tourism propaganda in Poland look you'll see lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of tourism videos about the nature of Poland and there are some beautiful nature's here the Tatras mountains in the south bicycle pay me goes you know skiing in the summer or summer in the winter you can go to the Missourian lakes the north it's just beautiful there's Castle there there's all kinds of great nature here but look it was your first time to Pullen focus on the cool cities that are here Krakow is amazing with the with the Town Square and the cloth hall and the churches in the vaudeville Hill and you can go out to see Auschwitz and Birkenau the concentration cancers are very moving you go up to Gdansk in the very north and see that city it's beautiful Lublin come here and check out Warsaw and you can get around pretty easy don't worry about getting around I guess there'll be another one don't worry about getting around and Poland there's lots of buses and trains that go all over the place it is a big country so it does take time but don't be too worried about it anyway do some of the don'ts we have about Poland I actually have another don't video just for Krakow that don'ts of Krakow which I hope you'll check out if you do like videos like this we put out two travel videos every week every Wednesday and Saturday so please do click that subscribe button we really do appreciate it and you can always find us on Instagram Facebook Twitter obviously YouTube and we really appreciate those likes and subscriptions oh in comments so I'll say bye from Warsaw\",\n",
       " 'HI I\\'M RICK STEVES BACK WITH MORE OF THE BEST OF EUROPE. THIS TIME, WE\\'RE IN POLAND, WITH SUCH A RICH HISTORY\\nAND A PROMISING FUTURE.  DZIEN DOBRY.  DZIEN DOBRY. ITS UPS AND DOWNS, BUT POLAND HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY\\nHARD HIT THROUGH THE AGES. THANKFULLY, THESE ARE\\nGOOD TIMES FOR POLAND. IT\\'S A MEMBER\\nOF THE EUROPEAN UNION, ITS ECONOMY IS THRIVING, AND IT\\'S NEVER BEEN\\nMORE FUN TO VISIT. POLAND\\'S TWO MUST-SEE CITIES\\nARE WARSAW AND KRAKOW.   ENJOYING THE HIGHLIGHTS\\n OF POLAND,   WE\\'LL VISIT ITS GRAND\\n CULTURAL CENTER, KRAKOW;   MAKE A PILGRIMAGE\\n TO POLAND\\'S HOLIEST SIGHT;   REMEMBER THE HORRORS\\n OF AUSCHWITZ;   DESCEND INTO A MAGICAL\\n SALT MINE;   FEEL THE JAZZY BEAT;   BE INSPIRED\\n BY WORLD WAR II HEROICS;  SLAM DOWN A POLISH TRADITION... WHOA, YEAH!   ...AND EXPERIENCE THE PHOENIX\\n OF EUROPE, WARSAW.   IN THE NORTHEAST CORNER\\n OF EUROPE,   POLAND IS ONE OF THE LARGEST\\n COUNTRIES ON THE CONTINENT.   WE\\'LL VISIT ITS HISTORIC\\n CAPITAL, KRAKOW,   SIDE-TRIP TO A SALT MINE\\n AND TO A CONCENTRATION CAMP,   THEN HEAD FOR POLAND\\'S\\n MODERN CAPITAL, WARSAW. WE START IN KRAKOW. IT\\'S LIKE THE BOSTON OF POLAND,\\nA CHARMING AND VITAL CITY BUZZING WITH HISTORY,\\nCOLLEGE STUDENTS AND TOURISTS. EVEN THOUGH POLAND\\'S\\nPOLITICAL CAPITAL MOVED FROM HERE TO WARSAW\\n400 YEARS AGO, KRAKOW REMAINS THE COUNTRY\\'S CULTURAL\\nAND INTELLECTUAL CENTER.   THE CITY\\'S HISTORY IS RICH,\\n ITS SIGHTS ARE FASCINATING,   AND THE PRICES ARE SOME\\n OF EUROPE\\'S LOWEST.   THIS IS A COUNTRY\\n WHERE THE MOST EXPENSIVE CAFE   ON THE MOST EXPENSIVE PERCH   SERVES DRINKS FOR A FRACTION\\n OF WHAT YOU\\'D EXPECT.   THE CHARM OF TODAY\\'S KRAKOW\\n LIES IN ITS MEDIEVAL ROOTS. KRAKOW GREW WEALTHY FROM TRADE\\nIN THE 12th CENTURY. TRADERS PASSING THROUGH WERE\\nREQUIRED TO STOP FOR A FEW DAYS AND SELL THEIR GOODS\\nAT A DISCOUNT. LOCAL MERCHANTS THEN RESOLD\\nTHEIR WARES AT A PROFIT AND THE CITY THRIVED.  IN THE 13th CENTURY THE TARTARS\\n -- A.K.A. THE MONGOLS --   SWEPT IN FROM ASIA\\n AND DESTROYED KRAKOW.   RESILIENT KRAKOVIANS\\n TOOK THIS OPPORTUNITY   TO REBUILD THEIR CITY\\n WITH A NEAR-PERFECT GRID PLAN,   A STRIKING CONTRAST\\n TO THE NARROW, MAZE-LIKE LANES   OF MOST MEDIEVAL TOWNS. EVENTUALLY KRAKOW\\'S POWER WANED. WARSAW EMERGED\\nAS THE DOMINANT CITY IN POLAND AND KRAKOW BECAME\\nA PROVINCIAL BACKWATER OF THE HABSBURG EMPIRE\\nRULED FROM VIENNA. WHILE WARSAW WAS\\nIN THE SPHERE OF MOSCOW AND, THEREFORE, MORE EASTERN\\nAND CONSERVATIVE, KRAKOW HAS LONG BEEN\\nMORE WESTERN AND LIBERAL.   KRAKOW EMERGED FROM WORLD\\n WAR II VIRTUALLY UNSCATHED.   IT SLUMBERED UNDER COMMUNISM   UNTIL POLAND WON ITS FREEDOM\\n IN 1989.   TODAY, THE CITY IS POLAND\\'S\\n LEADING TOURIST ATTRACTION,   WITH PLENTY\\n OF TOP-NOTCH SIGHTS.   AFTER THE TARTARS\\n DESTROYED THEIR CITY,   KRAKOVIANS BUILT\\n THIS IMPOSING WALL.   THE BIG, ROUND DEFENSIVE FORT\\n STANDING OUTSIDE THE WALL   IS A BARBICAN.   IT PROVIDED EXTRA PROTECTION\\n AT THE TOWN\\'S MAIN GATE.   BY THE 19th CENTURY, THE CITY\\n WALL WAS NO LONGER NECESSARY.   LOCALS TORE DOWN MOST OF IT,\\n FILLED IN THE MOAT   AND PLANTED TREES.   TODAY, THIS DELIGHTFUL\\n AND PEOPLE-FRIENDLY GREENBELT,   A PARK CALLED THE PLANTY,\\n CIRCLES KRAKOW\\'S OLD TOWN.   TO GET AWAY\\n FROM THE TOURISTS\\' KRAKOW,   BIKE OR HIKE\\n AROUND THE PLANTY   AND UP THE PARK\\n THAT LINES THE VISTULA RIVER.   IF YOU THINK\\n YOU\\'RE GOOD AT CHESS,   CHALLENGE ONE OF THESE GUYS.   NEARBY, THE IMPOSING\\n ST. MARY\\'S CHURCH,  WITH ITS SOARING LOOKOUT TOWER,   HAS LONG BEEN AN ICON\\n OF THE CITY.   EACH MIDDAY, CROWDS GATHER\\n FOR A MEDIEVAL MOMENT   AS A NUN SWINGS OPEN   THE CHURCH\\'S MUCH-ADORED\\n ALTARPIECE.   THIS EXQUISITE\\n GOTHIC POLYPTYCH,   AN ALTARPIECE\\n WITH PIVOTING PANELS,   WAS CARVED IN THE LATE 1400s\\n BY VEIT STOSS.   ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE\\n MEDIEVAL WOOD CARVINGS   IN EXISTENCE, IT DEPICTS\\n THE DEATH OF THE VIRGIN   WITH EMOTION RARE\\n IN GOTHIC ART.   ST. MARY\\'S CHURCH\\n FACES KRAKOW\\'S   MARVELOUS MARKET SQUARE.   ONE OF EUROPE\\'S\\n MOST GASP-WORTHY PUBLIC SPACES,   IT BUSTLES WITH LIFE.   THIS SQUARE\\n IS WHERE KRAKOW LIVES.   KIDS PRACTICE BREAK DANCING,   HORSE CARRIAGES\\n TAKE YOU FOR A RIDE,   AND FOLK BANDS\\n ADD TRADITIONAL COLOR.  WHEN BUILT IN THE 13th CENTURY,   THIS WAS THE BIGGEST SQUARE\\n IN MEDIEVAL EUROPE.   BACK THEN YOU COULDN\\'T JUST\\n SELL THINGS ANYWHERE.  EVERYTHING HAD TO BE SOLD HERE,\\n ON THE MARKET SQUARE.   OR IN THE CLOTH HALL.   IN THE MIDDLE AGES,   THIS WAS WHERE\\n THE CLOTH SELLERS   HAD THEIR MARKET STALLS.   TODAY, WHETHER YOU\\'RE LOOKING\\n FOR A FANCY EGG,   SOME TRADITIONAL EMBROIDERY,   OR A LITTLE AMBER,   IT\\'S YOUR ONE-STOP\\n SOUVENIR SHOPPING ARCADE.   I FIND POLISH CULTURE\\n AND HISTORY   BOTH COMPELLING AND CONFUSING.   MY FRIEND AND FELLOW\\n TOUR GUIDE, KASIA DERLICKA,   IS JOINING US TO BE SURE\\n WE GET THINGS JUST RIGHT. LET\\'S GO TO A VERY\\nSPECIAL PLACE. IT\\'S CLOSE TO EVERY\\nPOLISH HEART. IT\\'S WAWEL, AND POLAND\\nACTUALLY BEGINS IN WAWEL.   WAWEL HILL IS SACRED GROUND\\n TO THE POLISH PEOPLE,   A SYMBOL OF POLISH ROYALTY\\n AND INDEPENDENCE.   A CASTLE HAS STOOD HERE\\n SINCE THE 11th CENTURY.   TODAY, WAWEL IS THE MOST\\n VISITED SIGHT IN ALL POLAND.   THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE ENTIRE\\n CASTLE COMPL   IS THE CATHEDRAL.   WAWEL CATHEDRAL IS POLAND\\'S\\n NATIONAL CHURCH,   ITS WESTMINSTER ABBY.   TO POLES, THIS CHURCH\\n IS THE NATIONAL MAUSOLEUM.  IT HOLDS THE TOMBS  OF POLAND\\'S GREATEST RULERS\\n AND HISTORIC FIGURES.  POLAND IS DEVOUTLY CATHOLIC.  SEVENTY-FIVE PERCENT\\n OF ITS NEARLY 40 MILLION PEOPLE  ARE PRACTICING CATHOLICS.  POPE JOHN PAUL II\\n WAS A HOMETOWN BOY  AND SERVED RIGHT HERE\\n AS ARCHBISHOP OF KRAKOW  BEFORE BEING CALLED TO ROME.  CATHOLICISM DEFINES THE POLES,  HOLDING THEM TOGETHER\\n WHEN NOTHING ELSE COULD. IMAGINE, POLAND WAS CRUNCHED BETWEEN PROTESTANT GERMANY\\nAND ORTHODOX RUSSIA. DURING THE PARTITION\\nIN THE 19th CENTURY, WE DIDN\\'T EVEN SHOW\\nON THE MAP, BUT WE SURVIVED, THANKS TO BEING POLISH AND\\nTHANKS TO BEING CATHOLICS. AND DURING COMMUNISM, IT WAS ALSO VERY DIFFICULT\\nAND VERY DARK, BUT WE EXPRESSED OUR FREEDOM\\nAND OUR POLITICAL DISSENT BY GOING TO MASS. COMPARED TO THE REST OF EUROPE,  POLISH CHURCHES ARE ALIVE WITH\\n PEOPLE PRACTICING THEIR FAITH.  RESPECTFUL TOURISTS\\n ARE WELCOME. SOME COME TO WORSHIP AND OTHERS\\n TO REMEMBER LEADING FIGURES  IN POLISH HISTORY,\\n SUCH AS KAZIMIERZ THE GREAT. IF YOU\\'RE GOING TO REMEMBER\\nONE POLISH KING, REMEMBER KAZIMIERZ THE GREAT, WHO RULED POLAND FROM KRAKOW\\nIN THE 14th CENTURY. KAZIMIERZ WAS ONE OF THOSE\\nLARGER-THAN-LIFE MEDIEVAL KINGS WHO LEFT HIS MARK\\nON ALL FRONTS. HE WAS A GREAT WARRIOR,\\nDIPLOMAT, PATRON OF THE ARTS,\\nAND WOMANIZER.  HIS SCRIBES BRAGGED KAZIMIERZ\\n FOUND POLAND MADE OF WOOD  AND LEFT IT\\n MADE OF BRICK AND STONE.  HE EVEN MADE IT\\n ONTO THE 50 ZLOTY NOTE. MOST OF ALL,\\nKAZIMIERZ WAS REMEMBERED FOR BEING A TOLERANT\\nAND PROGRESSIVE KING. IN THE 14th CENTURY, WHEN OTHER\\nNATIONS WERE DEPORTING JEWS, KING KAZIMIERZ\\nACTIVELY WELCOMED THEM. HE GRANTED THEM SPECIAL BANKING\\nAND TRADING PRIVILEGES AND ESTABLISHED\\nTHE LONG-STANDING TRADITION OF POLAND BEING A SAFE HAVEN\\nFOR JEWS IN EUROPE.  THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF KAZIMIERZ,\\n NAMED FOR THE KING,  WAS A THRIVING AND AUTONOMOUS\\n JEWISH COMMUNITY FOR CENTURIES  WHEN MOST OF THE WORLD\\'S JEWS\\n LIVED HERE IN POLAND.  IN THE 1930s, A QUARTER OF\\n KRAKOW\\'S POPULATION WAS JEWISH.  WHILE FEW JEWS\\n ACTUALLY STILL LIVE HERE,  THE SPIRIT OF THE JEWISH\\n TRADITION SURVIVES.  PERHAPS THE BEST WAY\\n TO ENJOY THAT  IS AT A KLEZMER\\n DINNER CONCERT. [ lively music playing ]  SEVERAL RESTAURANTS\\n OFFER JEWISH MUSIC  FROM 19th-CENTURY POLAND\\n WITH THEIR TRADITIONAL CUISINE.  AS POLISH AND JEWISH CULTURE\\n MINGLED HERE  FOR SO MANY CENTURIES,\\n IT\\'S HARD TO DISTINGUISH  BETWEEN JEWISH\\n AND POLISH CUISINE.  BUT WITH AMBIANCE LIKE THIS, IT\\'S CLEAR THAT JEWISH HERITAGE\\n HERE IS A RICH ONE. [ applause ] WHILE POLES AND JEWS MANAGED TO\\nLIVE TOGETHER RELATIVELY WELL, THE STORY BECAME A NIGHTMARE WITH THE RISE OF NAZISM\\nIN THE 1930s. THIS THRIVING JEWISH COMMUNITY,\\nLIKE MOST IN EUROPE, WAS DECIMATED\\nDURING THE HOLOCAUST.  THE FRAGILE REMAINS\\n OF THE COMMUNITY,  HISTORIC EXHIBITS\\n AND ITS SYNAGOGUES  PROVIDE A MEDITATIVE LOOK\\n AT HOW THE TOWN WAS WALLED IN  AND ITS RESIDENTS\\n EVENTUALLY SHIPPED OFF  TO NEARBY CONCENTRATIOCAMPS.  ULTIMATELY, LESS THAN 10%\\n OF KRAKOW\\'S JEWS  SURVIVED THE WAR\\n AND THE DEATH CAMPS.  THE JEWISH CEMETERIES\\n OF KAZIMIERZ  WERE DEFILED BY THE GERMANS,\\n BULLDOZED BY NAZI TANKS.  HEADSTONES,\\n BROKEN UNDER TANK TREADS, NOW CREATE A MOVING MOSAIC WALL\\n AND HOLOCAUST MONUMENT. BUT THE MOST POWERFUL\\nHOLOCAUST MEMORIAL, I THINK IN ALL OF EUROPE, IS THE CONCENTRATION CAMP\\nHERE AT AUSCHWITZ, AN HOUR\\'S DRIVE FROM KRAKOW.  AUSCHWITZ WAS THE BIGGEST\\n AND MOST NOTORIOUS  CONCENTRATION CAMP\\n IN THE NAZI SYSTEM.  SEEING THE CAMP\\n CAN BE DIFFICULT.  BUT AUSCHWITZ VICTIMS\\n AND THEIR FAMILIES  WANT TOURISTS TO COME HERE,\\n TO EXPERIENCE THE SCALE  AND THE MONSTROSITY\\n OF THE PLACE IN HUMAN TERMS,  IN HOPE THAT THE HOLOCAUST\\n WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN. THE NAZIS TURNED THIS ARMY BASE\\n INTO A DEATH CAMP. THEY MURDERED OVER FOUR MILLION\\n EUROPEAN JEWS IN POLAND.  OVER A MILLION PEOPLE,\\n THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM JEWS,  WERE SYSTEMICALLY EXTERMINATED\\n HERE AT AUSCHWITZ.  THE NOTORIOUS GATE WELCOMED\\n INMATES WITH A CRUEL LIE: \"Arbeit Macht Frei,\"\\n WORK WILL SET YOU FREE.  FORMER CELL BLOCKS\\n TELL THE STORY.  PEOPLE WERE TOLD\\n THEY\\'D BE STARTING NEW LIVES  AND TO BRING LUGGAGE, CLEARLY\\n LABELED WITH THEIR NAMES.  AFTER THEY WERE KILLED,  EVERYTHING OF VALUE\\n WAS SORTED AND WAREHOUSED.  EYEGLASSES EVOKE HOW\\n INDIVIDUALITY WAS TRASHED.  CRUTCHES AND PROSTHETIC LIMBS\\n REMIND US  THAT THE FIRST PEOPLE\\n EXTERMINATED  WERE MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY\\n ILL GERMAN CITIZENS.  CHILDREN\\'S CLOTHING;\\n THE NAZIS SPARED NO ONE.  AND A SEEMINGLY ENDLESS\\n MOUNTAIN OF SHOES.  IT\\'S HARD TO COMPREHEND\\n THE NUMBERS.  HALLS ARE LINED\\n WITHHOTOGRAPHS OF VICTIMS,  EACH MARKED WITH THE DATES\\n OF ARRIVAL AND DATES OF DEATH.  INMATES RARELY SURVIVED\\n MORE THAN A COUPLE OF MONTHS.  THE CREMATORIUM IS MARKED\\n BY ITS CHIMNEY.  UP TO 700 PEOPLE AT A TIME\\n COULD BE GASSED,  BUT IT REQUIRED TWO YS\\n TO BURN THAT MANY BODIES HERE.  THE NAZIS DIDN\\'T LIKE\\n THIS INEFFICIENCY, SO THEY BUILT A FAR BIGGER CAMP\\n TWO MILES AWAY.  AUSCHWITZ II, OR BIRKENAU,\\n WAS A VAST FACTORY OF DEATH,  HOLDING 100,000 PEOPLE.  A FEW BUILDINGS SURVIVE.  TRAIN TRACKS LED EFFICIENTLY\\n PAST THE MAIN BUILDING,  INTO THE CAMP,\\n AND TO THE DIVIDING PLATFORM. AND EVALUATED EACH PRISONER AS THEY STEPPED OFF THE TRAIN. IF HE POINTED TO THE RIGHT,\\nTHE PRISONER MARCHED UNKNOWINGLY\\nDIRECTLY TO THE GAS CHAMBER. IF HE POINTED TO THE LEFT, THE PERSON WAS JUDGED\\nSTRONG ENOUGH TO WORK AND WOULD LIVE A LITTLE LONGER. IT WAS HERE THAT FAMILIES\\nFROM ALL OVER EUROPE WERE TORN APART FOREVER.  UP TO A THOUSAND WERE PACKED\\n INTO EACH OF THESE BUILDINGS.  EACH INMATE HAD AN ID NUMBER,  A BARRACK NUMBER\\n AND A BED NUMBER.  TWO CHIMNEYS\\n CONNECTED BY A BRICK DUCT   PROVIDED A LITTLE HEAT. THE BRICKS ARE WORN SMOOTH\\nBY COUNTLESS INMATES WHO SAT HERE\\nTO CATCH A LITTLE WARMTH IN THE MIDDLE\\nOF A BITTER POLISH WINTER. I CAN\\'T IMAGINE\\nHOW COLD THEY MUST HAVE BEEN, WET, HUNGRY\\nAND DRESSED IN RAGS.  THE GERMANS BOMBED\\n THE SPRAWLING GASSING  AND CREMATION FACILITIES\\n AS THEY RETREATED.  THE RUINS STAND AS A MEMORIAL.  THE GAS CHAMBERS, WHERE\\n THE MASS KILLING WAS DONE,  WERE DISGUISED AS SHOWERS.  PEOPLE WERE GIVEN\\n NUMBERED HOOKS  TO HANG THEIR CLOTHES ON,  CONNED INTO THINKING\\n THEY WERE COMING BACK.  THE NAZIS DIDN\\'T WANT A PANIC.  THEN INMATES WERE PILED\\n INTO THE SHOWER ROOM.  AT BIRKENAU, THE NAZIS\\n GASSED AND CREMATED  OVER 4,000 PEOPLE PER DAY.  THE CAMP MONUMENT\\n REPRESENTS GRAVESTONES  AND THE CHIMNEY\\n OF A CREMATORIUM.  PLAQUES, IN EACH\\n OF THE LANGUAGES SPOKEN  BY CAMP VICTIMS, EXPLAINED\\n THE PURPOSE OF THIS MEMORIAL. THE MEMORIAL READS, \"A CRY OF DESPAIR\\nAND A WARNING TO HUMANITY.\" SINCE LIBERATION DAY IN 1945, MILLIONS HAVE VISITED\\nTHIS PLACE. HOPEFULLY, THEY TAKE AWAY\\nA DETERMINATION TO LEARN FROM THE HOLOCAUST\\nAND NEVER LET IT BE REPEATED. DRIVING THROUGH THE COUNTRYSIDE\\n BACK TO KRAKOW REFRESHES TRAVELERS WITH A LOOK  AT TODAY\\'S PEACEFUL,\\n RURAL POLAND.  FEW TRAVELERS TAKE TIME\\n TO SEE THE COUNTRYSIDE.  STOP THE CAR, GET OUT,\\n ENJOY AN INTIMATE LOOK  AT POLAND\\'S WELCOMING\\n COUNTRY LIFE.  THE SMALL HOUSES\\n ARE TRADITIONALLY USED  BY THREE GENERATIONS\\n AT THE SAME TIME.  NINETEENTH-CENTURY HOUSES,\\n THE FEW THAT SURVIVE,  OFTEN SPORT COLORFUL STRIPES.  BACK THEN, PARENTS ANNOUNCED\\n THAT THEIR DAUGHTERS  WERE NOW ELIGIBLE\\n BY GETTING OUT THE PAINT. ONCE THEY SAW THESE BLUE LINES,  VILLAGE BOYS WERE WELCOME\\n TO COME A-COURTIN\\'.  THE REMARKABLE WIELICZKA SALT\\n MINE, JUST OUTSIDE OF KRAKOW,  HAS BEEN PRODUCING SALT\\n FOR EIGHT CENTURIES.  TODAY, IT\\'S BUSY NOT\\n WITH MINERS, BUT WITH TOURISTS.  AFTER DESCENDING 200 FEET\\n BELOW THE SURFACE,  YOU FOLLOW YOUR GUIDE\\n ON A MILE-LONG DOWNHILL STROLL,  GETTING A MEMORABLE PEEK\\n AT LIFE IN THE MINE.

BACK IN THE 1950s,  JANUSZ MUNIAK WAS ONE OF THE\\n ORIGINAL POLISH HEP CATS.  NOW HE OWNS THE JAZZ CLUB\\n U MUNIAKA  AND JAMS REGULARLY HERE\\n IN A MELLOW CELLAR.  AND JAMS REGULARLY HERE\\n IN A MELLOW CELLAR.  AFTER A THREE-HOUR TRAIN RIDE\\n FROM KRAKOW,  WE ARRIVE IN WARSAW.  WARSAW, PRONOUNCED VAR-SHA-VA\\n IN POLISH,  IS POLAND\\'S CAPITAL\\n AND BIGGEST CITY.  ITS OUTSKIRTS SPRAWL  WITH COMMUNIST-BUILT\\n APARTMENT BLOCKS.  DOWNTOWN HAS A GOTHAM-CITY\\n AMBIANCE, WITH BUSY BOULEVARDS,  EXPANSIVE SQUARES\\n AND BLOCKY BUILDINGS.  THE PALACE OF CULTURE\\n AND SCIENCE,  POLAND\\'S TALLEST BUILDING\\n AT OVER 700 FEET,  IS A WARSAW LANDMARK.  IT WAS A GIFT FROM STALIN\\n IN THE 1950s  THAT THE PEOPLE OF WARSAW\\n COULDN\\'T REFUSE. BECAUSE IT WAS TO BE SOVIET IN\\nSUBSTANCE AND POLISH IN STYLE, SOVIET ARCHITECTS\\nACTUALLY TOURED POLAND TO ABSORB THE LOCAL CULTURE\\nBEFORE STARTING THE PROJECT.  TO SHOW THEIR \"GRATITUDE,\"  THE PEOPLE OF WARSAW\\n NICKNAMED IT \"STALIN\\'S PENIS.\"  AND NESTLED IN THE CENTER OF\\n ALL THIS UTILITARIAN CONCRETE  ARE PLENTY OF URBAN CHARMS.  WARSAW\\'S ROYAL WAY,  A MOSTLY BUSES-AND-TAXIS-ONLY\\n SHOPPING BOULEVARD,  IS A LOCAL FAVORITE\\n FOR STROLLING AND BROWSING...  AND ULTIMATELY LEADS YOU\\n TO WARSAW\\'S HISTORIC OLD TOWN.  THE CASTLE LONG SERVED\\n AS A ROYAL PALACE.  SIGISMUND III, THE GREAT KING\\n WHO MOVED POLAND\\'S CAPITAL  FROM KRAKOW TO WARSAW IN 1596,\\n STANDS OVERSEEING EVERYTHING.  AND THE CITY\\'S LEGENDARY\\n MERMAID WELCOMES FRIENDS  WHILE KEEPING OUT FOES. THE GRAND CITY OF WARSAW\\nEXPERIENCED MORE THAN ITS SHARE OF HARDSHIPS\\nIN THE 20th CENTURY. AS WITH THE REST OF POLAND, THE REAL TRAGEDIES CAME\\nWITH THE NAZIS AND WORLD WAR II. DURING THE NAZI OCCUPATION,\\nTHERE WERE TWO HEROIC UPRISINGS. FIRST, THE JEWISH\\nGHETTO UPRISING; THEN, ABOUT A YEAR LATER,\\nTHE ENTIRE CITY ROSE UP AGAINST THE NAZIS\\nIN THE WARSAW UPRISING.  SEVERAL POWERFUL MUSEUMS ARE\\n DEDICATED TO TELLING THE STORY.  BY THE 1930s, WARSAW,\\n WITH 350,000 JEWS,  WAS ONE OF THE LARGEST\\n JEWISH CITIES IN THE WORLD.  THE NAZIS ARRIVED IN 1939.  THEY CRAMMED WARSAW\\'S JEWS\\n INTO A SINGLE NEIGHBORHOOD  AND SURROUNDED IT\\n WITH A WALL.  AS MORE JEWISH PEOPLE WERE\\n MOVED IN FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE,  WARSAW\\'S GHETTO WAS SOON\\n THE MISERABLE HOME  OF WELL OVER A MILLION PEOPLE. BY 1942, HALF OF THE JEWS\\nIN THE GHETTO HAD DIED OF DISEASE\\nOR STARVATION. THE NAZIS BEGAN MOVING PEOPLE\\nOUT AT THE RATE OF 5,000 A DAY TO NEARBY DEATH CAMPS\\nLIKE AUSCHWITZ. THE POPULATION OF THE GHETTO\\nWAS DOWN TO ABOUT 60,000 WHEN THOSE WHO REMAINED\\nREALIZED THEY WOULD DIE EVEN IF THEY DID NOTHING. THEY DECIDED TO STAGE\\nA COURAGEOUS UPRISING.  HOPELESSLY OUTGUNNED\\n BY THE NAZIS,  THE UPRISING WAS CRUSHED...  THE GHETTO WAS DEMOLISHED...  AND ITS RESIDENTS WERE KILLED.  BECAUSE OF THE FEROCITY\\n OF NAZI HATRED,  NOTHING REMAINS OF THE GHETTO\\n EXCEPT THE STREET PLAN  AND THE HEROIC SPIRIT OF THE\\n PEOPLE WHO ONCE LIVED HERE.  GHETTO HEROES SQUARE,  NOW SURROUNDED BY BLAND\\n SOVIET-STYLE APARTMENT BLOCKS,  MARKS THE HEART OF WHAT WAS\\n THE JEWISH GHETTO. THE MONUMENT COMMEMORATES THOSE\\n WHO FOUGHT AND DIED  FOR THE DIGNITY AND FREEDOM\\n OF THE JEWISH NATION,  FOR A FREE POLAND, AND FOR THE\\n LIBERATION OF HUMANKIND. ABOUT A YEAR LATER, THE REST OF THE CITY STAGED\\nANOTHER ILL-FATED UPRISING, THE WARSAW UPRISING. BY 1944, AS THE SOVIET ARMY\\nDREW NEAR, IT WAS BECOMING CLEAR THE NAZIS\\' DAYS IN WARSAW\\nWERE NUMBERED. WITH THE EXPECTATION OF HELP\\nFROM SOVIET TANKS WHICH WERE GATHERING\\nJUST ACROSS THE RIVER, IT SEEMED LIKE THE RIGHT TIME\\nTO ATTACK.  THIS MONUMENT RECALLS  THE 50,000 POLISH\\n RESISTANCE FIGHTERS,  THE BIGGEST UNDERGROUND ARMY\\n IN MILITARY HISTORY,  WHO LAUNCHED A SURPRISE ATTACK\\n ON THEIR NAZI OPPRESSORS.  THEY POURED OUT AT THE SEWERS\\n AND CAUGHT THE NAZIS OFF-GUARD, INITIALLY HAVING GREAT SUCCESS.  IT WAS RIFLES, KNIVES\\n AND MOLOTOV COCKTAILS  AGAINST AIR FORCE, TANKS\\n AND ARTILLERY  AS THEY BATTLED COURAGEOUSLY\\n FOR 63 DAYS.  BUT THE NAZIS REGROUPED  AND BRUTALLY PUT DOWN\\n THE WARSAW UPRISING.  A QUARTER OF A MILLION POLES\\n WERE KILLED. THROUGH ALL THIS, THE SOVIETS\\nSAT HERE, ACROSS THE RIVER. THEY WATCHED AND WAITED. AS THE SMOKE CLEARED\\nAND THE NAZIS RETREATED, THE RED ARMY MARCHED IN AND CLAIMED THE PILE OF RUBBLE\\nTHAT WAS ONCE WARSAW.  TO ME,\\n THE THRIVING CITY ITSELF  IS THE BEST MEMORIAL\\n TO THOSE WARSAW HEROES.  TODAY, AS YOU EXPLORE, IT\\'S\\n HARD TO IMAGINE THAT BY 1945, NEARLY TWO-THIRDS OF THE CITY\\'S\\n PREWAR POPULATION WAS DEAD AND NOT A BUILDING WAS STANDING\\n IN WARSAW\\'S OLD TOWN.  VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING YOU SEE\\n IS REBUILT.  BEFORE THE WAR,\\n WARSAW\\'S OLD TOWN SQUARE  WAS ONE OF THE MOST HAPPENING\\n SPOTS IN CENTRAL EUROPE.  AND TODAY, EVEN\\n THE HIGGLEDY-PIGGLEDY CHARM  OF THE BUILDINGS HAS BEEN\\n PAINSTAKINGLY RESTORED.  THE COLORFUL ARCHITECTURE  REMINDS LOCALS AND TOURISTS\\n ALIKE  OF THE PREWAR GLORY\\n OF THE POLISH CAPITAL. THE OLD TOWN\\'S MANY RESTAURANTS  PROVIDE A GOOD INTRODUCTION\\n TO POLISH CUISINE,  AND CENTRAL TO THAT\\n IS VODKA.  VODKA, AFTER IT\\'S CHILLED\\n PROPERLY,  POURS THICKLY INTO THE GLASS.  WE\\'RE HAVING SOME TRADITIONAL\\n POLISH DISHES  THAT GO WELL WITH VODKA:  HERRING, COLD CUTS, POLISH\\n PICKLES AND STEAK TARTARE. SO VODKA HAS LONG BEEN\\nPART OF POLISH CULTURE? YES, IT\\'S A TRADITIONAL\\nPOLISH DRINK. AND ACTUALLY IT MAKES\\nA LOT OF SENSE. IN THE OLD DAYS, WHEN THE WINTERS WERE\\nLONG AND VERY COLD, WE NEEDED IT. IT WAS OUR WARM-UP. IT WAS ESSENTIAL TO\\nSURVIVE THIS HARSH CLIMATE. [ chuckling ] DO YOU KNOW HOW\\nTO DRINK VODKA? SHOW ME. OKAY. FIRST OF ALL,\\n Na zdrowie.  Na zdrowie.  Na zdrowie. AND PLEASE\\nDON\\'T SIP IT.

       " 'Is Wagner going to attack Poland? That is a question now, that many people are\\nasking. And definitely there are things going on there\\non the border between Belarus and Poland. So let\\'s talk about it. For a while there has been more and more talk\\nabout a possible confrontation between Wagner forces in Belarus and NATO. And I think this has been fueled by three\\ndifferent things. First there is the fact that Wagner is now\\ndeploying to Belarus. This is happening after the Wagner coup that\\nhappened in June, and frankly it\\'s still kind of hard to figure out what\\'s going on. Where these Wagner soldiers are going, how\\nmany are there, and what they are doing? But they are beginning to show up in Belarus\\nin larger numbers, and they do seem to be placed in camps that are located close to\\nPoland and Lithuania. The second thing is that Putin and Lukashenko\\nhas been talking about a confrontation with Poland. Putin said that Poland has secret plans to\\nattack Ukraine and Belarus to restore a historic Polish empire, and he said that if they attack\\nBelarus, then Russia will defend their partner. This sounds crazy, but it is the kind of words\\nthat get people thinking about whether Russia is planning a false flag attack on themselves\\nto get an excuse for going to war with Poland. And Lukashenko has said something similar,\\nand then he also made some comments about how the Wagner soldiers really want to get\\ninto a war with Poland. Because Poland has supported Ukraine so much\\nduring the war, and the Wagner soldiers suffered around Bakhmut because of that assistance\\nfrom Poland. So they want revenge. So according to Putin and Lukashenko, Poland\\nis both a very strong supporter of Ukraine and they are also planning an invasion of\\nUkraine. It doesn\\'t really make any sense, but it does\\nat a rhetorical level drive up some tensions with Poland. And the third thing is that the Polish government\\nhas deployed more soldiers to the border areas. This has also contributed to the impression\\nthat something might happen. And especially there has been concern that\\nWagner might do some hybrid warfare things in the so-called Suwalki Gap. The Suwalki Gap is the small piece of land\\nbetween Kaliningrad and Belarus. It is a border region between Poland and Lithuania,\\nso the territory there is Polish and Lithuanian. Suwalki is the name of a Polish city, so that\\nis where the name \"the Suwalki Gap\" comes from. It is about 70 kilometers long, and it is\\none of the areas that we always talk about when there is a discussion about a possible\\nwar between Russia and NATO. Because the assumption is that Russia will\\ntry to take this area to create a land corridor to Kaliningrad. So now there is a discussion about whether\\nWagner can maybe do some things here. I don\\'t really think this is likely, but I\\nwant to address the question in a couple of steps. The first one is that I think it\\'s very clear\\nthat Russia does not want a direct war with NATO at this point. They have already committed more or less everything\\nthey have in Ukraine, and they don\\'t have the resources to also fight a war with NATO\\nin Belarus. So Russia would not want this Wagner thing\\nto escalate into a real war with Poland. So that means that whatever Wagner could do\\nin the Suwalki Gap, it would have to be some kind of hybrid warfare thing. Hybrid warfare is actions that take place\\nin the greyzone below the threshold of actual war. And then you typically combine different types\\nof military and non-military measures to target vulnerabilities in the country you are attacking. So people have suggested that maybe Wagner\\ncan do some of the same things that happened in Crimea or in Eastern Ukraine in 2014, where\\nthe so-called little green men showed up and started to make trouble, and nobody could\\nprove who they were. I don\\'t think this reference to 2014 works\\nparticularly well for two reasons. First, it would not come as a surprise. The Polish and Lithuanian authorities would\\nhave a pretty good idea about what to do if an armed group of Russian speaking men suddenly\\nshow up and start making trouble. They have thought about this scenario. And second, there is not really any popular\\nsupport that the Wagner soldiers could plug into in the Suwalki Gap. In Ukraine in 2014 there was after all a significant\\npart of the population that was concerned about the Maidan revolution, and that were\\nsupportive of the idea of being a part of Russia. But that is not the case in the Suwalki Gap. So if Wagner fighters show up there, then\\nit\\'s pretty much just them, and the population will be against them. So it would be a hopeless mission. It\\'s maybe also worth talking about how the\\nPolish and Lithuanian authorities may react to hybrid attacks. I think there are two kinds of reaction depending\\non how serious the attack is. The first one is what I think we can call\\nthe NATO standard procedure for these things during the war in Ukraine, and that is to\\njust ignore it. It sounds a bit strange, but it actually makes\\na lot of sense. The Western countries feel that they have\\na winning strategy by helping Ukraine fight the war, and Russian hybrid attacks are intended\\nto undermine the will to support Ukraine. I made a longer video about this if you are\\ninterested. But instead of making a big deal out of the\\nhybrid attacks, the Western countries just pretend it didn\\'t happen so they can continue\\nwinning the war. For example the other day two Belarusian helicopters\\nviolated Polish airspace. These were not Wagner helicopters but regular\\nBelarusian armed forces. The first thing the Polish government did\\nwas to deny that anything had happened. Then people started posting pictures on social\\nmedia of the helicopters over a Polish city, so the government changed the story and came\\nout with some angry statements. My guess is in the coming days they are probably\\ngoing to just stop talking about it, so it will slip out of the media picture. My point is that NATO and the West are going\\nto do absolutely nothing about these things as long as they can ignore it, and it\\'s not\\ntoo serious. Then if something happens that is bigger than\\nthis, if for example Wagner starts making real attacks across the border, then we are\\ngoing to see the exact opposite approach. Because that is the lesson that Eastern European\\ncountries learned from the events in 2014. That the way to deal with the uncertainty\\nof grey zone activity is to escalate your way out of the grey zone. So if Wagner suddenly shows up in Poland and\\nstart making trouble, then I think the Polish military will go all-in. Because that would force Russia and Belarus\\nto go beyond the ambiguity. Do they want a real war or not? And as I said before, Russia and Belarus do\\nnot want a real war with NATO. So those are the two steps in the Western\\nresponse to Russian hybrid warfare. If it is a minor attack or a violation of\\nsome kind, then they are going to ignore it. And if it is a big hybrid attack with armed\\nforces, then the Polish and Lithuanian response will be to escalate things rapidly, so we\\ndon\\'t have a murky grey zone. So that is why I think it is extremely unlikely\\nthat Wagner will attack Poland. It just wouldn\\'t make any sense. They would be absolutely destroyed, and Russia\\nwould not come and help them. So what is Wagner doing? Well, it\\'s pretty confusing. Just six weeks ago they made a mutiny in Russia,\\nbut it looks like Putin has been unable to get rid of Wagner because they are too important\\nfor Russia\\'s foreign policy in Africa. So it looks like Wagner for the time being\\nis allowed to continue to exist and function, although they have been forced to hand over\\na lot of their heavy equipment like tanks and infantry fighting vehicles to the Russian\\nMinistry of Defense. But I also think this has got to be a short\\nterm thing. It must be a goal for Putin to replace Wagner\\nwith other companies that are under the control of someone that he can trust. And then when Wagner becomes less important,\\nthen Putin can deal with Prigozhin in a way that is suitable for a traitor. Because that is what Prigozhin is from Putin\\'s\\nperspective. And obviously Prigozhin knows this, so I think\\nwe should expect him to be doing things to avoid this from happening. So where I want to go with this is that I\\nthink we should probably not assume that Wagner and the Russian government are working closely\\ntogether, or that they share common goals. And also I think that if Wagner is going to\\nattack another country from the territory of Belarus, then the most likely country to\\nattack not Poland or Ukraine. I think it is much more likely that we will\\nsee another drive at Moscow if they get the chance. It would be a good survival strategy for Prigozhin\\nto get rid of Putin. So maybe we can put it this way: If Wagner\\nattack Poland – or Ukraine for that matter – from Belarus, then that is suicide. They would be absolutely destroyed. But if they attack Russia, then under the\\nright circumstances that can be a good survival strategy. So when we see the Wagner soldiers now being\\nwhere they are in Belarus then that might also be a point. Yes, it is right up along the Polish border,\\nand that gives Wagner some opportunities to look like they are doing something important\\nfor Russia. But it is also as far away as possible from\\nthe Russian border, so it\\'s harder for them to make another surprise mutiny. So that may be one of the ways that Putin\\nis trying to deal with this situation. But I don\\'t think Wagner is going to attack\\nPoland. Ok, I will end it here.

       " '[narrator] All year round, Poland\\'s flora and fauna\\nare full of surprises. From the mountains of the Tatra\\nin the south to one of the largest swamp regions\\nin Europe. From the stork country of Masuria to the desert-like dunes\\nof the Baltic coast. A country which still has enough space\\nfor unique wildlife, ancient, cultivated landscapes and people who foster old traditions. The mountains are still\\nin the grip of winter. To the south,\\npeaks up to 2,500 meters high dominate Poland. Icy winds lash the ridges of the Tatra, part of the Carpathian belt and the smallest area of high mountains\\nin the world. The nutcracker is at home\\nin the pine forests and is at the moment\\nliving on the stores of food it hid in the ground in autumn. As good as invisible, the lynx. The roof of Poland, parts of which\\nare still untouched by human contact. A mountain world of austere beauty. Few animals manage to brave\\nthe icy East Polish winter. Bison are protected by their thick,\\nshaggy coats. These mighty descendants of ancient cattle have adapted to the harsh climate\\nover thousands of years. They found a new home\\non the border to Belarus. Originally spread\\nover the whole continent, Europe\\'s largest land mammal\\nwas hunted almost to extinction. The last bison in Poland\\nwas killed in 1919, and a few years later, the species was completely extinct\\nin the wild. 60 years ago,\\nthe first bison were released again. All the specimens living today are descendants of 12 captive animals. More than 500 of these powerful beasts now populate the east of Poland. They tend to avoid the company of humans. The long winters in Poland\\nare relentless. The remains of sick or injured animals that don\\'t make it through the cold season attract scavengers,\\nthus ensuring their survival. At the moment, the foxes\\nare more preoccupied with themselves. The ravens hastily gulp down\\nwhat they can get. Cautiously,\\nthe fox checks out the situation, even though, in reality, it is the stronger animal. But the magpies know\\nhow to keep the fox distracted. By pecking its tail, for instance. [magpie cawing] An icy idyll, the countryside\\nis still in its winter torpor, with daytime temperatures between -20° and -30°C. The Continental winter\\nmakes heavy demands on humans, too. Once a week, the farmer\\nfetches hay for his horses, which even today are indispensable. [man speaking Polish] [man speaking Polish] Life out here is simple. Those still living on the land\\nhave learned to adapt. For a country with economic aspirations, some parts of Poland\\nseem to be caught in a time warp. But there are still people living here who follow ancient traditions. [man mutters] At last, the first signs that winter is coming to a close. The lowland rivers Biebrza and Narew break up and start to flow again. But the ice and frost are tenacious and don\\'t give up that easily. The beaver knows how to deal\\nwith such wintry conditions, at least most of the time. Let\\'s have another go. The morning\\'s hygiene routine can begin. 23,000 hairs per square centimeter make for fantastic insulation\\nif you look after them. Castor, a fatty bodily secretion, protects the large rodent\\nfrom moisture and chills. The beaver\\'s neighbors\\nare a mother otter and her two almost adult offspring. Playful and extremely agile, otters need around\\n15% of their body weight in food every day. The mother looks after her young\\nfor a good year. Then comes the parting of the ways. Day by day, more ice thaws\\non the Biebrza and Narew rivers. Huge quantities of meltwater are released, causing the lowland rivers\\nto overflow their banks. Colorful blooms at last, wood anemones and liverwort. Moor frogs provide the first splashes\\nof color in the animal world. During the spawning period\\nin shallow ponds, the males sport a discreet shade of blue to attract females\\nand warn off other males. The flooded areas on the Narew and its tributary, the Biebrza, are increasing by the day, half water, half land, wild and untamed. Spring in one of Europe\\'s largest regions of natural swampland. During the night,\\nmore migratory birds have arrived. This ornithological paradise\\nis beginning to fill up. More than 180 kinds of bird nest here and seek protection from predators\\nand humans in the swampy landscape. There\\'s room for both everyday species, like the raucous black-headed gulls, and rarities like\\nthe imposing great white egrets, whose numbers are growing year by year. The biggest bird in the region\\nis the mute swan. Like most of the other birds here, it spends most of its time feeding. Apart from the occasional bout of posing. The wealth of insect life\\non the marsh marigolds carpeting the area attracts flocks of black-headed gulls. This stork is looking\\nfor something bigger. The toads\\' mating cries\\nhave given them away. But the stork only wants\\nto snack on a few leeches. Even the starling,\\nanything but a waterfowl, enjoys a bath in the Biebrza. [birds tweeting] Every day, new species arrive in Poland\\'s Amazonia. The ruffs are among the last, back from spending the winter\\nin the dry Sahel region of Africa. The males are resplendent\\nin their mating plumage. No two look alike,\\nan achievement in itself. There are few species of bird where the show is quite so important. Each male seems more attractive\\nthan the last. Full of nervous excitement, they present themselves\\nto the hens in the mating area. In the ruff world,\\nit\\'s the females that get to choose. But the rivals aren\\'t content\\nto have their fate decided on looks alone. [birds squawking] With powerful wing beats, well-aimed kicks and stabs of the beak, the males aren\\'t afraid\\nto use all the weapons at their disposal. A bit of \"ruff house\", as it were. Poland\\'s largest national park on the Biebrza covers\\n600 square kilometers. Settlement was never an issue. Here and there,\\nthe landscape is dotted with farms. Working the fields the traditional way. The people that live here have a deep-rooted relationship\\nwith the countryside. They\\'re closely attached\\nto their livestock and are content with what the land\\nand their farm yield. They sustain the old cultivated landscape and provide for themselves\\nand their animals, summer and winter. A modest existence,\\nbut an unhurried one. Some undomesticated wildlife follow humans into their settlements. Sparrows are a typical example. The track left by the cattle\\nis the perfect place for a sand bath. The slow motion replay reveals just how thorough and skillful\\nthe sparrows toilette is, as it both cleans and gets rid of parasites\\nin their plumage. And is obviously not just hard work. [birds tweeting] [dog barks] The working day begins\\nat the Florianka Stables. Here, the focus is on ponies, on koniks, to be exact. [man shouting in Polish] [man speaks in Polish] [dog barking] Gradually,\\nthe horses are familiarized with humans and trained for various duties. Hard work. Koniks weren\\'t born to jump, but to run. [dog barking] The konik, or little horse, is a race of pony from\\nCentral and Eastern Europe, small but surprisingly powerful\\nand lively. In Poland, the land of horses, stables have a long tradition. Florianka is still relatively new, having been founded in 1995. The aim of the stables\\nis to re-breed koniks, wild horses which died out in the wild\\nin the 18th century. [dog barks] Koniks are known\\nfor their undemanding nature, longevity and above all robustness, making them ideal working animals. The ponies could live outside\\nall year round, but in Florianka they\\'re brought inside\\nin the evening. Back in the watery world\\nof the Biebrza and the Narew. At this time of year,\\nthe swamps are full of life. White-winged black terns out hunting. The terns hover flight enables them to keep both a look out for water insects and an eye on their eggs. Their nests are inconspicuous, but the decisive aspect here\\nis the fact that they float. A crane crosses the swamp\\nin search of a bite to eat. But anyone who gets too close\\nto the terns\\' nests can also lose their poise. Whiskered terns brooding. Many species in the swamps\\nbreed in loose colonies, which provide a certain security, including black-necked grebes. Their nests are also rafts\\nof rotting plant remains which are unaffected\\nby changing water levels. Glowing red eyes and bronze ear tufts are their characteristics. In the swamp, the best survival strategy is to get on your own two feet\\nas quickly as possible. A few hours ago,\\nthis little crane was still in its egg. A soon as its siblings hatches, the family will undertake\\ntheir first excursion in the swamp. The black-necked grebes\\nand whiskered terns have also produced offspring. The tiny grebe chicks can already leave their floating home by themselves, but only do so\\nwhen the temptation is great enough. Every year, according to water levels, Biebrza and Narew give the countryside\\na new face. Two rivers that are still allowed\\nto make their own way. Damsel flies. Dragonfly wings don\\'t beat synchronously, which enables them to hover, accelerate in a flash and land with absolute precision, like this demoiselle. [dog barks, cow moos] The wildlife has adapted\\nto the changing water levels, as have the cattle\\nfrom the village of Brzostowo. The way it\\'s been for centuries. Today, the cows are leaving their shed for the first time this year. Various farmers drive their stock together to the nearby Biebrza. Stoic and placid, the cows wade through the river. Today, they\\'re accompanied, but in future they\\'ll make their own way. Hatching time for the meadow birds\\nis over. Now the cattle can enjoy the lush pasture and are eagerly awaited. [cow moos] The cows keep the vegetation short. This natural form of agriculture benefits birds like\\nthe black-tailed godwit and many other animals. To the north of the swamp region\\nlie Warmia and Masuria... extensive forests\\nand Poland\\'s biggest lake district. The numerous farms are evidence\\nof intact agriculture. The numerous storks of intact flora and fauna. \"One in four storks is a Pole,\"\\nthe locals say with pride, as 25% of the world\\'s stork population of 50,000 breed in Poland, on top of church towers,\\nbarns and farmhouses. [storks clattering] The birds\\' distinctive clattering\\nis both a greeting and serves to strengthen the bond\\nbetween partners. According to popular belief here, white storks symbolize good luck\\nand parental care and are responsible\\nfor bringing human babies. Wherever storks live, nature and agriculture\\nare still in harmony and there\\'s food in abundance. [tractor engines] Thus storks also profit from humans. Spotted susliks too. The little rodents inhabit open spaces, here created by the farmer\\'s mowing. Susliks live in family groups and spend most of the time\\nlooking for food or eating. They like cereals and grasses. They spotted the stork some time ago and are keeping a look out. [souslik whistles] A shrill whistle serves as\\na warning signal. [souslik whistles] But the stork is a safe distance away. Time for some reciprocal preening. Susliks have underground burrows, into which they can disappear instantly at the first sign of danger. The stork is usually too late. But storks possess a quality\\nsadly lacking in susliks. They have patience, infinite patience. Susliks are only found\\nin certain parts of Poland, maybe as a consequence\\nof the large stork population and their successful hunting strategy. Summer in Masuria. Poppies and cornflowers are\\na regular feature and their colorful blooms\\nattract countless insects. Many animals profit from the wealth\\nof six-legged life, like the hoopoe. Its young are fed a steady stream of crickets and other insects. The roller is as colorful\\nas a tropical bird, and rarely seen in Poland. Like the hoopoe, it loves a warm climate and is always on the look out\\nfor larger insects. [bird squawking] Its qualities as a singer, however, are somewhat limited. Rollers can impress by their looks alone. The hoopoe\\'s characteristic call can be heard some distance away. [bird tweeting] On the edge of the field\\nlive a family of foxes. The vixen is always on guard but her cubs have other concerns, like getting their mother to suckle them. This phase lasts six weeks. And when Mum goes off to find food, it\\'s time for some fun. [pups squealing] The cubs use all of the sand hill to mock fight and scrap. [pups yelping] They leave the den for the first time\\naged three weeks, then slowly increase\\ntheir radius of activity. For the moment, their world is just one big adventure playground. Masuria\\'s forests stretch to the horizon. Peaceful and remote. Remote enough for a bird that seeks as little contact with humans as possible, the black stork. In stark contrast\\nto their white relatives, black storks lead hidden lives, high up in the trees. But like their white cousins, they reuse their nests for years. These rare birds feel at home in rich,\\nnatural woodlands bordered by streams and rivers, which Masuria has in abundance. Next door, a young white-backed woodpecker clamors for food. These birds are typical inhabitants\\nof the Russian Taiga, their main area of closed distribution, whose western tip lies in Poland. Feeding time at the black stork\\'s nest. 1,000 pairs live in Poland, the largest population in Europe. [bird tweets] The young white-backed woodpecker\\nis almost ready to leave the nest. [birds tweeting] [storks squawking] The young black storks\\nstill have some way to go. In comparison to their white cousins, black storks clatter very quietly, but have a larger repertoire of other calls and quiet songs. [storks tweeting] Leaving Masuria, in the north of Poland, the forests extend right up to the Baltic Contrasts, lush green up to the seaside, and large dead trees suffocated by sand. Wandering sand dunes over 40 meters high are a constant threat to the forests in the Slovinski National Park. Poland\\'s Sahara, 330 square kilometers\\nof desert-like dunes, always on the move. The sand comes from the sea\\nand is banked up and transported by the westerly winds. Creatures that live here\\nleave no tracks. The sand is constantly resupplied\\nby the Baltic. Quietly, almost unnoticed, the sea keeps Poland\\'s desert alive. Morning mist inland. Summer is drawing to a close. [deer roaring] Loud roaring\\ncoming from a forest clearing can only mean one thing, it\\'s mating time for the red deer. The younger animals have no part to play. [deer roaring] The stage is set for the larger, experienced stags. [deer roaring] They have only one thing\\non their minds, procreation. Slowly, the autumn sun gains in strength and disperses the swathes of mist. [deer roars] Full of hormone fueled energy, the senior stags are always on the move. [deer roars] They\\'re kept busy\\nbringing their does together and holding off rivals. [deer roars] The mating season takes a lot of strength, with the stags losing up to\\na quarter of their weight. And the does will only mate\\nwith the most successful stags. A stag of a completely different kind,\\nan elk. It uses the autumn\\nto put on reserves of fat before food becomes scarce again. [engine rumbles, horn honks] The starting signal. The humans, too, are now busy organizing reserves of food\\nfor the winter. A whole troop of rustic characters\\nset off. Their goal is a fish farm. The day before, they drained the water and now it\\'s harvest time. They encircle the fish with nets, then steadily reduce the circle. The atmosphere is tense. How will the catch be? A good year. Everyone gets stuck in and there\\'s plenty to go around. Fish farming is a centuries old tradition\\nin Poland. The men are old hands. The most popular fish harvested is carp, 20,000 tons a year. According to custom,\\nmost end up at home in the bathtub before being served\\nas traditional Christmas dinner. The first frosty night\\ngives the landscape a new look. Elks don\\'t mind the cold, not even -50°C bothers them. In the middle of the 20th century, elks here was almost extinct. Today, there are once more\\nseveral thousand of these impressive beasts\\nin Polish forests. And even if the icy temperatures\\naren\\'t a problem, the lack of greenery in the winter forces them to eat bark and brushwood. Back in the Tatra, the woods have been snowed in for weeks. [loud banging] With more than a quarter of the country\\ncovered in forest, wood is an important raw material. When the woods are too dense\\nfor machinery, logging horses are used. A traditional and, at the same time, progressive way of working. [man speaks Polish] As it avoids damage\\nto both ground and trees. [man shouting] The tone may sound rough, but man and animal are a practiced team and trust each other implicitly. [man shouting in Polish] The horses rely on the calls\\nof the woodsman and he relies on them. [man shouting in Polish] The work is potentially very dangerous, so only especially trained, experienced horses are used. Ancient forests and snowy mountainsides. The Tatra, with its prominent peaks and craggy ridges, is only one facet of Poland, the country with one of the richest varieties of wildlife in Europe.',\n",

       " 'The war in Ukraine is a moment of transition. The\\xa0\\nsecurity architecture in the region, and the world\\xa0\\xa0 as a whole, is changing rapidly, and various\\xa0\\ninternational actors are trying to turn this\\xa0\\xa0 to their own advantage, including Poland. Warsaw\\xa0\\nis carrying out an unprecedented military build-up\\xa0\\xa0 programme worth over $130 billion. The target\\xa0\\ncost of which could be as much as three times that\\xa0\\xa0 amount. There is no doubt that a large part of\\xa0\\nthis move is being driven by Russian imperialism,\\xa0\\xa0 but the project also has a double bottom. A large\\xa0\\narmy and close cooperation with the Republic of\\xa0\\xa0 Korea could be Warsaw\\'s wider plan to form a\\xa0\\nnew bloc of states in the centre of Europe,\\xa0\\xa0 trying to escape its semi-peripheral\\xa0\\nstatus vis-à-vis the West.\\xa0\\xa0 How does Poland want to do this?\\xa0\\nWelcome to the Twenties Report. What’s all the fuss about? Let’s start with the numbers.\\xa0\\nWhat’s all the fuss about? The government in Warsaw is in the process of\\xa0\\nimplementing more than 20 significant procurement\\xa0\\xa0 programmes for the Polish Armed Forces. Most of\\xa0\\nthem originate from the \\'Technical Modernisation\\xa0\\xa0 Plan\\', a document defining the modernisation of\\xa0\\nthe Polish army between the year 2017 and 2026.\\xa0\\xa0 Nevertheless, in fact, the vast majority\\xa0\\nof the orders have been announced in the\\xa0\\xa0 last few months only. These programmes\\xa0\\nare at various stages of advancement,\\xa0\\xa0 but the Polish Ministry of Defence\\xa0\\ndeclares its intention to acquire them all. The list covers the entire spectrum of\\xa0\\nstate-of-the-art systems needed on the modern\\xa0\\xa0 battlefield. Starting with aircraft, the list\\xa0\\nincludes the world\\'s best multi-role aircraft,\\xa0\\xa0 the American-made F-35 or the Korean FA-50,\\xa0\\ndesigned to replace the Soviet MiG-29s.\\xa0\\xa0 These will supported by the\\xa0\\nF-16s already present in Poland. The helicopter base would be\\xa0\\nreinforced with almost a hundred\\xa0\\xa0 American Apache AH-64s and more than\\xa0\\n50 aircraft from the British-Italian\\xa0\\xa0 conglomerate Agusta-Westland. Plus drones\\xa0\\n- Bayraktar, Reaper, Gladius or Warmate. Watching developments in Ukraine, Warsaw also\\xa0\\nwants to have the best artillery forces in\\xa0\\xa0 Europe. This would certainly be the case\\xa0\\nafter acquiring nearly 500 launchers of\\xa0\\xa0 H142 HIMARS rocket artillery or nearly 300 K239\\xa0\\nChunmoo - Korean equivalents of HIMARS. Whereas\\xa0\\xa0 Nearly 400 Polish Krabs and Korean K9A1s would\\xa0\\nform the core of the self-propelled artillery. The fist of the ground forces, however, would be\\xa0\\ntanks. More than 350 US Abrams and eventually up\\xa0\\xa0 to 1,000 Korean K2 or the Polish variant of this\\xa0\\ntank K2PL, supported by more than 1,000 Borsuk\\xa0\\xa0 and Rosomak combat vehicles. In addition, the\\xa0\\nPoles already have more than 200 Leopard 2 tanks. The airspace is to be controlled by the Vistula,\\xa0\\nNarew and Pilica systems, based on American\\xa0\\xa0 Patriots, British CAMMs and Polish Piorun and\\xa0\\nGrom systems, respectively. Reconnaissance\\xa0\\xa0 is to be provided by French satellites,\\xa0\\nSwedish AWACs and Polish FlyEye drones.\\xa0\\xa0 This will be complemented by the Miecznik missile\\xa0\\nfrigates, built in consortium with the British. These are just the major\\xa0\\norders or planned aqusitions,\\xa0\\xa0 which already exceed USD 130\\xa0\\nbillion. But that is not all. This equipment must be used and maintained by\\xa0\\nan army of soldiers - up to twice the size of\\xa0\\xa0 the current one. Poland currently\\xa0\\ncan deploy about 150,000 soldiers,\\xa0\\xa0 including the territorial defence forces. By\\xa0\\n2035, this figure is expected to rise to 300,000. Now knowing the output, let\\xa0\\nus ask. Why? What is it for? The reasons are many. The first is history. Poland has paid a high price for its weakness\\xa0\\nover the past 300 years. Institutional weakness,\\xa0\\xa0 and consequently military weakness, led to a\\xa0\\nloss of self-determination for almost 200 years,\\xa0\\xa0 with a brief interlude of freedom in the interwar\\xa0\\nperiod. It led to whole generations living under\\xa0\\xa0 partitions of various kinds and in conditions\\xa0\\nof servitude to the interests of other nations.\\xa0\\xa0 It also led to the deaths of millions\\xa0\\nin the face of uprisings, deportations,\\xa0\\xa0 and wars fought in the hope of regaining\\xa0\\nfreedom and agency. During this period,\\xa0\\xa0 many nations between Berlin and Moscow\\xa0\\nand further east suffered a similar fate. This sometimes hopeless struggle came to a\\xa0\\nhappy end in 1989, when Poland became the\\xa0\\xa0 first country in the Soviet bloc to hold free\\xa0\\nelections and get back on its feet. Once again. Although the Poles themselves, and I, the\\xa0\\nauthor of this script, am one of them,\\xa0\\xa0 do not often realise it, yet the last\\xa0\\n30 years have certainly been the best\\xa0\\xa0 period for the nation in the last 400 years.\\xa0\\nPerhaps even in its entire history. Although\\xa0\\xa0 Poland has not been without its problems, the\\xa0\\ncountry has come out of its misery to achieve\\xa0\\xa0 economic growth second only to China\\'s\\xa0\\nduring this period. The Polish economy,\\xa0\\xa0 along with other Central and Eastern European\\xa0\\neconomies, is on its way to catching up with\\xa0\\xa0 Western Europe. Until recently, millions\\xa0\\nof Poles emigrated to the West to take up\\xa0\\xa0 the most menial jobs. Now it’s Poland that is\\xa0\\noften the destination of economic immigration. In a word, Poland had the time and capacity\\xa0\\nto build capital, the opportunity it had not\\xa0\\xa0 had for the last few hundred years. But\\xa0\\nthe threats remained. Other countries in\\xa0\\xa0 Central and Eastern Europe also have a similar\\xa0\\nsuccess story and also face similar threats. While the first of the two main causes of Polish\\xa0\\ntragedies in the last few centuries - German\\xa0\\xa0 imperialism - has been widely suppressed.\\xa0\\nThe second - Russian imperialism - has thus\\xa0\\xa0 undergone successive incarnations. We could\\xa0\\nsee the first movements of the transformed\\xa0\\xa0 Russian imperialist hydra already in\\xa0\\n2008, during the invasion of Georgia. In the years that followed, the Poles\\xa0\\nand the rest of the region warned loudly\\xa0\\xa0 against Moscow\\'s policies - which, as everyone\\xa0\\nalready mentioned, were ignored in the West.\\xa0\\xa0 However, concrete steps to improve Poland’s\\xa0\\nown military capabilities were neglected.\\xa0\\xa0 Polish leaders seemed to place all their hopes\\xa0\\nin NATO and American military omnipotence. While a high degree of confidence in the\\xa0\\ncapabilities of an alliance is fundamental\\xa0\\xa0 to the functioning of any collective, this was\\xa0\\nan irresponsible action - given the rapidly\\xa0\\xa0 destabilising security architecture in Europe\\xa0\\nunder the influence of the Kremlin\\'s actions.\\xa0\\xa0 Collective defence requires collective\\xa0\\ncommitment, especially from a country\\xa0\\xa0 in such a place in the world and with\\xa0\\nsuch historical experience. Meanwhile,\\xa0\\xa0 not even the Russian annexation of Crimea or\\xa0\\nthe fighting over the Donbas has mobilised\\xa0\\xa0 successive ruling camps to decisively and rapidly\\xa0\\nexpand the capabilities of the Polish military. Even if, in the event of a Russian invasion\\xa0\\nand the activation of NATO\\'s Article 5,\\xa0\\xa0 the Americans and the rest of the Alliance\\xa0\\nwere to act immediately to defend Poland,\\xa0\\xa0 the war would continue on Polish territory for\\xa0\\nthe first days, weeks and, according to some,\\xa0\\xa0 even months. Thousands of people would have\\xa0\\ndied, and the country would have been ruined.\\xa0\\xa0 Suffice it to say that on 24 February 2022,\\xa0\\nUkraine had a much stronger army than Poland,\\xa0\\xa0 and a potential Russian raid on Warsaw from\\xa0\\nthe Belarusian border could have ended much\\xa0\\xa0 worse than the Russian offensive\\xa0\\non Kyiv, which ultimately failed. It took Russia\\'s full-scale invasion of\\xa0\\nUkraine to shake up Polish policymakers\\xa0\\xa0 and lead to the launch of procurement\\xa0\\nprogrammes. Most of those mentioned\\xa0\\xa0 at the outset have already moved to\\xa0\\nimplementation after 24 February 2022. So, although there are many reasons for a\\xa0\\nmassive increase in the potential of the Polish\\xa0\\xa0 army - more on this in a moment - the fundamental\\xa0\\nreason is to avoid history repeating itself.\\xa0\\xa0 Many of its moments: the partitions\\xa0\\nat the end of the 18th century,\\xa0\\xa0 unsuccessful uprisings, or the carnage\\xa0\\nthat World War II brought to this region. While such arguments are difficult to\\xa0\\nrefute, and there is, in principle,\\xa0\\xa0 a social consensus on the need to strengthen the\\xa0\\nPolish Armed Forces, the policy and implementation\\xa0\\xa0 of the Polish Armed Forces Modernisation\\xa0\\nPlan have been met with criticism. Modernisation of the Polish military is well\\xa0\\noverdue. This is the main accusation. There have\\xa0\\xa0 been many signals over the past two decades\\xa0\\nthat the issue should be taken seriously,\\xa0\\xa0 but it took a full-scale war on Poland\\'s\\xa0\\neastern border to force Warsaw into action.\\xa0\\xa0 Poland wants to increase its capabilities\\xa0\\nin the short term dramatically. This puts\\xa0\\xa0 Warsaw in a weak negotiating position with\\xa0\\npotential contractors and drives up the price.\\xa0\\xa0 The price is also being driven up by the war in\\xa0\\nUkraine itself, which is creating demand for all\\xa0\\xa0 kinds of munitions and military technology,\\xa0\\nwhile global supply is severely limited. Poland, therefore, having, in principle, a good\\xa0\\nstrategic understanding, made no use of this fact\\xa0\\xa0 and did not start its own force modernisation\\xa0\\nearlier. The result is billions of dollars more\\xa0\\xa0 in costs and long times of delivery. And all\\xa0\\nthis with an aggressive Russia in the east. One consequence of the hectic pace is the lack\\xa0\\nof time for a multi-dimensional analysis of the\\xa0\\xa0 needs of the Polish armed forces - it is hard to\\xa0\\ntalk about such an analysis when programmes worth\\xa0\\xa0 billions of dollars are announced one after\\xa0\\nthe other within the space of a few months.\\xa0\\xa0 As a result, some purchase decisions,\\xa0\\nsuch as the decision to buy FA-50\\xa0\\xa0 aircraft or plans to buy nearly 100 very\\xa0\\nexpensive American Apache helicopters,\\xa0\\xa0 are often questioned by military analysts. Perhaps even more important case,\\xa0\\nis the degree of Polish industrial\\xa0\\xa0 presence and technology transfer in the overall\\xa0\\nmodernisation process. Some of the orders will\\xa0\\xa0 be manufactured in Poland to some extent,\\xa0\\nbut the fact of suddenly buying equipment,\\xa0\\xa0 often “off the shelf”, naturally has a\\xa0\\nnegative impact on the development of\\xa0\\xa0 the domestic defence industry and creates\\xa0\\nan outflow of capital from the country. Finally, can Poland afford such a massive\\xa0\\narmy? The spending of $130 billion - the\\xa0\\xa0 equivalent of Ukraine\\'s national GDP - is\\xa0\\nonly the procurement part. Analysts estimate\\xa0\\xa0 that procurement accounts for only 30% of future\\xa0\\nmaintenance and upkeep costs. Thus, the total cost\\xa0\\xa0 of current arms programmes over the next 30-40\\xa0\\nyears could reach up to half a trillion dollars.\\xa0\\xa0 And let us not forget that we are talking\\xa0\\nabout a medium-sized European country. That\\xa0\\xa0 is also why Warsaw\\'s announcement that it will\\xa0\\nincrease its defence spending to 4% or even 5%\\xa0\\xa0 of GDP - the highest level in NATO - is not just\\xa0\\na short-term measure but a commitment for decades. In addition to the financial issue, there are\\xa0\\nconcerns that modernisation will not be able\\xa0\\xa0 to cope with Poland\\'s demographics. With one of\\xa0\\nthe lowest birth rates in the world, increasing\\xa0\\xa0 the number of soldiers in the army from 150,000\\xa0\\nto 300,000 is troublesome, to say the least. That said - can Poland afford such an\\xa0\\neffort? The best answer - given Poland’s\\xa0\\xa0 history - would be that Poland cannot\\xa0\\nafford not to make that effort. But,\\xa0\\xa0 the implementation process itself\\xa0\\ncould have been much better. Now that we know the main reason why Poland is\\xa0\\nbuilding one of the strongest armies in Europe,\\xa0\\xa0 and leaving aside economic\\xa0\\nfundamentals and implementation,\\xa0\\xa0 let us look at the structure of foreign\\xa0\\npartners. Returning to the overview from\\xa0\\xa0 the beginning of the material,\\xa0\\nwe can quickly identify 3 trends. First, the dominance of the Anglo-Saxons,\\xa0\\xa0 especially the Americans.\\nSecond, the near complete lack\\xa0\\xa0 of European partners.\\nThird, South Korea. And they all interconnected. The Americans are traditionally seen\\xa0\\nin Poland as the most crucial allies,\\xa0\\xa0 which is historically rooted in similar interests\\xa0\\nin the Old Continent. The Americans have always\\xa0\\xa0 opposed the German-Russian rapprochement, which\\xa0\\nis the vital interest of Poland as well. Moreover,\\xa0\\xa0 among NATO members, Washington has by far\\xa0\\nthe greatest capacity and motivation to\\xa0\\xa0 come to Poland\\'s aid should Article 5 of\\xa0\\nthe North Atlantic Treaty be activated. Western Europe also has an industry ready to\\xa0\\nprovide Warsaw with the needed capabilities - the\\xa0\\xa0 French and Germans in particular. Nevertheless,\\xa0\\nthe years of pre-war rapprochement between Berlin\\xa0\\xa0 and Paris and Moscow deepened the Polish\\xa0\\nmistrust towards German and French capitals,\\xa0\\xa0 especially on such a sensitive issue\\xa0\\nas security. The policies of Berlin and\\xa0\\xa0 Paris at the beginning of the invasion\\xa0\\nof Ukraine only deepened this distrust. Warsaw feared a scenario in which, if\\xa0\\nit were Poland, which Russia attacked,\\xa0\\xa0 the supply of spare parts for German\\xa0\\ntanks or French helicopters, for example,\\xa0\\xa0 could be sanctioned by French and German interests\\xa0\\nrather than Polish ones. This could take the form,\\xa0\\xa0 for example, of imposing peace on the Poles\\xa0\\nagainst their will. Reports of such proposals to\\xa0\\xa0 the Ukrainians widely circulated in the media,\\xa0\\nespecially in the first months of the war. A third player - South Korea - fit the puzzle\\xa0\\nperfectly. I t was the alternative Warsaw needed. While the Americans may have common\\xa0\\nsecurity interests with Poland,\\xa0\\xa0 they are not necessarily interested\\xa0\\nin transferring key technologies to\\xa0\\xa0 Poland or in lowering the price when the\\xa0\\ncustomer is desperate to buy the product.\\xa0\\xa0 The Koreans, on the other hand, have seized\\xa0\\nthe moment to make an offer that is not only\\xa0\\xa0 often more economically feasible but also\\xa0\\nopens up new opportunities for Warsaw. The Koreans are not only offering to\\xa0\\ntransfer technology and the perspective\\xa0\\xa0 of Polish variants of the K2PL tank,\\xa0\\nfor example, but it looks they also\\xa0\\xa0 want to establish a permanent military\\xa0\\nindustry bridgehead in Europe with the\\xa0\\xa0 Poles which could eventually compete with\\xa0\\nthe German and French arms industries. Apart from Poland, there are many potential\\xa0\\ncustomers, in particular - Ukraine. But also,\\xa0\\xa0 for example, Romania, which shares\\xa0\\nmany interests, or the Baltic states.\\xa0\\xa0 South Korea is, therefore, both a bargaining chip\\xa0\\nfor Poland in its talks with the Americans and\\xa0\\xa0 an alternative to European partners,\\xa0\\nwhich could become its competitors. Thus, in the short to medium term, the Polish\\xa0\\narmy is to be able to defend the country against\\xa0\\xa0 Russia or, even better, deter Moscow from any\\xa0\\naggressive moves. The aim is also to replace\\xa0\\xa0 the loss of military equipment that Warsaw has\\xa0\\nhanded over in large quantities to Ukraine. Nevertheless, a powerful army could\\xa0\\nprovide Poland with the basis for\\xa0\\xa0 projects that go beyond the most basic\\xa0\\nobjective of defending its independence.\\xa0\\xa0 Some see this as a first step towards realising\\xa0\\nthe idea of an Intermarium - a bloc of Central\\xa0\\xa0 and Eastern European states with similar\\xa0\\ninterests, seeking to counterbalance the\\xa0\\xa0 economic dominance of Berlin and Paris\\xa0\\nand the military dominance of Moscow. The idea is not new. But so far, Warsaw\\xa0\\nhas little to offer potential partners,\\xa0\\xa0 even though they might have considered such\\xa0\\na route for the region. This may now change.\\xa0\\xa0 Poland’s military buildup will create\\xa0\\nan army that may even exceed its needs.\\xa0\\xa0 Therefore, Warsaw could offer to\\xa0\\nextend its own security architecture\\xa0\\xa0 to countries in the region that seek\\xa0\\ndeterrence against similar threats. The ultimate goal would be to create a bloc that\\xa0\\nwould speak with a common voice in Europe and the\\xa0\\xa0 world. There is no doubt that Poland\\'s most\\xa0\\nimportant partner in such a project would be\\xa0\\xa0 post-war Ukraine, which would also be a regional\\xa0\\nmilitary power in its own right. The Baltic states\\xa0\\xa0 also share a similar interest. Romania and\\xa0\\nMoldova, free of Russian influence, cannot\\xa0\\xa0 be ruled out either. Belarus would also be key in\\xa0\\nthe event of the fall of the Lukashenko regime. Belarus is another reason for the need to\\xa0\\nmodernise the Polish armed forces. The news about\\xa0\\xa0 the Wagner group is one thing, but if the regime\\xa0\\nin Minsk collapses, instability could spread to\\xa0\\xa0 Poland. A civil war could also break out, and\\xa0\\nWarsaw would want to support one side or the\\xa0\\xa0 other, most likely in alliance with Ukraine. To do\\xa0\\nthat, you surely need a big enough military stock. Warsaw is already quietly implementing the\\xa0\\nmeasures described above. The most important is,\\xa0\\xa0 of course, close cooperation\\xa0\\nwith Ukraine in the military,\\xa0\\xa0 economic and social spheres. But\\xa0\\nother initiatives are also underway. At the beginning of June, Polish\\xa0\\nPresident Andrzej Duda presented\\xa0\\xa0 his Lithuanian counterpart Gitanas Nauseda\\xa0\\nwith a proposal for the deployment of Polish\\xa0\\xa0 troops in Lithuania. The Lithuanian described\\xa0\\nthe proposal as \"very interesting\". A Polish\\xa0\\xa0 military contingent is already stationed in\\xa0\\nthe Latvian town of Adazi. Poland also wants\\xa0\\xa0 to support Moldova - a country constantly\\xa0\\npenetrated by Russian influence. Chisinau\\xa0\\xa0 recently received from Warsaw six planes\\xa0\\nwith weapons for the Moldovan police. Poland, therefore, wants to\\xa0\\nbecome an entity that is not\\xa0\\xa0 only a security recipient but also its donor. But while supra-regional cooperation on\\xa0\\nsecurity issues between Warsaw and the\\xa0\\xa0 regional capitals is conceivable, it cannot\\xa0\\nbe sustained long-term without an economic\\xa0\\xa0 setting based on technological\\xa0\\ndevelopment. And in this respect,\\xa0\\xa0 Germany’s dominance is unquestionable. Poland\\'s\\xa0\\nGDP is nominally six times smaller than Germany\\'s.\\xa0\\xa0 Given that the creation of a consolidated bloc of\\xa0\\nstates east of the Oder river is not in Berlin\\'s\\xa0\\xa0 interest, it can be assumed that the Germans\\xa0\\nwill suppress any attempts at consolidation.\\xa0\\xa0 And to counter this, Germany simply has\\xa0\\nmuch greater financial capacity than Warsaw. In this context, the issue of South Korea\\xa0\\nis relevant once again. When discussing the\\xa0\\xa0 prospect of Intermarium, the economic argument was\\xa0\\nusually the logical end of the discussion - the\\xa0\\xa0 project simply has no economic basis without the\\xa0\\nGermans. For a while, Warsaw hoped that perhaps\\xa0\\xa0 the Americans, without looking at the Germans,\\xa0\\nwould make a wave of investments in the region\\xa0\\xa0 that would ensure economic development. But this\\xa0\\nhas never happened on the required scale. Although\\xa0\\xa0 the US company Intel is opening a semiconductor\\xa0\\nassembly and testing plant in Poland worth almost\\xa0\\xa0 $5 billion, Intel\\'s more important and four\\xa0\\ntimes more expensive factory will most likely\\xa0\\xa0 be built near the German city of Magdeburg. The\\xa0\\nsame is true of Tesla\\'s choice of location for\\xa0\\xa0 its Gigafactory - Poland was considered, but the\\xa0\\nfinal choice was Berlin. With such investments,\\xa0\\xa0 Germany can always offer investors bigger\\xa0\\nsubsidies and concessions than Poland. Intel\\xa0\\xa0 in Magdeburg, for example, is expecting up\\xa0\\nto $10 billion in subsidies from the Germans. Meanwhile, Korea, as one of the world\\'s economic\\xa0\\npowerhouses, competes with German manufacturers in\\xa0\\xa0 many areas, such as the automotive and arms\\xa0\\nindustries. Seoul could therefore act as a\\xa0\\xa0 kind of technological accelerator for the new\\xa0\\nbloc, without having to look to the Americans.\\xa0\\xa0 Korea and Poland are not only cooperating on a\\xa0\\nmulti-billion dollar military contract. The Korean\\xa0\\xa0 conglomerate LG has Europe\\'s largest battery\\xa0\\nfactory near Wroclaw, while Poland\\'s energy\\xa0\\xa0 transformation is to include a nuclear power\\xa0\\nplant built in partnership with Korea\\'s KHNP.\\xa0\\xa0 Warsaw and Seoul are also discussing cooperation\\xa0\\nin the automotive sector, including electric cars.\\xa0\\xa0 The president of the Polish Investment and\\xa0\\nTrade Agency (PAIH), Paweł Kurtasz, said that\\xa0\\xa0 14 investment projects worth €3.9 billion were\\xa0\\ncurrently underway in cooperation with South\\xa0\\xa0 Korea. These would result in the employment\\xa0\\nof 5,500 people if they came to fruition. This naturally leads to points of contention\\xa0\\non the Berlin-Warsaw-Seoul triangle. These can\\xa0\\xa0 already be seen today, for example, looking on\\xa0\\nthe energy market. The Germans are pushing ahead\\xa0\\xa0 with their strategy of phasing out nuclear power,\\xa0\\nwhile at the same time criticising Polish plans\\xa0\\xa0 to build nuclear power stations with, among\\xa0\\nothers, Korean participation. We should also\\xa0\\xa0 mention a dispute between the American company\\xa0\\nWestinghouse and the Korean KHNP over using\\xa0\\xa0 Westinghouse’s nuclear technology. Both companies\\xa0\\nare to build nuclear power stations in Poland. In summary, the trilateral convergence\\xa0\\nof interests between Poland,\\xa0\\xa0 Korea and the Central-Eastern European\\xa0\\ncountries could be described as follows.\\xa0\\xa0 Poland reforms and modernises its armed forces,\\xa0\\nusing Korean technology, among others. Then\\xa0\\xa0 extends a medium-sized security umbrella over the\\xa0\\ncountries of the region, probably supported by the\\xa0\\xa0 battle-hardened Ukrainian army. Seoul provides\\xa0\\nthe region with technology and investment,\\xa0\\xa0 offering an alternative to Germany\\'s\\xa0\\nhitherto monopolistic position in the region. For Central European countries\\xa0\\nincluding Poland, the aim would be\\xa0\\xa0 to escape subcontractor status in the German\\xa0\\nsupply chain and break the glass ceiling of\\xa0\\xa0 being in an economically and technologically\\xa0\\nperipheral position compared to Western Europe. For Korea, the obvious impetus would be\\xa0\\nto enter the European market in a big\\xa0\\xa0 way and provide its industry with\\xa0\\na magnitude of orders for decades. All this is happening with the tacit encouragement\\xa0\\nof the Americans, for whom a solid wedge between\\xa0\\xa0 Germany and Russia is a desirable arrangement.\\xa0\\nSome would argue that the US even supports such\\xa0\\xa0 plans. Washington is establishing the permanent\\xa0\\nheadquarters of the Fith US Army\\'s Corps in\\xa0\\xa0 Poland - until now, Germany was the site of the\\xa0\\nmost easterly permanent American stationing.\\xa0\\xa0 The US is also the largest supplier of arms to\\xa0\\nPoland, and two of the three nuclear power plants\\xa0\\xa0 are to be built in cooperation with the\\xa0\\nAmerican company Westinghouse. In addition,\\xa0\\xa0 there is the aforementioned Intel plant and\\xa0\\nbillion-dollar investments by Microsoft or Google. The fact that the entire group of states in the\\xa0\\nregion share a common history and often common\\xa0\\xa0 oppressors is also inevitably important for the\\xa0\\nproject\\'s success. Which, again, converts into\\xa0\\xa0 a common worldview. The consolidation of this\\xa0\\narea is a somewhat structural and historical\\xa0\\xa0 phenomenon, as was proven by the centuries-old\\xa0\\nproject of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Still, a desire to bring the medieval colossus\\xa0\\nback to life in a new reality can be described\\xa0\\xa0 only as a utopia. The most likely scenario\\xa0\\nis an informal coalition of states speaking\\xa0\\xa0 with one voice on security issues and\\xa0\\nkey development branches. Coordination\\xa0\\xa0 of the bloc could occur through existing\\xa0\\nformats such as the \\'Three Seas Initiative\\',\\xa0\\xa0 the \\'Bucharest Nine\\' or the \\'Lublin Triangle\\'. On\\xa0\\nthe other hand, the \\'Visegrad Group\\' is unlikely\\xa0\\xa0 to be relevant and will lose importance as\\xa0\\nthe Budapest government is close to Moscow.\\xa0\\xa0 The same might be the case with Bratislava,\\xa0\\nwhich increasingly drifts towards Russia. Moreover, Ukraine\\'s admission into NATO structures\\xa0\\nwould potentially further strengthen the prospects\\xa0\\xa0 of such an initiative. The new bloc, whatever it\\xa0\\nmight be called, would not be in opposition to\\xa0\\xa0 the European Union. Given Brussels\\' strong support\\xa0\\nin the region, this is rather out of the question. The unprecedented modernisation of the Polish\\xa0\\narmed forces is, therefore, a multifaceted event.\\xa0\\xa0 At the most basic level, it is intended to help\\xa0\\ndefend the country against the real threat of\\xa0\\xa0 aggression from the Russian Federation.\\xa0\\nAlthough Moscow is bleeding in Ukraine,\\xa0\\xa0 in the event of a cessation of hostilities\\xa0\\nand a change in the international situation,\\xa0\\xa0 it has the opportunity to reconstitute\\xa0\\nits forces in the foreseeable future,\\xa0\\xa0 thus continuing to pose a\\xa0\\nthreat to Poland and the region. On the second level, Warsaw, in partnership with\\xa0\\nthe Koreans, wants to create an armaments base\\xa0\\xa0 in Europe that could compete with the French,\\xa0\\nGerman or Italian military centres. It would feed\\xa0\\xa0 off the growing demand for military equipment\\xa0\\nin Europe and the rest of the world caused by\\xa0\\xa0 the unstable international situation. However,\\xa0\\nits main customers would be Poland and Ukraine. Finally, the military power, arms industry and\\xa0\\ntechnological know-how provided by the Korean\\xa0\\xa0 cooperation would allow Poland and other countries\\xa0\\nof the region to form a bloc of states in Central\\xa0\\xa0 and Eastern Europe with similar intentions,\\xa0\\nchallenging the region\\'s semi-peripheral\\xa0\\xa0 position vis-à-vis Western Europe. Of course,\\xa0\\nthis is not about weakening ties with the West\\xa0\\xa0 or breaking the EU treaty but about changing\\xa0\\nthe relationship status from that of a junior\\xa0\\xa0 partner to the equal one. Of course, there are\\xa0\\na thousand reasons why this plan could fail,\\xa0\\xa0 but this seems to be the strategy\\xa0\\nthat Warsaw is currently pursuing.',\n",

       " 'It’s rare that a direction on a compass\\ncan carry such loaded connotations, and yet, in discussing the history of Europe, “East”\\nis a complicated word. In the past few centuries, “Eastern Europe”\\nearned an unfair reputation for backwardness, poverty, and unsophistication, for reasons\\nwe will see. It’s also rare for the simple act of reading\\nhistory to cause me physical and psychological pain. And yet… Poland … For reasons we will see. Our notions of Polish hardship tend to focus\\non the 1900s, what with the Soviets and the Nazis out and about — but Poland’s status\\nas the volleyball of Europe actually goes back quite a ways. Yet despite the best attempts of half a dozen\\ndifferent empires, Poland would not die, and that is worth investigating. So, to see how Poland’s story unfolds (and\\nfind out what Lithuania has to do with it), Let’s do some History! Being well outside of the Roman and Holy Roman\\nempires, we don’t get much on Poland until the medieval period, when Duke Mieszko I converted\\nto Catholicism in 966 and began expanding his Duchy out across the northern European\\nplain, reaching up to the Baltic Sea and down to the Carpathian Mountains. His son Boleslaw I negotiated with Holy Roman\\nEmperor Otto III to grant Poland an independent Church governance, adding 3 new bishoprics\\nto their original one, and a shiny archbishopric in the capital of Gniezno. To celebrate, Boleslaw promoted himself to\\nKing, but made the classic goof of splitting the kingdom between his sons. The hope was to keep government local and\\nresponsive, but the real result was several functionally-independent minor dukedoms who\\noccasionally threw hands at each other. His grandson brought the kingdom back together,\\nbut then it got divided again in 1138, and it stayed that way for 2 centuries. A consequence of this was a move away from\\na single rigid hierarchy to a more dynamic society of tenant-farmers, merchants, and\\nnobles spread out across market towns, church lands, and noble estates. Meanwhile, the Crown’s relative weakness\\nwas an opening for the Church to educate, govern, and shape Polish culture. It’s at this surprisingly early stage that\\nan idea approximating nationalism appears, as the church at the time was the only major\\nbody that transcended local politics, and some clergy vocally advocated for a reunified\\nstate under the polish crown. Hang on to that theme of indivisibility, it\\ncomes up later. Another big change came in the form of people,\\nas Germans from the HRE and persecuted Jews came to settle in Poland. In 1264 King Boleslaw V granted Jews personal\\nfreedoms and legal protections, which was a major rarity elsewhere in Christendom. And this welcome got a lot warmer during the\\nreign of Kazimierz III, who extended Jewish freedoms to the entire kingdom in 1334 and\\nencouraged more Jews to come to Poland. Kazimierz also gets points for codifying laws,\\nissuing a new standard currency, founding the first Polish university, unifying the\\npolitical machinery of the Kingdom (that’s a big one), and recouping some of the land\\nlost a century earlier to the Teutonic knights in the north and the Mongols in the east. The man was busy! And late Medieval Poland didn’t slow down. After Kazimierz, the crown passed through\\nhis sister to her husband Ludwik of Hungary. That wasn’t the best match, as he confiscated\\nsome Polish territory for Hungary and bribed the nobles with special privileges to let\\nhim do what he wanted, but after him, his daughter Jadwiga became queen of Poland, and\\nshe married Grand Duke Jogaila of Lithuania, which bound the Kingdom of Poland to the Duchy\\nof Lithuania in a personal union. Lithuania was very large, but also very pagan,\\nso as part of the marriage deal, Jogaila and his state converted to Christianity. Despite one of history’s largest overnight\\nconversions, the two states remained very different, and the Teutonic knights along\\nthe coast saw Lithuania as barbarous pagans, so they tried to invade, but lost at the battle\\nof Grunwald in 1410. In the century after the union, late-medieval\\nPoland saw its first local assemblies of nobles, and in the 1490s the Szlachta (as they’re\\nknown in polish) formed a statewide parliament, called the Sejm. By the 1500s, Renaissance arts and ideas made\\ntheir way north. And, when paired with good administration,\\nsome nice reforms, and hefty resource exports to western Europe, Poland was living it up\\nin a golden age. You know Copernicus? With the heliocentrism? Yeah, Poland. Now, the Personal Union between Poland and\\nLithuania was a familiar political arrangement, Europe made these things all the time, but\\nit was rare they lasted two whole centuries. In that span, Lithuania began to resemble\\nPoland in a few key ways, but it was still its own country, and opposed to a simple incorporation. So after some political wrangling, the Union\\nof Lublin in 1569, nice, established a bi-federal state with a jointly elected King/Grand-Duke\\nand a bicameral parliament of the noble Sejm [biannual] and a Senate [standing]. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, as it\\nwas to be known, had independent local laws, treasuries, and armies for each state — and\\nif this all sounds kind of insane, that’s because it is, which is the best part. At a time when the rest of Europe was big\\non centralized government and royal absolutism, the Commonwealth was a federal monarchy, which\\nwas elected by a parliament of nobles, who themselves accounted for 10% of the population. That’s nearly how many people could vote\\nin Democratic Athens. To make this outlier even more extreme, the\\nCommonwealth in the 1600s was one of the largest and most populous countries in Europe, with\\n11 million people spread over 400,000 sq mi. That included Poles, Lithuanians, Germans,\\nBelarusians and Ukrainians, Jews, and Tatars; and between Catholics, Protestants, Orthodox,\\n3/4 of the world’s Jews & even some Muslims, it was astoundingly diverse, in part because\\nit stood at the crossroads of several different cultures. But this regional centrality would become\\ndangerous in the next two centuries, as basically every empire in a 500-mile radius was keen\\nto grow larger at Poland’s expense. Various threats came and went, but sometimes\\ntwo would rear up at once, such as the later 1650s, when Sweden and Russia both invaded\\nLithuania in what’s known as The Deluge. Cities were ransacked and plundered, and the\\nwhole commonwealth briefly shrank to very small. The Commonwealth survived, but between war\\nand ensuing plague, it was gravely wounded: a quarter of the population dead, vulnerable\\nto outside threats, and falling into a governing crisis. See, the Republic had become a tragic victim\\nof its own lofty ideology. Wanting to avoid even the slightest whiff\\nof absolutism, the Sejm had a Liberum Veto which allowed any member of the Szlachta to\\nstop debate. In the best of times, this gave contrarians\\nan instant handbrake on the entire legislative process, but it was also laughably easy for\\nforeign powers to abuse. A single bribe could throw a critical reform\\nright out the window. So by the 1700s, the Sejm regularly failed\\nto reach any decisions. This was good news for the empires that encircled\\nPoland, as Russia, Prussia, and Austria all stood to gain from Poland’s newfound weakness,\\nand wanted to make it their puppet state. In 1764 Russia installed Stanislaw II as King,\\nand 4 years later a Confederation of nobles at Bar threw a rebellion against Russian influence\\nand interference, soooo Russia invaded and then Prussia and Austria just kind of also\\ninvaded while Poland was distracted. By 1772 a third of the Commonwealth was partitioned\\nbetween the three empires. From here, King Stanislaw was stuck between\\ndoing nothing and letting things get worse, or going rogue and actually trying to fix\\nPoland’s problems, which would provoke the empires, and make things get worse. To his credit, he went for it, calling a four-year\\nGreat Sejm in 1788 to write out a new constitution for the state, and a really good one too,\\nthey even dropped the Liberum Veto. But, of course, this was way out of line,\\nso Russia and Prussia and then later Austria invaded with the explicit goal of wiping Poland\\noff the map. By 1795 the three empires had partitioned\\nthe entire commonwealth, and Poland-Lithuania was fully gone. … Poof. SO… what does one do when an ancestral homeland\\ngets sliced up like a birthday cake? That’s a good question. Well, as the 1800s show, you write poetry,\\npaint, and throw a lot of revolts. Poland was right along many Europeans in channeling\\nRomantic Era ideals into a struggle for nationhood. But Poland’s situation was a little unique,\\nas they had a nation, and in the cultural sense they still did, but they didn’t have\\na state. In an interesting return to the 1200s, ideology\\nfocused on the church as a cultural anchor point for Polishness. And this meant that “Poland” as a concept\\nnarrowed significantly, away from the multiethnic and multifaith society of the commonwealth\\nand towards what we’d call ethnonationalism. Yikes. Really running with that Catholicism angle,\\nPolish thinkers conceived of their country as The Christ of Nations, which died in the\\npartition as a martyr for other nations and would one day re-emerge. I mean, in hindsight, not strictly wrong! Polish life under partition differed between\\nthe three empires. After some short-lived Napoleonic shenanigans,\\nthe “Congress Kingdom of Poland” existed as a vassal state under the supervision and\\ndirect governance of the Russian Empire. Later in the century it was stripped of what\\nautonomy it had and got absorbed fully into Russia. The situation was a little better in Austria,\\nas the Polish-majority province of Galicia was quite poor, but decently autonomous, and\\nGalicia became a center of polish consciousness as the century progressed. By contrast, Prussia, later Germany, had no\\ntaste whatsoever for Polish culture, and pushed for Germanization across the whole empire\\nbut onto Poland especially. Germany’s slice of Poland gained from the\\nindustrial revolution, but it was a pretty patchy process overall. And across the board, post-hoc justifications\\nfor partition relied on harsh stereotypes that have endured to this day. No no no, guys, you don’t get it, it’s\\nnot that we’re greedy, it’s that they’re bad, and don’t deserve to exist! Colonization attitudes, in my Europe? It’s more likely than you think. Despite several attempts at uprising made\\nover the century, none succeeded, and over 3 million Poles emigrated for the United States. It seemed as though the only hope for a revived\\nPoland was the complete collapse of the great European empires — but as it happened, that\\nwould not take long. And as we step into the first World War, I’ve\\ngot to work very hard to not fall into the infinite web of tangents and books-worth of\\nfootnotes for 1900s history. So WWI in the East was not a game of trench\\nwarfare, but armies constantly on the move causing widespread destruction. The collapse of all three partitioning empires\\nand sympathy among the allied powers cleared the room for a new Polish state to rise out\\nof the war, but there was constant friction with the other new postwar states, such as\\nLithuania. Meanwhile, Germany and Soviet Russia hated\\nall of this, so Poland’s task of reunifying and running their state also faced external\\npressure of German posturing and full-on Soviet invasion. In September of 1939 the Nazis invaded Poland\\nand the Soviet Union followed two weeks later, partitioning Poland just like the olden days. Russians persecuted class and political enemies,\\nGermans persecuted race enemies. And so the Holocaust happened. Death-camps like Auschwitz contributed to\\nthe systematic death of 5 million Poles, 3 million of whom were Jewish. They also killed Polish politicians, priests,\\nand thinkers in a bid to exterminate polish culture. In the face of this utter barbarity, the Polish\\nresistance was among the strongest in Europe, staging two mass uprisings and organizing\\nmilitary operations across the continent. Poles played a key role in cracking the Enigma\\nmechanism, and were vital pilots in the Battle of Britain. This got marginally better but infinitely\\nmore uncomfortable when Russia joined the Allies, and after the war the soviets turned\\nPoland into a communist satellite state. Once again Poland was materially and demographically\\ndevastated by the conflict, and the heavy-handed policies of Stalinism weren’t the most helpful\\nin the rebuilding process. Over the decades various reforms were made\\nand undone and then made again and so on, and once again, the Church acted as a vehicle\\nfor Polish unity, this time in opposition to communism. The election of Cardinal Wojtyla of Krakow\\nas Pope John Paul II was an indescribably huge deal for Poland. After the Trade Union “Solidarity” started\\nin 1980 and gained a huge following among Polish workers, support from America and the\\nVatican helped it become the main political opposition against the communist government,\\nand the church facilitated the negotiations to allow Solidarity to participate in the\\nelections of 1989, which broke the Communist monopoly on power. Poland’s pathway out of Communism in the\\n‘90s and beyond brought another series of struggles, but it’s largely a space they’ve\\nbeen before. And that’s one of the most confounding aspects\\nof Polish history: there are so many plotlines that seem to echo across time, and there’s\\nalso so much that couldn’t have happened anywhere else. Who could wind up with a government system\\nas absolutely bonkers as the Commonwealth? It’s amazing. Polish history can read like a tragedy, ‘cause\\noften it is, but the Polish people have more than demonstrated that’s no reason for fatalism. Thank you so much for watching! I’d like to apologize for the quality of\\nmy Polish pronunciation, because while I often like to try, it’s rare that I succeed. And of course, I’d like to thank our community\\non Patreon for supporting the work we do — some of their names can be seen scrolling along\\nright here. I’ll see you all in the next video.',\n",
       " 'By 1919, the First World War had left the old\\xa0\\nEuropean order in ruins and radically redrawn\\xa0\\xa0 the map. A new Polish republic struggled\\xa0\\nto establish itself, while the Bolsheviks\\xa0\\xa0 struggled to secure their revolution in Russia.\\xa0\\nIn the midst of the chaos, the two new states\\xa0\\xa0 launched into a full-scale war that will ravage\\xa0\\nEastern Europe again: it’s the Polish-Soviet War. In 1918 and 1919, both the 2nd Polish republic\\xa0\\nand Bolshevik Russia were fighting on many fronts.\\xa0\\xa0 The Poles fought the Germans, Czechoslovaks,\\xa0\\nLithuanians, and Western Ukrainians over disputed\\xa0\\xa0 borders, while the revolutionary Bolsheviks\\xa0\\nfought the counter-revolutionary Whites,\\xa0\\xa0 Allied intervention forces, and national\\xa0\\nindependence movements in the Baltics and\\xa0\\xa0 Ukraine. The border between Poland and Russia was\\xa0\\nstill up in the air in spite of the efforts of\\xa0\\xa0 the Allied peace delegations at the Paris Peace\\xa0\\nConference, who supported Poland but disagreed\\xa0\\xa0 on where its eastern border should be and how\\xa0\\nmuch military help they should provide. The\\xa0\\xa0 Allies proposed the Curzon Line as a border,\\xa0\\nbut this satisfied neither the Poles nor the\\xa0\\xa0 Bolsheviks – nor others who claimed parts of the\\xa0\\nregion, like Belarus, Lithuania, the White Russian\\xa0\\xa0 movement , and two Ukrainian National Republics.\\nIn Poland, Head of State Josef Pilsudski and his\\xa0\\xa0 socialist party favoured a federation under Polish\\xa0\\nleadership that would stretch from the Baltic to\\xa0\\xa0 the Black Sea , but Roman Dmowski’s National\\xa0\\nDemocrats wanted a more compact nation-state\\xa0\\xa0 with a Polish-speaking majority. In Moscow,\\xa0\\nBolshevik leaders also argued about their\\xa0\\xa0 goals. Some wanted to concentrate on defeating\\xa0\\nthe Whites and establishing a Soviet state in\\xa0\\xa0 most of the old Russian empire, while others\\xa0\\ninsisted on pushing the Red Army as far west\\xa0\\xa0 as it could go to bring the revolution to Europe.\\nMeanwhile, people living in Poland and Russia had\\xa0\\xa0 been suffering since 1914. Battles, harsh\\xa0\\noccupation by Austria-Hungary and Germany,\\xa0\\xa0 and the new wars after 1918 brought poverty,\\xa0\\nhunger, and disease that killed millions. The\\xa0\\xa0 coming war between Poland and Bolshevik\\xa0\\nRussia would only add to their misery. In early 1919, German troops left their\\xa0\\noccupation zone in the east, which allowed\\xa0\\xa0 Polish and Red Army units to advance into the gap.\\xa0\\nNeither side had a critical mass of troops for a\\xa0\\xa0 conventional campaign, so they instead engaged in\\xa0\\nskirmishes, guerilla fighting, and cavalry raids,\\xa0\\xa0 and used paramilitary forces as well. The Poles\\xa0\\ndrove the Bolsheviks from Minsk in August,\\xa0\\xa0 and took control of Eastern Galicia from the\\xa0\\nshort-lived Western Ukrainian Republic. At the\\xa0\\xa0 same time, the Red Army had its hands full until\\xa0\\nthe fall with White forces driving towards Moscow.\\xa0 Warsaw had gained new territories but they\\xa0\\nwere not easy to administer. The local\\xa0\\xa0 population was of mixed ethnicity, language, and\\xa0\\nreligion, and while many patriots welcomed the\\xa0\\xa0 Polish army as their own, others did not.\\xa0\\nEven amongst Polish-speaking Catholics,\\xa0\\xa0 local identity was sometimes more important than\\xa0\\nthat of the new Polish state. Some Polish troops\\xa0\\xa0 also acted harshly towards the locals, especially\\xa0\\nJews – although this was against official policy\\xa0\\xa0 and the army tightened up discipline soon\\xa0\\nafter. Polish-Lithuanian-German Michael\\xa0\\xa0 von Römer/Michal Roemer/Mykolas Roemeris wrote\\xa0\\nin his diary in March 1919: “The Polish troops’\\xa0\\xa0 advance onto Lithuanian-Belarusian soil […]\\xa0\\nis sad and pitiful in nature, and certainly\\xa0\\xa0 cannot contribute to glorifying Poland in the\\xa0\\nhearts and minds of the local people and is\\xa0\\xa0 not conducive to the idea of those lands uniting\\xa0\\nwith the Polish state voluntarily.” (Boehler 154)\\xa0 The Bolsheviks Russia also had trouble imposing\\xa0\\nits will on the peasants and non-Russians in the\\xa0\\xa0 borderlands. Many people resented and resisted the\\xa0\\nRed Army’s political terror, looting, or pogroms,\\xa0\\xa0 or opposed Russian domination. On the other\\xa0\\nhand some locals did support the Bolsheviks,\\xa0\\xa0 often because they feared the return\\xa0\\nof the Polish landowners. Overall,\\xa0\\xa0 locals were more worried about how any\\xa0\\narmed force in their area would behave,\\xa0\\xa0 more than which state or nation\\xa0\\nwas winning the war. (Boehler 152) In 1920, the Polish-Bolshevik border clashes\\xa0\\nescalated into a full-blown war. Polish-Russian\\xa0\\xa0 negotiations in March and April failed, partly\\xa0\\ndue to maximalist demands by the Polish side,\\xa0\\xa0 and partly because most leading Bolsheviks,\\xa0\\nlike Vladimir Lenin and War Commissar\\xa0\\xa0 Leon Trotsky, wanted to continue the war.\\nBoth sides prepared for renewed hostilities:\\xa0\\xa0 the Bolsheviks brought up reinforcements that\\xa0\\nwere freed up by victories against the Whites,\\xa0\\xa0 including the famous First Cavalry Army\\xa0\\nunder Semyon Budyonni, whose ranks included\\xa0\\xa0 future WW2 commanders Giorgy Zhukov and\\xa0\\nSemyon Timoshenko, and writer Isaac Babel.\\xa0\\xa0 To reach the western front they fought their way\\xa0\\npast yet another faction in the Russian Civil War:\\xa0\\xa0 the Ukrainian anarchist army under Nestor Makhno.\\nThe Poles felt they needed to strike before the\\xa0\\xa0 Red Army completed its pivot\\xa0\\nwest. Pilsudski was confident:\\xa0\\xa0 “I am not afraid of Russia’s power. If I wanted\\xa0\\nto, I could now advance as far as Moscow,\\xa0\\xa0 and nobody would be able to withstand my power.”\\xa0\\n(Borzecki 27). To help its cause, Poland entered\\xa0\\xa0 into an alliance with the Kyiv-based Ukrainian\\xa0\\nNational Republic under Symon Petlura. The\\xa0\\xa0 UNR had been defeated by the Reds and was\\xa0\\nsheltering in Galicia – and they hoped the\\xa0\\xa0 alliance with Poland would lead to a smaller but\\xa0\\nindependent Ukraine if Russia could be defeated.\\xa0 On April 25, 1920, 75,000 Polish troops and 12,000\\xa0\\nUkrainian soldiers launched the Kyiv Offensive.\\xa0\\xa0 Opposing them were probably about 30,000 men of\\xa0\\nthe Red Army, since Budyonni’s cavalry had not\\xa0\\xa0 yet arrived. The Polish 3rd army under General\\xa0\\nSmigly-Rydz struck the main blow towards Kyiv,\\xa0\\xa0 and at first they swept all before them in a war\\xa0\\nof movement. Polish cavalry dashed ahead, and\\xa0\\xa0 the outnumbered Bolsheviks retreated as quickly\\xa0\\nas they could with minimal resistance. The main\\xa0\\xa0 Polish force entered the city unopposed May 7, and\\xa0\\nthe entire operation cost the Poles just 150 dead\\xa0\\xa0 and 300 wounded (Davies 110), while the Red Army’s\\xa0\\nlosses were unknown but probably much heavier. So the Poles had won a great victory and\\xa0\\ncaptured Kyiv, but the Red Army was not\\xa0\\xa0 destroyed. Poland was not strong enough\\xa0\\nto launch a full-scale invasion of Russia,\\xa0\\xa0 and the Bolsheviks still had\\xa0\\nthe means to strike back. With Poles in control of Eastern\\xa0\\nGalicia and much of central Ukraine,\\xa0\\xa0 they had the chance for a strategic political\\xa0\\nvictory: an independent Ukraine that would fight\\xa0\\xa0 against Russia alongside them. Pilsudski\\xa0\\nmade a friendly declaration on April 26:\\xa0\\xa0 “I formally declare that the foreign invaders,\\xa0\\nagainst whom the Ukrainian people have risen\\xa0\\xa0 sword in hand to defend their homes from rape,\\xa0\\nbanditry and looting, will be removed by the\\xa0\\xa0 Polish force from territories inhabited by\\xa0\\nthe Ukrainian nation. The Polish forces will\\xa0\\xa0 remain in the Ukraine for such time as may\\xa0\\nbe necessary to enable a legitimate Ukrainian\\xa0\\xa0 government to take control.” (Davies 110)\\nThere is some debate about whether Pilsudski\\xa0\\xa0 really wanted a fully independent\\xa0\\nUkraine or a buffer state to gain\\xa0\\xa0 time in the fight against Russia, but in any\\xa0\\ncase Petlura failed to establish a working\\xa0\\xa0 administration or win over enough of the\\xa0\\nlong-suffering and distrustful population.\\xa0\\xa0 The last of many attempts at an independent\\xa0\\nUkraine after the First World War failed.\\xa0 Far from the battlefields, Poland was also\\xa0\\nwrestling with political problems. Opposition\\xa0\\xa0 leader Dmowski was not happy about the alliance\\xa0\\nwith Ukraine, some Polish communists went on\\xa0\\xa0 strike. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George\\xa0\\nwas especially critical: “The Poles are inclined\\xa0\\xa0 to be arrogant and they will have to take care\\xa0\\nthey don’t get their heads punched.” (Davies 112)\\xa0\\xa0 The League of Nations in Geneva even accused\\xa0\\nPoland of a premeditated attack on Russia.\\xa0 For the Bolsheviks, the Kyiv Offensive was a\\xa0\\npolitical gift. They claimed Russia was under\\xa0\\xa0 attack by the same Polish aristocratic landowning\\xa0\\nclass that was resented by many Ukrainian\\xa0\\xa0 peasants, some of whom joined the Bolsheviks.\\xa0\\nEven former Imperial Russian General Aleksei\\xa0\\xa0 Brusilov rallied to the Bolshevik side. g\\nOther Bolshevik thinkers like Mikhail\\xa0\\xa0 Kalinin saw the war as the chance\\xa0\\nto spread the revolution to Europe:\\xa0 “I believe the Polish lords by marching on\\xa0\\nthe Soviet republic are only digging their\\xa0\\xa0 own graves […] but they will only succeed\\xa0\\nin founding yet another Soviet state through\\xa0\\xa0 which we will gain close relations with the\\xa0\\nproletariat of the west.” g (Davies 114)\\xa0 Although Trotsky was worried about\\xa0\\nthe weak state of the Red Army,\\xa0\\xa0 the Bolsheviks launched an offensive in\\xa0\\nBelarus on May 15. Under the command of\\xa0\\xa0 27-year-old General Mikhail Tukhachevsky, himself\\xa0\\npartly of Polish origin, they drove the Poles\\xa0\\xa0 back over 100km and relieved the pressure\\xa0\\nin Ukraine, before Polish counterattacks\\xa0\\xa0 stabilized the northern front in June.\\nIn the south, Budyonni’s First Cavalry\\xa0\\xa0 finally arrived at the front on May 18, but the\\xa0\\nRed offensive in Ukraine got off to a bad start.\\xa0\\xa0 Budyonni lost two armored trains, and the Orenburg\\xa0\\nCossacks switched over to the Polish side. But\\xa0\\xa0 then the Red horsemen changed tactics to operate\\xa0\\nin smaller groups and concentrate on strongpoints,\\xa0\\xa0 which led to a breakthrough on June 5 – for\\xa0\\nwhich Joseph Stalin would later unjustly take\\xa0\\xa0 credit since he was the top Bolshevik on\\xa0\\nthat part o the font. The Poles managed\\xa0\\xa0 to avoid the complete destruction of their\\xa0\\narmy partly thanks to Budyonni’s hesitations,\\xa0\\xa0 and partly due to their advantage in the air.\\xa0\\nIsaak Babel wrote autobiographical stories\\xa0\\xa0 about his experiences, including an attack\\xa0\\nby a Polish-American volunteer squadron:\\xa0 “They dropped down to three hundred metres and\\xa0\\nshot up first Andrushka and then Trunov. None of\\xa0\\xa0 the shots fired by our men did the Americans any\\xa0\\nharm…So after half an hour, we were able to ride\\xa0\\xa0 out and fetch the corpses […] All [Trunov’s]\\xa0\\nwounds were in his face, his cheeks punctured\\xa0\\xa0 all over, his tongue ripped out.” (Davies 129)\\nThe Red Army took Kyiv on June 10, and reached\\xa0\\xa0 Pilsudski’s former headquarters\\xa0\\nat Rivne at the start of July. So the Poles had taken half of Ukraine,\\xa0\\nonly to be driven back again early in\\xa0\\xa0 the summer of 1920. With the Red Army\\xa0\\nmarching west, the spectre of European\\xa0\\xa0 revolution was on the horizon, unless the\\xa0\\ndesperate Poles could pull off a miracle. The Bolshevik command was now ready to launch\\xa0\\nan offensive across the entire length of the\\xa0\\xa0 front – and Tukhechevsky announced the revolution\\xa0\\nwould advance over the corpses of White Poland.\\xa0 In the south, the Red Army reached\\xa0\\nLviv after a hard-fought advance,\\xa0\\xa0 and laid siege to the town in early August.\\xa0\\nBabel recalled the aftermath and the corpses:\\xa0\\xa0 “A field of horror, strewn with mangled\\xa0\\ndead, inhuman cruelty, unimaginable wounds,\\xa0\\xa0 crushed skulls, young, white naked bodies\\xa0\\nflashing in the sun, lost notebooks laying about,\\xa0\\xa0 single pages, paybooks, prayer books, human\\xa0\\ncadavers in the grain.” (Lehnstaedt 89)\\xa0 But the main Red offensive came in the north, in\\xa0\\nJuly. The Bolsheviks outnumbered the Poles 160,000\\xa0\\xa0 to 115,000 in men, and had a crucial 3 to\\xa0\\n1 advantage in artillery. Red Army cavalry\\xa0\\xa0 under General Gaia Gai led the advance, who\\xa0\\nmanaged to defeat a Polish force equipped\\xa0\\xa0 with French tanks at Grodno on the 19th.\\nThe Poles intercepted Red Army telegrams,\\xa0\\xa0 and they even re-used old German trenches\\xa0\\nfrom the First World War – but they could\\xa0\\xa0 not stop the Bolsheviks. During the Red Army’s\\xa0\\nadvance, Lithuania joined in the fighting to\\xa0\\xa0 recover the disputed city of Vilnius from\\xa0\\nthe Poles, though the Reds insisted it\\xa0\\xa0 was theirs. By August 1, the Red Army was\\xa0\\njust 200km from Warsaw. A week after that,\\xa0\\xa0 Tukhachevsky’s spearheads were northwest of the\\xa0\\nPolish capital, threatening it with encirclement.\\xa0 The series of Polish defeats plunged the\\xa0\\ncountry into a crisis. Pilsudski was painfully\\xa0\\xa0 aware of the situation: “This breakdown of our\\xa0\\nforces, this sinking morale was, in my view,\\xa0\\xa0 [Tukhachevski’s] greatest triumph.” (Lehnstaedt\\xa0\\n89) and he later admitted: “I could not trust\\xa0\\xa0 the morale of the troops or the civilians, or\\xa0\\nthe leaders of either group.” (Lehnstaedt 115).\\xa0 Pilsudski twice offered his resignation\\xa0\\nas head of state, the Prime Minister did\\xa0\\xa0 resign and a new government formed. The crisis\\xa0\\nalso worsened already tense relations between\\xa0\\xa0 Catholics and Jews. Because many associated\\xa0\\nJews with Bolshevism, the War Ministry reduced\\xa0\\xa0 the army to 5% Jewish soldiers, and put the\\xa0\\nrest into labour battalions to dig trenches.\\xa0 The war also divided some urban Poles from\\xa0\\ntheir rural countrymen. Middle class, urban\\xa0\\xa0 and middle class Poles mostly supported the war\\xa0\\neffort and saw it as a struggle for their nation\\xa0\\xa0 and Christian civilization. 100,000 men, mostly\\xa0\\nstudents, scouts and craftsmen volunteered for the\\xa0\\xa0 army, and middle and upper class women volunteered\\xa0\\nin non-combat roles like nursing. Most workers’\\xa0\\xa0 unions also supported the cause. Polish aristocrat\\xa0\\nPrince Lubomirski reflected this view in a speech:\\xa0\\xa0 “The war which Poland is carrying on is not one\\xa0\\nof conquest, but exclusively one of defense. The\\xa0\\xa0 Bolsheviks invaded Poland at the moment of\\xa0\\nits liberation and we were forced to take up\\xa0\\xa0 arms in our defense. […] We have only wanted to\\xa0\\nprotect those regions peopled by Polish subjects,\\xa0\\xa0 to liberate them from the oppression of\\xa0\\nBolshevism, and to create around us friendly\\xa0\\xa0 nations who will stand with us against\\xa0\\nthe barbarism of the East.” (Reed 223)\\xa0 Polish peasants, on the other hand, were\\xa0\\nsometimes more hesitant, since they were\\xa0\\xa0 less likely to feel strongly connected to the\\xa0\\nidea of Polish nationhood. Patriotic volunteer\\xa0\\xa0 Michal Slowikowski recalled a peasant soldier\\xa0\\nscoffing at the notion of national honour:\\xa0\\xa0 “What does honor give me when the lice are\\xa0\\nbiting?! […] Do [our soldiers] all have boots\\xa0\\xa0 on their feet? And you know how many haven’t got\\xa0\\nshirts? […] Honor, my ass! If there’s nothing to\\xa0\\xa0 eat, the lice are biting, and the soldiers\\xa0\\nhave no underpants. […] Whoever wants war is\\xa0\\xa0 welcome to fight, but it’s a farmer’s job\\xa0\\nto cultivate the soil.” (Boehler 134-135)\\xa0 Poland was both united and divided in the face\\xa0\\nof defeat, and Warsaw called on its British and\\xa0\\xa0 French allies to help. The Allies sent weapons\\xa0\\nand a Military Commission to advise the Poles,\\xa0\\xa0 including French officer Charles De Gaulle, but\\xa0\\nneither country was willing to enter the war . On\\xa0\\xa0 the diplomatic front, the British and French tried\\xa0\\nto force both side to accept the Curzon Line and\\xa0\\xa0 get the Bolsheviks to accept Polish independence.\\nBehind the scenes, the Bolsheviks also faced\\xa0\\xa0 internal troubles. Commander in Chief Sergey\\xa0\\nKamenev wanted to stop at the Curzon Line,\\xa0\\xa0 whereas War Commissar Leon Trotsky thought\\xa0\\nthe army should be able to cross the line\\xa0\\xa0 temporarily if necessary. Lenin, however, gave\\xa0\\norders to push past the Line in mid-July. They\\xa0\\xa0 set up a Polish Revolutionary Committee\\xa0\\nunder Polish Bolshevik Feliks Dzerzhinsky,\\xa0\\xa0 head of the Cheka secret police. The Committee\\xa0\\nwas crystal clear about their plans for Poland:\\xa0\\xa0 “All representatives of the Polish bourgeoisie\\xa0\\nand landowners, all who support White Poland,\\xa0\\xa0 will be arrested and sent to\\xa0\\nconcentration camps.” (Engelstein 501)\\xa0 Red leaders also differed as to what to do\\xa0\\nonce they had defeated Poland. The Red Army\\xa0\\xa0 was too weak to conquer the rest of Europe,\\xa0\\nso Tukhachevsky favoured limited war aims,\\xa0\\xa0 like a deal with Weimar Germany over a future\\xa0\\nRussian-German border. Lenin hoped that once\\xa0\\xa0 the Red Army took Poland, its simple presence on\\xa0\\nthe border with Germany, Romania and Hungary might\\xa0\\xa0 set off an unstoppable wave of revolution\\xa0\\nthat would not require military conquest.\\xa0\\xa0 Some of the rank-and-file, like Isaac Babel,\\xa0\\nwere committed to revolution at all costs:\\xa0\\xa0 “We will wage war forever. Russia has thrown\\xa0\\ndown the gauntlet. We will march into Europe\\xa0\\xa0 to conquer the world. The Red Army has become\\xa0\\na factor in world politics.” (Lehnstaedt 93).\\xa0 Most Bolshevik leaders did at least\\xa0\\nagree that Poland’s presence in Belarus\\xa0\\xa0 and Ukraine was a strategic threat\\xa0\\nto Russia and both ideological and\\xa0\\xa0 military motivations caused Moscow\\xa0\\nto push past the Curzon Line. So the Red Army had the Poles on the\\xa0\\nrun and was at the gates of Warsaw. The\\xa0\\xa0 coming battle would decide whether\\xa0\\nthe Polish Republic would survive. As the Red Army moved into Poland, its military\\xa0\\ncommanders fought amongst themselves. Trotsky\\xa0\\xa0 and Tuchachevsky did not get along with the clique\\xa0\\nof Stalin, Yegorov and Budyonni. This stopped the\\xa0\\xa0 Bolsheviks from the making the logical military\\xa0\\ndecision to concentrate their forces in the north\\xa0\\xa0 under Tukhachevsky. To make matters worse for\\xa0\\nthe Reds, they expected the local population\\xa0\\xa0 would support them, but they faced hostility from\\xa0\\nthe majority of Catholics and Jews. This worsened\\xa0\\xa0 their already terrible supply situation, and\\xa0\\nthe army was short on food. Morale was low,\\xa0\\xa0 and desertions common – by August about 116,000\\xa0\\nBolshevik troops faced 156,000 Polish defenders.\\xa0 Still, Tukhachevsky launched his assault on\\xa0\\nWarsaw on August 13, 1920. He knew his forces\\xa0\\xa0 were overextended, but gambled that the poles\\xa0\\nwould not be able to react in time. On the 14th,\\xa0\\xa0 near Radzymin’s Red Army forces pushed back the\\xa0\\nPoles, but Polish General Haller’s defenders\\xa0\\xa0 rallied with the help of French-supplied\\xa0\\ntanks, and won a local victory that boosted\\xa0\\xa0 morale - some historians have argued that\\xa0\\nthis was the decisive turn in the battle.\\xa0 North of Warsaw, things went equally badly\\xa0\\nfor Gaia Gai’s Red cavalry. General Sikorski’s\\xa0\\xa0 inexperienced Polish troops pulled off a bold\\xa0\\ncounterattack, helped by the chance destruction\\xa0\\xa0 of a critical Russian radio, and prevented an\\xa0\\nencirclement . Some historians consider this\\xa0\\xa0 battle north of the city to have been the\\xa0\\ndecisive moment, not Radzymin. Regardless\\xa0\\xa0 of which was more important, both of these\\xa0\\nfronts held long enough for the main Polish\\xa0\\xa0 counterattack in the south to start.\\nThe Poles had planned a very risky\\xa0\\xa0 counteroffensive, which would lead either to a\\xa0\\nsmashing victory, or total defeat. They shifted\\xa0\\xa0 units to the southern flank, and then attacked\\xa0\\nnorth on August 16 to cut off the Bolshevik\\xa0\\xa0 armies threatening the capital. But if the Poles\\xa0\\nwere too slow, Budyonni’s cavalry might move west\\xa0\\xa0 from Lviv and catch the Poles in mid-maneuver.\\xa0\\nTukhachevsky had learned of the preparations,\\xa0\\xa0 but did not believe his intelligence reports.\\xa0\\nIf Budyonni had been quicker, he might have\\xa0\\xa0 caught the Poles in the flank and turned the\\xa0\\ntide of the battle – but he was too slow.\\xa0 The Polish attack smashed through weak Red\\xa0\\nArmy resistance and raced 120km into the gap.\\xa0\\xa0 Budyonni was too far away, and Tukhachevsky’s\\xa0\\nforces were stuck – they couldn’t take Warsaw,\\xa0\\xa0 and now the enemy was getting behind them. Three\\xa0\\nRed armies were routed within the space of a few\\xa0\\xa0 days, and a chaotic retreat eastwards began.\\xa0\\nSupply trains and artillery were abandoned,\\xa0\\xa0 and Gaia Gai’s cavalry was cut off and crossed\\xa0\\ninto East Prussia, where they were interned by\\xa0\\xa0 the Germans. As the remaining Red forces\\xa0\\nwithdrew, the Polish population that had\\xa0\\xa0 generally refused to support them now also rose\\xa0\\nup against them, as a Red Army commissar reported:\\xa0\\xa0 “[The locals] were extremely hostile to us…In\\xa0\\nmany cases the retreating units conducted\\xa0\\xa0 rearguard battles with the local population,\\xa0\\nduring which the Red Army soldiers dealt\\xa0\\xa0 brutally with the insurgents.” (Engelstein 507)\\nThe Polish victory at Warsaw was as complete as it\\xa0\\xa0 was surprising. Two thirds of Tukhachevsky’s army\\xa0\\nwas killed, wounded or captured – about 100,000\\xa0\\xa0 men . In Catholic Poland, many felt that divine\\xa0\\nintervention had granted them victory, and the\\xa0\\xa0 battle became known as the Miracle on the Vistula.\\xa0\\nLenin later reflected on what might have been:\\xa0\\xa0 “If Poland had become Soviet, the Versailles\\xa0\\ntreaty would have been shattered, and the entire\\xa0\\xa0 international system built up by the victors would\\xa0\\nhave been destroyed.” (Engelstein 507) Both Lenin\\xa0\\xa0 and Trotsky blamed Stalin for the failure since he\\xa0\\nhad helped keep Budyonni in Galicia for too long. Not only had Poland prevented a Bolshevik\\xa0\\nconquest and perhaps stopped the spread\\xa0\\xa0 of the revolution, but ironically the result of\\xa0\\nthe Battle of Warsaw may have had benefits for\\xa0\\xa0 the Bolsheviks as well. If they had won, the\\xa0\\nAllies might have intervened and potentially\\xa0\\xa0 overthrown them. In the words of historian\\xa0\\nLaura Engelstein: “Polish victory may have\\xa0\\xa0 saved Europe from Bolshevism; it also saved\\xa0\\nBolshevism from Europe.” (Engelstein 510) So by the third week of August 1920, the Poles had\\xa0\\nwon a major victory, the Red Army was on the run,\\xa0\\xa0 and armistice talks began at Minsk. But\\xa0\\nthe Polish-Soviet War was not yet over. In spite of this dramatic victory, Poland\\xa0\\nstill faced challenges. Pilsudski’s\\xa0\\xa0 Socialists and Dmowski’s National Democrats\\xa0\\nstill couldn’t agree on the eastern border,\\xa0\\xa0 and relations with Britain and France\\xa0\\nwere still difficult . More dangerously,\\xa0\\xa0 Poland was still at war with a larger\\xa0\\nand ultimately, more powerful neighbour.\\xa0 As the Polish army chased the defeated Bolsheviks\\xa0\\naway from the capital, the Red Army forces near\\xa0\\xa0 Lviv belatedly moved north to help their comrades.\\xa0\\nBut the Poles prepared a trap for the First Red\\xa0\\xa0 Cavalry Army outside Zamosc near the village of\\xa0\\nKomarow. Once the Red Cavalry had advanced close\\xa0\\xa0 enough to the city and engaged in fighting the\\xa0\\nPoles’ superior numbers of infantry and artillery,\\xa0\\xa0 the Poles sprung the trap and encircled the\\xa0\\nBolsheviks on August 31. The desperate Red\\xa0\\xa0 cavalry charged again and again to\\xa0\\nfree itself, taking heavy losses but\\xa0\\xa0 avoiding complete destruction. The Battle of\\xa0\\nKomarow, known as the Zamosc Ring in Russian,\\xa0\\xa0 is considered by many to have been the last great\\xa0\\ncavalry battle in history, and was the biggest\\xa0\\xa0 since the Napoleonic Wars a century before .\\nBy September 18, Polish forces had once again\\xa0\\xa0 reached Rivne. Exhausted Red forces were a sight\\xa0\\nfor sore eyes: “For every fighting man there\\xa0\\xa0 are 4 non-combatants, 2 ladies, 2 chests with\\xa0\\nbelongings, and even the combat soldier isn’t\\xa0\\xa0 fighting […] The Russian infantryman of the\\xa0\\nRed Army – barefoot, not only not modernized,\\xa0\\xa0 but really the face of poor Russia [...] bloated,\\xa0\\nlousy, runty, hungry peasants.” (Lehnstaedt 140)\\xa0\\xa0 These demoralized units also committed\\xa0\\nseveral pogroms against Jewish communities\\xa0\\xa0 as they withdrew, leading to responsible\\xa0\\nofficers being punished (Davies 232).\\xa0 Tukhachevsky planned to make a stand on\\xa0\\nthe Niemen River with fresh reinforcements,\\xa0\\xa0 but Polish commanders immediately launched an\\xa0\\nattack to destroy the Bolshevik Western Front.\\xa0\\xa0 In the third week of September, at the Battle of\\xa0\\nthe Nieman, Polish forces pinned the Bolsheviks\\xa0\\xa0 at Hrodno. After some early struggles, Polish\\xa0\\ncavalry crossed through Lithuanian territory,\\xa0\\xa0 pushed Lithuanian troops aside, and cut off a key\\xa0\\nrailway line. Other Polish forces captured Pinsk,\\xa0\\xa0 and the Red Army retreated to Minsk by October\\xa0\\n18. Pilsudski’s order of the day was triumphant:\\xa0\\xa0 “Soldiers! You have made Poland strong, confident,\\xa0\\nand free. You can be content with the fulfilment\\xa0\\xa0 of your duty. A country, which in two years\\xa0\\nhas produced soldiers such as you, can regard\\xa0\\xa0 its future with tranquility.” (Davies 238)\\nIn early October, the Poles signed a ceasefire\\xa0\\xa0 with the Lithuanians, but the Vilnius Question\\xa0\\nwas still unresolved in the eyes of Polish\\xa0\\xa0 nationalists. The day before the ceasefire was to\\xa0\\ncome into effect Polish General Lucjan Żeligowski\\xa0\\xa0 and his 1st Lithuanian–Belarusian Division\\xa0\\n- made up of men from the region serving the\\xa0\\xa0 Polish cause - crossed the border and marched on\\xa0\\nVilnius, easily capturing the city – a strange\\xa0\\xa0 end to the brief Polish-Lithuanian War. On the\\xa0\\n18th, Warsaw and Moscow agreed to a ceasefire,\\xa0\\xa0 bringing an end to the fighting.\\nAbout 200,000 Polish and more than 400,000\\xa0\\xa0 Bolshevik soldiers had been killed\\xa0\\nwounded or captured, and up to 450,000\\xa0\\xa0 civilians had died (Lehnstaedt 150-151).\\xa0\\nTens of thousands of prisoners of war held\\xa0\\xa0 by both sides also died from hunger and disease .\\nThe Peace of Riga signed in March 1921 shaped the\\xa0\\xa0 map of Eastern Europe for the next 20 years.\\xa0\\nThe new border ran east of the Curzon Line,\\xa0\\xa0 and left the fate of disputed East Galicia\\xa0\\nand Vilnius to Poland. Both formally became\\xa0\\xa0 parts of the Polish Republic within a few years.\\xa0\\nThe treaty also meant the end of Ukrainian and\\xa0\\xa0 Belarussian hopes for independence, as Poland\\xa0\\nand Russia recognized the Russian-controlled\\xa0\\xa0 Soviet Republics . Poland now included 1.5 million\\xa0\\nmore Poles, but also 6 million more Ukrainians,\\xa0\\xa0 Belarussians, and Jews (Leonhardt 1195), and 2\\xa0\\nmillion Poles remained on the Bolshevik side.\\xa0 Pilsudski considered the Peace of Riga a failure,\\xa0\\nas he admitted in 1925: “You will not be able to\\xa0\\xa0 keep this Poland. The storm that is coming is too\\xa0\\nstrong. Today’s Poland can only live in a special,\\xa0\\xa0 golden age […] I have wasted my life. I\\xa0\\nwasn’t able to create a federation that\\xa0\\xa0 the world would respect.” (Lehnstaedt 156)\\nBut in 1921, flush with a hard-won victory\\xa0\\xa0 in a war of national survival, few Poles could\\xa0\\nimagine the uncertain future that lay ahead. Not even 20 years later, Poland was\\xa0\\nravaged by war once again during the\\xa0\\xa0 Second World War and in 1944 Georgy Zhukov\\xa0\\nonce again moved through the country. This\\xa0\\xa0 time as Soviet Marshal and leading the 1st\\xa0\\nBelorussian Front towards the Oder River\\xa0\\xa0 with the ultimate goal of taking Berlin.\\xa0\\nThe battle for the capital of the Third\\xa0\\xa0 Reich was the dramatic climax on the Eastern\\xa0\\nFront and saw millions of soldiers clash. We\\xa0\\xa0 produced a 4.5h documentary series about\\xa0\\nthis important battle called 16 Days in\\xa0\\xa0 Berlin.

       " \">>> AIR RAID SIRENS AND  EXPLOSIONS WERE HEARD ACROSS  THE CRANING CAPITAL OF KYIV AS  RUSSIA LAUNCHED A WAVE OF  STRIKES ACROSS THE COUNTRY  OVERNIGHT.  AT LEAST 18 PEOPLE WERE WOUNDED  IN THE MASSIVE ATTACK.  TWO PEOPLE WERE KILLED BY  SHELLING IN THE SOUTHERN CITY  OF CROISSANT.  THEY SHOT DOWN 36 OF 43  MISSILES FIRED BY RUSSIA.  SO JOINING ME FROM KYIV IS THE  BBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT.  LET'S START WITH THE OVERNIGHT  ATTACKS.  THEY SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE  RATHER WIDESPREAD.  WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THEM? >> SADLY THEY ARE PAR FOR THE  COURSE.  EVERY OTHER NIGHT, YOU WILL  HAVE WIDESPREAD MISSILE OR  DRONE ATTACKS OR SHELLING CLOSE  TO THE FRONT LINE.  WE HEARD THE SIREN HERE.  WE WEREN'T SURE QUITE WHAT IT  MEANT, WE HEARD THAT THERE WERE  RUSSIAN BOMBERS TO THE EAST AND  THERE WERE TWO WAVES OF MISSILE  STRIKES FROM THE EAST AS WELL  AS THE NORTHEAST.  SO WE THEN HEARD THE SOUND OF  AIR DEFENSE SYSTEMS WHICH  CAUSED THE WINDOWS TO RATTLE  AND THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW THAT  YOU HAVE TO HAD TO THE SHELTER,  THIS TIME AROUND FOR THE FIRST  TIME REALLY SINCE RUSSIA TACTICS OF LAST WINTER, ENERGY  INFRASTRUCTURE HAS BEEN HIT. SO  I THINK THIS WILL BE A CASE OF  DCJC VU FOR MANY UKRAINIANS.  WE DON'T YET KNOW THE FULL  PICTURE OF CASUALTIES, BUT I  THINK WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT  HERE JUST BY THE SUSTAINED  NATURE OF THE RUSSIAN TACTICS  IS RUSSIA IS TRYING TO EXHAUST  UKRAINIAN AIR DEFENSE SYSTEMS  WHERE YOU HAVE A RELATIVELY  CHEAP URANIAN MADE DRONE BEING  TAKEN OUT BY A MUCH MORE  EXPENSIVE WESTERN SUPPLIES  MISSILE.  I THINK SECONDLY RUSSIA IS  CONTINUING TO TRY TO SUPPRESS  THE POPULATION BY FORCING  MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO TAKE  SHELTER AT UNPREDICTABLE TIMES.  SO SADLY I THINK THIS IS A  CONTINUATION OF WHAT LIFE IS  LIKE IN THE UKRAINE.  NECK THAT BRINGS ME TO WHAT HE  MAY BE ASKING FOR IN THE WEST,  BEFORE WE GET TO THAT, I WOULD  ASK YOU ABOUT A PIECE OF NEWS  THAT UNFOLDED OVERNIGHT,  POLAND'S PRIME MINISTER SAID  THAT HIS COUNTRY WILL NO LONGER  BE SUPPLYING WEAPONS TO UKRAINE  AMIDST A DIPLOMATIC DISPUTE  WITH GRAIN.  THE SEEM TO BE A RATHER BIG  DEAL BECAUSE POLAND IS SECOND  TO THE U.S. REALLY HAS PROBABLY  ONE OF THE MOST GENEROUS ALLIES  TO UKRAINE AND AT THE VERY LEAST , WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PEOPLE  FLEEING UKRAINE, MANY OF THEM  ENDED UP IN POLAND.  WHAT CAUSED THE FRACTURE?  >> IT IS ALL TO DO WITH GRAIN.  WHEN RUSSIA FIRST BLOCKADED  UKRAINIAN PORTS, IT'S ONE OF  THE BIGGEST PRODUCERS AND IT  HAD TO SHIFT SOMEHOW AND EXPORT  IT THROUGH OTHER MEANS.  AND OVERLAND IS ONE OF THEM.  AS A RESULT OF THAT, MANY  EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, YOU MEMBERS  FOUND MARKETS FLOODED WITH  GRAIN WHICH DROVE DOWN PRICES  AND ANGERED LOCAL FARMERS.  SO THERE WAS A BAND BY THE  EUROPEAN COMMISSION, THAT WAS  LIFTED, BUT THREE COUNTRIES  INCLUDING POLAND KEPT THE BAN  IN PLACE.  SO YOU HAD VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY  IN NEW YORK ACCUSING POLAND OF  HELPING RUSSIA AND NOW WE HAVE,  I THINK THE LANGUAGE IS BEEN  TOLD BACK A BIT.  GOOD POLAND ALLUDING TO THE  FACT THAT THEY WILL SEE WHAT  HAPPENS IN THE FUTURE WHEN  COMES TO SUPPLYING WEAPONS.  THERE'S BEEN A MORE  CONCILIATORY TONE IN UKRAINE  WHERE WE ARE TOLD THAT ANOTHER  DEAL HAS BEEN FLESHED OUT WITH  SLOVAKIA, ANOTHER COUNTRY  BANNING UKRAINIAN IMPORTS WHERE  THEY WILL USE A LICENSING  SYSTEM.  SO I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF  THIS ISN'T RESOLVED WITH  POLAND.  BECAUSE THESE ARE TWO BIG  ALLIES WITH DEEP HISTORICAL  TIES.  THERE'S ALSO ELECTIONS IN  POLAND NEXT MONTH.  I SUSPECT THERE'S POLITICS AND  PLAY AS WELL.  IT \",\n",

THEY ARE WILLING TO SEND IT TO US, THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE GONE TO GREAT LENGTH TO FIND THIS FOR UKRAINIANS AS YOU'VE BEEN REPORTING.

DO YOU THINK THIS RIFT COULD CAUSE POLAND DO YOU BACK OUT O HELPING UKRAINE, OR IS IT RARE AND SINGULAR DISPLAY OF DIVISION BETWEEN KEEP AND IT EUROPEAN ALLIES? >> IT'S MORE THE LATTER, AYMAN IT'S A RARE DISPLAY, AND THERE ARE, AS WE KNOW, POLITICS IN ALL THINGS THE POLLS HAVE AN ELECTION COMING UP, FARMERS ARE A IMPORTANT CONSTITUENCY, AS THE ARE EVERYWHERE THERE IS REALLY AN INTENT OF PART OF THE POLISH GOVERNMEN TO BE SEEN DEFENDING THE FARMERS.

       " 'On August 23, 1939, Hitler and Stalin entered into a secret pact. \\nIts goal was to destroy Poland. Nobody thought the war and its effects \\nwould last a half a century for Poland. First Germany attacks, \\nthen Soviet Russia. We don\\'t give up, despite being left on our own. We create an underground state, \\ncomplete with a government, an army, schools and courts. We suffer two occupations. The Germans murder millions of Polish civilians. The Soviets deport Poles \\nin cattle cars to gulags in the East; they shoot over 20,000 officers \\nduring the Katyn Massacre, and hundreds of thousands of Poles are forced into slave labor... \\nin the inhuman lands of the Soviet Union. Our army is reborn, moving West, where our soldiers \\nare already fighting alongside the Allies. We conquer Monte Cassino. Our fighters wreak havoc \\nand fear by air, too. The Germans call us \"Black Devils\", \\nas we crush their resistance. Paratroopers make their way to occupied Poland to support the underground state, \\nwhile our counterintelligence acquires secret plans of the enemy. There are Poles who save Jews, \\ndespite the threat of the death penalty. We create resistance movements \\neven within the German concentration camps. We are the first to alert the World about the Holocaust, \\nthough politics appear to be more important than human lives - and nobody listens to us. Polish Jews fight the Germans in the Warsaw ghetto, \\nwithout even a chance for success. Our nation comes up from the underground, and fights in the Warsaw Uprising. We break the German Enigma code, \\nsaving millions of lives... But in exchange for all that we do, \\nwe are betrayed - the Free World distances itself from us \\nleaving us behind the Iron Curtain.

Hey there kiddos; I need to talk to you about\\nsomething. It might be a little awkward, but it’s important\\nfor you to understand. When two countries love each other very much,\\nor sometimes, hate each other very much, one of the countries will invade the other one. And it’s perfectly natural, and it’s okay,\\nand it can be great, just so long as they plan for it, because the thing is, if you’re\\nnot careful sometimes invasions can happen by accident. Or at least, that’s what happened in May\\nof 2020, when Poland accidentally invaded the Czech Republic. This is Poland. It’s called that because it’s the land\\nof Po, the red Teletubby, who wanders through the country at night, kidnapping babies and\\nturning them into the sun, and this is… wait, what is this? I know it’s a republic, but which one? Let me check. Oh it’s the Czech Republic. Good thing I checked. Now, both the Czech Republic and Poland are\\npart of the Schengen Area, a set of 26 countries in which you can travel freely without border\\ncontrol or passports. Think of it like Disneyland—once you get\\ninto the park, you can go to any part of it you want: Fantasyland, Tomorrowland, Adventureland,\\nMonetizing-Nostalgia-land, Cash-Grab-Sequel-Land, Corporate-Consolidation-land, Ruining-Star-Wars-Land,\\nand Toontown! Who doesn’t love Toontown—it’s a town\\nfull of toons! The point is, anybody can cross from Poland\\nto the Czech Republic, or the other way around, anytime, anywhere, no questions asked. At least, that’s how things are normally—but\\nthings aren’t normally at all right now. I don’t know if you heard, but there’s\\nsome virus going around called something like Coronovinrus… wait no…coronavusus… no…Corbin\\nBlue-ness… uh …that’s not it… wear-a-mask-you-selfish-morons-virus? Yeah that last one sounds right. Anyway, because of that, countries have started\\nto act on a provision of the Schengen Borders Code that allows member states to temporarily\\nclose their borders, “in the event that a serious threat to public policy or internal\\nsecurity had been established.” Now I’m not sure how it’s going to help\\nto close their Borders; I mean Borders went bankrupt in 2011 and to my knowledge all the\\nstores are already closed—they probably should have shut the Barnes and Nobles—but\\nthe point is that they can. A border closing can be enacted by an individual\\nnation, and cannot be vetoed by the European Commission, though the Commission does have\\nthe ability to issue an opinion on it, which does nothing, but people always feel better\\nwhen they get to voice their opinion, even if it won’t change anything. Speaking of which, leave a comment down below\\nwith your opinion on an Israel-Palestine two-state solution! Since COVID hit, a lot of EU nations have\\nexercised their authority to close borders, including Poland and the Czech Republic. This meant Poland had to start doing something\\nthey haven’t historically been very good at: protect their borders from invasion. So, they stationed soldiers at the border,\\nincluding here, in Pielgrzymow, a Polish border town, but there’s where the problem came:\\nevery building in Pielgrzymow is in Poland, except for this church, which is in the Czech\\nRepublic… and also this house, for whatever reason. But the Polish soldiers were apparently too\\nbusy doing whatever Polish people do—pole dancing, polishing, pol-ates, who knows—to\\nrealize that, so soldiers had stationed themselves at the church thinking it was the furthest\\npoint of the border in Poland. When Czech people came to their church, in\\nthe Czech Republic, the Polish soldiers stopped them and they were like “hey you can’t\\ncome in here, this is Poland.” Then the Czech people were like “no it’s\\nnot.” And then the Polish people were like “yeah\\nit is, and also by the way, get out of here.” Which meant that the Polish military was blocking\\ncitizens of the Czech Republic from entering a part of the Czech Republic, and when that\\nhappens, it’s usually called an invasion, and it’s what political scientists refer\\nto as “kind of a big deal.” Eventually, word got back to the Czech Republic\\nthat they had been invaded, and so then they went to the Pols and were like, “hey uh….\\ndid you invade us” and the Polish people were like “I don’t think so, but let me\\ncheck.” And then they checked and the check showed\\nthey’d invaded the Czechs, basically putting them in a diplomatic checkmate. Ultimately, though, things turned out fine—the\\nPoles said it was an accident, the Czechs believed them, and after a bunch of fancy\\nofficial statements smoothing the whole thing out, things went back to as normal as things\\ncan be in 2020. Believe it or not, this wasn’t even the\\nfirst time a country has accidentally invaded another country. Back in 2010, a Nicaraguan official noticed\\na Costa Rican flag flying over here, across the San Juan River in the Isla Potillos, which\\nmade him very angry, not only because the Costa Rican flag has an insignia with writing\\nin the middle of it, which is a terrible flag design, but also because he was pretty sure\\nthat that land belonged to Nicaragua. Just to be certain, he opened up Google Maps\\nto check, and sure enough, the Costa Rican flag was in Nicaragua, and so he and 50 of\\nhis troops crossed the river, took down the flag, and stationed themselves there. Now normally when Google Maps is wrong, it\\nmeans I arrive late to my meeting of YouTubers who secretly fix the price of interesting\\nfactoids—no big deal, I’m just late—but for the Nicaraguans, Google Maps’ mistake\\nmeant they had just invaded Costa Rica by accident.

       " \"What’s up guys! My name is Ryan Shirley and I want to show\\nyou some of my favorite places in the enchanting country of Poland, so here is my Polish Top\\n10! Poland is home to some of the world’s most\\nstunning landscapes. From Gdansk’s medieval old town, to the\\ntowering Tatra mountains, Poland has so much to offer. Let's start this video off at the city of\\nKrakow. This may be one of my favorite cities in Poland. Located in the south of the country, Krakow\\nwas founded all the way back in the 7th century, so you best believe it's full of beautiful\\nhistory and architecture! One of the most impressive sights is the Wawel\\nRoyal Castle, it was built during the 14th century and was the first unesco world heritage\\nsite! It features architectural styles from the\\nmedieval, renaissance, and baroque periods! Such a beautiful building. From the castle, you can make the short walk\\nto the Main square. It dates back to the 13th century and it's\\nthe largest medieval town square in all of Europe which is pretty crazy! It's fascinating to think of all the history\\nthat took place here. In the corner of the square is Saint Mary’s\\nBasilica which was built back in the 14th century and is a perfect example of Polish\\nGothic Architecture. Another interesting feature of Krakow is the\\nKosciuszko Mound. It's an artificial hill that was modeled after\\nother prehistoric mounds in the city. It was built in 1823 to commemorate the national\\nhero named Tadeusz Kosciuszko. The mound is 112 feet high, and there's a\\nserpentine path that takes you to the top to enjoy panoramic views of Krakow and the\\nvistula river! What a beautiful city. After Krakow, we're going to head to the Tatra\\nmountains. Located about a two hours drive from Krakow,\\nthe Tatras are a stunning mountain range that straddles the polish and slovakian border. The best town to access the tatras is Zakopane. Located right at the base of the mountains,\\nZakopane is the starting place for your mountain adventures. During the winter time, Zakopane is an ideal\\nplace to go skiing, and in the summer months it's a prime place to start your hike into\\nthe mountains. One of the most impressive places in the tatras\\nis the Morskie Oko lake. To get there, you can take a bus from Zakopane\\nto the base of the Morskie Oko hike and then make the 16 kilometer round trip hike to the\\nscenic lake! What a phenomenal view! The Tatras are the smallest alpine mountain\\nrange in Europe and are home to plenty of wildlife such as the Eurasian brown bear. I just love how the tatras look, they just\\nhave such a unique jagged look to them! If you're into WW2 history, you can visit\\nthe Memorial of Auschwitz Concentration camps. Located about a hours drive from Krakow, Auschwitz\\nis infamously known to be one of the most horrific Nazi concentration camps. Over 1.1 million people died here. One of my favorite books I’ve ever read\\nis called “The Auschwitz escape” and it tells the story of how two prisoners made\\nthe daring escape from the concentration camp. After, we're going to head up to northern\\nPoland to visit Sopot. Located right on the Baltic Sea, Sopot was\\nestablished in the 8th century and grew as a commercial trade post & Fishing village. Over the centuries Sopot faced adversity as\\nit was abandoned, burned and rebuilt. But in the early 19th century, Sopot started\\nto gain popularity thanks to its spa and public baths and it quickly became a holiday resort\\ntown. Today Sopot is a thriving tourist attraction. While you're there you can take a walk on\\nEurope's longest wooden pier, or you can enjoy the swans and endless sandy coastline. Now I understand what it's nicknamed the Polish\\nriviera. After sopot, we're going to head over to neighboring\\nGdansk! Located just a 15 minutes drive from Sopot,\\nGdansk is one of Poland's oldest cities with a fascinating history with periods of polish,\\nprussian, and german rule. The earliest mention of Gdansk was in 997,\\nand during the middle ages, Gdansk grew as an important seaport and shipbuilding town! It rose to be the wealthiest and largest city\\nin Poland until Warsaw’s rapid growth in the 18th century. Sadly, a majority of Gdansk was destroyed\\nduring world war 2! Today Gdansk is one of Poland’s most beautiful\\ncities! I can’t believe how beautiful its Old Town\\nis, it's full of perfectly placed houses that seem to go on forever! I love how the canal runs right along the\\nold town, its full ships and gives the city such fun vibes. While you're there, you can explore the streets\\nof the old town or take a walk down the canal, what an incredible city! Just an hour's drive from Gdansk is the Malbork\\nCastle. Located in the town of Malbork on the river\\nnougat, this castle is the largest in the world by land area! It was built in the 13th century by the Teutonic\\nKnights, who were German Catholic Crusaders. As the number of knights grew, so did the\\ncastle, which encloses an area of 52 acres! It’s just crazy to think people were able\\nto build such buildings back then! Like Gdansk, more than half of Malbork castle\\nwas destroyed during WW2. Built thankfully it has been rebuilt to its\\nformer glory! After Malbork Castle, were going to head over\\nto the Masurian Lake District. Located in north eastern Poland, this lake\\ndistrict is the most visited in all of central Europe and is home to over 2000 lakes. There’s so many beautiful towns to explore\\nin the region and it's a prime place to go sailing and other water activities. I can’t think of a better place to go on\\na hot polish summer day. Aside from the lakes, the area is full of\\nbeautiful forests perfect for hiking and exploring. Mazury is definitely a hidden gem that deserves\\na visit! Another scenic place for nature lovers is\\nthe Pieniny National Park. Located in both southern Poland and northern\\nSlovakia, Pieniny is one of the smallest and oldest national parks in all of poland. I think this is such a beautiful area, the\\nriver runs right through it and acts as a border between Poland and slovakia. Its home to many animal species, such as the\\neurasian lynx. One of my favorite features of the mountains\\nis the Three Crowns. It's made up of 5 sharp limestone peaks that\\ncreate quite the sight. Another beautiful nearby spot is the Niedzica\\n(Nie deetza) Castle. This 14th century castle is located just a\\nfew minutes away from the park! What a beautiful area. After, we're going to head over to the beautiful\\ncity of Wroclaw. It's such a tricky pronunciation. Located in western Poland about a three hours\\ndrive from Krakow, Wroclaw is such a charming historical city! Its home to one of the most beautiful market\\nsquares in Europe, its lined with elegant townhouses and cobblestone streets. Wroclaw also has one of the most beautiful\\ncathedrals in Poland, it was originally built in 1272, but has been damaged and rebuilt\\nseveral times throughout the centuries. I love its double spires! It's impossible to beat Europe’s churches. For our final destination, we're going to\\nhead to Warsaw. Located on the Vistula River in East Central\\nPoland, Warsaw is the capital and largest city in the country. Warsaw began to grow in the 16th century when\\nthe capital was moved there from Krakow. It was called the Paris of the North, but\\nWarsaw was damaged extensively during world war 2 with over 85% of its buildings in ruins. Today its bustling capital with a population\\nof 1.8 million! One of my favorite buildings is the Palace\\nof culture and Science, at 778 feet tall it's 5th tallest building in the EU! The crowning feature of the city is Warsaw’s\\nOld town. It was established during the 13th century\\nand is full of history and medieval architecture. Like the main part of the city, the old town\\nwas almost completely destroyed during world war 2, but it was miraculously restored and\\nwas made a world heritage site in 1980. When you’re there you can explore the square\\nand marvel at all the history that took place in this medieval old town. Well that is it for my Poland Top 10! Let me know where your favorite place is in\\nPoland in the comments below! I also started a relaxation channel where\\nI post hour-long films with calming music to bring some peace and nature in your life. I'll be doing a film in Poland soon. You can find me on tiktok and instagram at\\nshirley.films. It's Ryan and we will see you later!\",\n",

       " \"SPEAKING TO CONGRESS, INSPIRING THE LEADERSHIP IN THE UK TO CONTINUE ITS SUPPORT NOW AS WE COME UP ON THE ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF RUSSIA'S INVASION. >> THE WAR HAS ENTERED A NEW STAGE IN RECENT WEEKS, AS DOZENS OF TANKS WERE PLEDGED BY EUROPEAN ALLIES TO AID IN UKRAINE'S DEFENSE. WITH SOME ALREADY ON THEIR WAY. LEADING THE CHARGE IN THAT EFFORT IS POLAND, WHICH IN LATE JANUARY STRESSED THAT EVEN IF OTHER COUNTRIES DID NOT WANT TO SEND TANKS, POLAND WOULD. JOINING US NOW, POLISH CHIEF OF DEFENSE, GENERAL RAY. POLAND HAS STEPPED UP IMMEDIATELY WITH NO DEBATE IN SO MANY WAYS. TELL US ABOUT YOUR VISIT HERE AND YOUR MESSAGE TO AMERICA AND OTHER PARTNERING NATIONS IN THE AID OF UKRAINE. >> A VERY GOOD MORNING. >> GOOD MORNING. >> UKRAINE IS ABSOLUTELY EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR POLAND. IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR THE REGION WITH GLOBAL IMPLICATIONS. FROM THE VERY FIRST DAY WE STARTED OUR SUPPORT, IN MANY DOMAINS, STARTING FROM A HUMAN APPROACH, OBSERVING 8 MILLION UKRAINIANS CROSSING THE BORDER. A FEW MILLION STILL STAYING IN POLAND. THEN WE STARTED SOCIAL PROGRAMS, MEDICAL PROGRAMS, EDUCATION FOR THEM. AND ADMITTEDLY, WE STARTED PREPARATION ON SENDING EQUIPMENT, AMMUNITION, AND ANYTHING THEY NEED FOR VICTORY. >> FOR VICTORY. >> GENERAL, SINCE THE WAR BEGAN, POLAND, THE CENTER OF GRAVITY OF NATO AND OF THE EU SEEMS TO HAVE MOVED EASY, TO POLAND, BASICALLY. POLAND IS AN INCREASINGLY, INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT COUNTRY. HOW IS THAT GOING DOWN IN POLAND? HOW ARE POLES REACTING TO THEIR NEW CENTRAL PLACE -- >> STATUS. >> -- IN EUROPE? >> WELL, YOU CAN FEEL EVERY SINGLE DAY THE CENTER OF GRAVITY ARE HISTORICAL COLD WARTIME DESIGN MOVE FROM GERMANY, TO POLAND, TO WARSAW. STRATEGY MATTERS AND GEOGRAPHY MATTERS. AND NOW WE HAVE ASPIRATIONS OF A WESTERN CIVILIZATION, AS WELL. SO NOTHING HAPPENED WITHOUT POLAND. WE INVEST HEAVILY IN SECURITY FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. 3% GDP, AND THE ENTIRE LIST OF PROGRAMS. MOST OF THE HIGH-TECH EQUIPMENT COMES FROM THE U.S., THE VERY FAMOUS, YOU KNOW, EFFECTIVENESS. M1 TANKS, AS WELL. THE MOST MODERN COMBAT PLATFORMS. AND VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS.\\nAND WE'RE GOING TO DO MORE. AND WE'RE GOING TO DO MORE. BUT THE FIRST IS JUST TO WIN UKRAINE. BECAUSE UKRAINE MATTERS. UKRAINE IS A BASIC PLATFORM FOR SECURITY. 100 YEARS AGO, THEY SAID, FREE UKRAINE, FREE POLAND. THERE'S A DIRECT CONNECTION, DIRECT RELATION. AND AFTER 100 YEARS, STILL. >> WE'RE ABOUT TWO WEEKS AWAY FROM THE ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF RUSSIA'S INVASION. OBVIOUSLY HAS NOT GONE THE WAY THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN THOUGHT IT WOULD GO. BUT FOR YOUR ASSESSMENT AS SOMEONE WHO STANDS SKPUNSAND UNDERSTANDS WAR, WHERE THINGS ARE GOING AND WHERE THINGS STAND GOING INTO THE SECOND YEAR. >> VERY DIFFICULT YEAR, BECAUSE MOSTLY IT GOES TO POLITICS, TO ECONOMY. SO WE NEED UKRAINE WINNING IN THE POLITICAL DEMAND, IN THE ECONOMICAL DOMAIN. THEY NEED MONEY, THEY NEED RESOURCES. THEY NEED EFFECTIVE SANCTIONS. AND OF COURSE, ONE OF THE CONDITIONS WILL BE THE MILITARY OPERATION, WHICH IS CRITICAL. BUT THE SITUATION IS STILL VERY DANGEROUS, VERY IMPORTANT, DRAMATIC FROM THE MORAL POINT OF VIEW. BUT IT'S DEFINITELY DECISIVE. WHAT WE DO TODAY GOES TO ETERNITY. IF WE NOT DO, IT GOES AS WELL. SO NOW OR NEVER. >> SO VLADIMIR PUTIN SEEMS WILLING TO ACCEPT MASSIVE, MASSIVE RUSSIAN CASUALTIES. THINK BACK TO THE SECOND WORLD WAR, PARTICULARLY. HOW LONG -- IS THIS INDEFINITE FOR HIM? IS HE WILLING TO STRETCH THIS OUT FOR YEARS? >> I GIVE YOU VERY MUCH A POLISH FLAVOR, A PERSPECTIVE. WE LIVE IN THE SPACE 1,000 YEARS AGO. SO WE KNOW THE RUSSIANS. THAT'S THE WAY THEY FIND. THIS IS NO SURPRISE FOR US. THE STANDARDS FOR RUSSIAN ARMY, FOR RUSSIAN SOCIETY IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. SO DO NOT COMPARE RUSSIANS USING WESTERN STANDARDS. WHAT YOU SEE BEHAVING, PERFORMANCE, YOU KNOW, HOW MUCH THEY'RE SUFFERING AND ARE STILL READY TO GO IS ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS IN SOCIETY. SO PLEASE DO NOT ASSESS RUSSIANS AND OUR STANDARDS, BECAUSE THEY ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT, FIRST OF ALL, I JUST WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT GENE SAID, IT'S REMARKABLE THAT POLAND NOW FINDS ITSELF WHERE WEST GERMANY WAS FROM 1945 TO 1989. YOU GUYS ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF FREEDOM. AND AS SUCH, I THOUGHT IT WAS FASCINATING, A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, YOU PUSHED THE GERMANS TO MOVE WITH THANKS. THE GERMANS THEN PUSHED THE AMERICANS SAYING, WE'LL DO IT, BUT YOU ALL HAVE TO DO IT, AS WELL. SO POLAND WAS A REAL LEADER THERE. I'M CURIOUS, WHAT DIFFERENCE DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO MAKE OVER THE NEXT YEAR, AND WHAT ELSE DO THE UKRAINES NEED THAT THEY DON'T HAVE RIGHT NOW? >> SIR, FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, OUR WILLINGNESS TO SEND EQUIPMENT WAS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. SO I GOT A VERY CLEAR MESSAGE FROM MY POLITICAL MASTERS, AS MUCH AS WE CAN, AND AS MUCH AS THEY NEED. SO THERE WAS THOUSANDS, HUNDREDS OF EQUIPMENT IS GOING TO UKRAINE. AND OF COURSE, FROM MANY OPERATIONAL REASONS, MILITARY REASONS, UKRAINE NEEDS TO CHANGE TO WESTERN PLATFORMS, BECAUSE OF AMMUNITION IS MUCH BETTER. SO POLAND FROM THE VERY BEGINNING STARTED TO PROMOTE IDEA TO BUILD A MULTI-NATIONAL COMPONENT AND WE ARE OFFERING A PLATFORM FOR TRAINING, FOR INTEGRATION, FOR NEW TANKS. SO THAT WAS THE REASON. AND BECAUSE WE ARE FRONT LINE, WE WOULD LIKE TO MOTIVATE AND INSPIRE ANYBODY, SO WE JUST OFFER A PLATFORM. BUT WAITING FOR ADDITIONAL, YOU KNOW, SUPPLIES. >> ONE OTHER QUICK QUESTION. WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT WEAPONS, WAS LET'S TALK ABOUT TRAINING. 2014 WAS A DISASTROUS MILITARY CAMPAIGN FOR THE UKRAINIANS. AFTER THAT, THEY STARTED TRAINING WITH NATO. THEY STARTED TRAINING WITH POLES. THEY STARTED TRAINING WITH AMERICANS. TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE OF HOW THE UKRAINIANS ARE NOW FIGHTING AND WE HAVE NCOs THAT GO OUT, CAN MAKE DECISIONS ON THE MOVE. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAVING A BOTTOM-UP APPROACH IN WARFARE AND THE RUSSIAN TOP-DOWN APPROACH. HOW BIG OF A DIFFERENCE HAS THAT TRAINING MADE OVER THE PAST YEAR. >> IT WAS AN ABSOLUTELY HUGE DIFFERENCE. AND ONE OF THE CRITICAL FACTORS THAT THE UKRAINE ARMY IS SO EFFECTIVE IS A CHANGE IN PHILOSOPHY OF LEADERSHIP. SO MISSION COMMAND, GIVEN AUTHORITY VERY MUCH NOW, WHICH IS VERY MUCH MORE WESTERN, THE RUSSIANS ARE GOING STILL IN A VERY VERTICAL DECISION-MAKING PROCESS, WAITING FOR PERMISSION. AND IT DOESN'T WORK. SO THAT KIND OF CHANGE AND INVESTIGATING NCO CORE AS WELL IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL. HUMAN FACTOR MATTERS. >> THE STORY OF POLAND REALLY BEING A CENTRAL PLAYER ON THE WORLD STAGE IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. AND POLAND REALLY STEPPED UP. >> HE WOULD BE SO PROUD. >> TAKING IN MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND STEPPING UP IN THE FIGHT WITH 100% RESOLVE. I WOULD SAY, I'M PROUD TO BE A POLISH AMERICAN, REALLY, REALLY INCREDIBLE STORY.\\nPOLISH CHIEF OF DEFENSE, GENERAL POLISH CHIEF OF DEFENSE, GENERAL RAY ANDRESCZEK, THANK YOU VERY\",\n",
       " \"[CC may contain inaccuracies] We're on the story.\\nThen the latest is Poland heading back into the EU mainstream?\\nAnd indeed, so what we've seen and it's a stunning upset for the ruling Justice\\nParty that was in power for eight years and frequently clashed with the EU and\\nalso more recently with Ukraine. So what we're seeing right now is that\\nthe so-called late fall, which is the projection based on 50% of votes\\ncounted, shows that the opposition parties, three opposition parties are\\nlikely to form a coalition together are in a comfortable lead.\\nThey're probably going to get 24 to 248 seats and 460 seats, the lower chamber\\nof parliament, which means they are going to take power after the election.\\nThe the unquestionable leader of the of the Opposition is done up to the civic\\nplatform. And he used to be a he used to be\\nEuropean Council president. So his first job and his first task will\\nbe to mend fences with the EU to make sure that Poland receives\\n30 billion or more than €35 billion in funds that was withheld by the EU.\\nSo that's his first order of business. But obviously this is going to be a very\\nslow process. The law and justice still got the most\\nvotes, and there probably are also going to get the first take at forming the\\ngovernment, which they're unlikely to to happen.\\nSo it will be weeks before we actually see the government being formed and the\\ncoalition taking power. The other good morning.\\nHow enthusiastically will markets take an opposition win if it is confirmed?\\nAnd is it just about getting those EU funds released or is there something\\nmore to it? So obviously the EU funds is the first\\nthing and it's kind of a more palpable thing, right?\\nWhat what's next is, is overall, it's also the change in the mood music.\\nWhat we've seen over the eight years is that Poland has been constantly\\nfighting. There was a constant spat over rule of\\nlaw, mainly with that with the EU. There was a lot of uncertainty.\\nSo what the opposition provides for the market is more certainty that this will\\nend, and that's probably the reason why we're\\nseeing the currency gaining. Just on the fact that this this means\\nPoland closer to the EU, but also Poland more confident it will actually tempt\\nstill top funds from the EU. And how important is it feel that we\\nknow that the Europeans know very well, Don.\\nAnd so given his given his role, he's not an unknown character.\\nIndeed. So that's obviously the fact that he is\\nsort of the leader of the of the opposition, although it's three parties,\\nas a matter of fact, that's obviously he's a known face in Brussels.\\nHe's been there, as you said, as the head of the European Council.\\nHe's been through a lot of crises. He was involved during the negotiations\\nover Brexit, over the Greek debt crisis. So he's a he's a known character.\\nAnd obviously he's been very much trying to stress during the campaign that what\\nhe needs to do is make sure that Poland is many ties with the EU.\\nSo obviously is the fact that he's ahead and is will probably be taken positively\\nby Brussels.\",\n",
       " \"When we consider the history of\\nWorld War II as a whole, the year 1943\\nis of paramount importance. The strategies\\nestablished by the Allies are starting to bear fruit. Little by little, Hitler\\nand the Axis powers lose their footing in Europe\\nand in the Pacific. The Germans and the Italians\\nwere threatened with a humiliating defeat on the coasts of North Africa,\\nbecause the Allied armies, under the command\\nof American General Eisenhower, constrained them\\nto abandon this continent. The theater of operations\\nfrom North Africa had already participated to mobilize significant\\nGerman military resources, far from the Eastern front, where the armies\\nof Hitler faced the Red Army. Furthermore, the Allies put\\nGerman territory under strain by systematically bombarding the\\nmain industrial cities of the country. At sea, the British in the Atlantic\\nand the Americans in the Pacific began to resist\\nvictoriously against enemy submarines. Planes and submarines\\nwere coming out at a high rate equipped production lines\\nof the latest technologies. The use of aircraft\\nmaritime patrol and light aircraft carriers\\nwas also increasing. The liberation of Europe\\nwas not possible before the battle\\nof the Atlantic is won. The genocide of the Jews\\nof Europe by the Nazis had passed\\nat a quasi-industrial stage. Accounts of these atrocities\\nreached London and Washington. The Prime Minister\\nBritish Winston Churchill, and American President Roosevelt judged that\\nthe only possible answer could only be total defeat\\nfrom Nazi Germany and its criminal ideology. Already focused\\non the next step, the march on Italy\\nwith Sicily as a starting point, the determination of the Allies\\nwas getting stronger day by day. At the end of 1942,\\nAmerican and British forces had successfully landed\\nin North Africa. The Allies had also reached\\nto retain many French officers previously loyal\\nto the Vichy government, who collaborated with the Nazis. In the spring of 1943, Germany and Italy had continued\\nto send reinforcements from Europe across the Mediterranean. Allied troops,\\ncomposed mainly of Americans\\nrelatively inexperienced, were moving forward\\nfrom Algeria to Tunisia and met\\nfierce resistance. They had to learn quickly,\\nin the worst conditions, but they were making progress. Towards the south, the Eighth Army led\\nby the English general Montgomery, had pushed the Germans back into Libya\\nand the desert fox, Erwin Rommel, exhausted by months of fighting,\\nhad been recalled by Hitler and replaced. In the South Pacific,\\nAmericans and Australians had undertaken operations\\nthat they hoped to transform in a series of victories\\nin the Solomon Islands, north of Australia. Painfully and\\nat the cost of many lives, they managed to resume\\nthe first Guadalcanal island. From this reconquest, they didn't leave\\nno respite for the Japanese. Japan, the strongest\\nHitler's Allies, controlled a large area\\nincluding part of China, much of Southeast Asia,\\nPapua New Guinea and in the North Pacific,\\ntwo small islands in the Aleutians. It was necessary to maintain\\nthe Japanese on the defensive to prevent them\\nto strengthen their positions on the islands\\nof the Pacific which they held, to build their air bases there and to make these territories\\nsafe areas. In Africa, these strategic problems\\nwere on the agenda. A conference was held in the city\\nMoroccan from Casablanca in January 1943. Churchill and Roosevelt, relying\\non the advice of their staff, accepted the idea\\nof an invasion of Sicily as soon as possible, pushing back the landing\\nin France the following year. This decision went against\\nof certain American generals who did not want\\nthat the war in the Mediterranean takes up too much\\nresources and time. The objective was to put Italy\\nout of combat, allowing the Allies to gain time\\nfor preparation for disembarkation in the north of France. The English knew they were fighting\\nan industrial and military power still practically intact. Hitler and the Powers\\nof the Axis should be weakened by a second front\\nin Italy in the first place, before the direct attack in France\\nmay be possible. At the beginning of April,\\nevents in North Africa and plans for the invasion of Sicily\\nhad become extremely important for all belligerents. Commander of the German forces\\nin the Mediterranean and North Africa, General Keyserling\\ncould congratulate his troops for having slowed down the progress\\nallied to western Tunisia. Time was not on our side\\nGermans and Italians. The Axis forces were slowly, but surely rejected\\ntowards the capital Tunis. Improved panzers\\nafter the clashes against Soviet heavy tanks, played an important role\\nin these fights. The British and the Americans\\nquickly strengthened their position, mobilizing a number\\ngrowing number of tanks and planes\\nin North Africa. Many airfields\\nbeing now under their control, they were able to bring\\ntheir troops effective air support. In the first week of April, the Allies bombed\\nnot only Italian soil, but managed to intercept transport planes\\nand loaded ships supplies for Africa. Moving carefully, sappers were working\\nfor mine detection and repairs\\ncraters on the road. The troops were happy\\nto cross these agricultural lands and its olive groves, after months\\npassed on rocky tracks of the Libyan desert. Even better,\\nTunisian roads allowed them a conduct\\nmuch softer and more comfortable. Planting these banderillas on Kesselring,\\nAmerican General Eisenhower was the commander in chief\\nallied forces in the Mediterranean, seconded by\\nMarshall Harold Alexander. Alexander reorganized\\nstrategically the allied front, placing American troops\\nwho were advancing from the west at the opposite\\nfrom the city of Bizerte, on the road that ran alongside\\nthe north coast towards Tunis. The First British Army\\narrival in North Africa with the Americans\\na few months earlier, was ordered to advance\\ntowards the Tunisian capital. One of the last commitments\\nfor the men of Montgomery took place in Wadi Akarit,\\n25 kilometers north of Gabès. The fight was fierce,\\nbut the British infantry, supported by\\na large artillery, was able to launch\\na general attack on the plain. On the evening of April 7, the Americans\\nand the English of the first army arrived in contact with the soldiers\\nof the Eighth Army which, for the most part, had never met\\nof American soldiers before. Allied troops\\nrecently arrived, discovered the soldiers\\nof the eighth armed and very seasoned, scruffy and undisciplined, but driven by a corporate spirit\\nand extraordinary combativeness. All units were grouped together\\nfor the final push Allies in North Africa. They had lost\\nthousands of men injured or killed in the desert sands. The progression continued. The Allies took\\nthe Tunisian city of Sfax which was quickly followed\\nby the capture of Sousse on the coast. Therefore, after having carried out\\nthe most decisive and the hardest fights\\nfor North Africa, the eighth army which had arrived\\nso far away, found herself affected in a secondary role,\\nthat of holding positions as far as possible\\nfrom Tunis to Bizerte and did not participate\\nin the last battles for Tunis. The die was cast for the Germans\\nand the Italians in North Africa. Among the Italians,\\nthe flaws in their alliance with Germany\\nwere more and more perceptible, aggravated by the imminence of a\\nAllied landing on their territory. Many Italian soldiers\\nwere prisoners and support for the Axis was less and less obvious\\nin the population. Enthusiasm for war\\nhadn't been very big in 1940. Libya, which Mussolini wanted to make\\nthe crown jewel of the new Italian empire,\\nwas now lost. The duchy therefore did not reap from these fights\\nonly paltry profits. The treatment\\nItalian workers sent to Germany\\nwasn't the best. Even their leader, Benito Mussolini,\\nasked questions on Hitler's intentions, because the supply promises\\ncoal and oil that Germany had promised\\nnever materialized. When Hitler and Mussolini\\nmet near Salzburg, in Austria,\\nboth appeared tense. Hitler's entourage was hit\\nto see to what extent Mussolini seemed discouraged\\nand sick, pleading for the beginning\\npeace talks with the Allies. The Führer did not want\\nhear about it and managed to bend it\\nand to comfort Mussolini so that he continues the fight\\nto hold Tunis, convincing his reluctant ally\\nthat it was essential so that fascism\\nsurvives in Italy. Hitler's own situation\\nwas far from brilliant. He had to face\\nto the criticism of his people who now\\nsuffered enemy attacks and who felt that the Third Reich\\nwasn't so invincible that we had promised him. Propaganda played a role\\nmore important than ever. Events in Russia\\nprovided Hitler with new arguments to justify its policy. In a village called Katyn,\\nin the Russian countryside near Smolensk, a Russian peasant made an astonishing\\ndeclaration to the German occupiers. The bodies of thousands\\nmissing Polish officers were buried\\nin the nearby forest. For Joseph Goebbels, the minister\\npropaganda, loyal to Hitler, this was the best news\\nreceived months ago. After some investigation\\nfrom the history of the Russian peasant, the Germans discovered a mass grave\\nof more than 4200 Polish officers massacred by\\nthe Soviets in 1939, when Stalin\\nwas Hitler's ally. The Russian position was delicate\\nbecause of their new alliance with the English and the Americans\\nafter Operation Barbarossa. The Allies considered Stalin\\nwith great suspicion. Goebbels was prompt\\nto condemn the unforgivable brutality Russians\\ntowards Polish officers, omitting of course to mention\\nof the barbaric treatment that the Germans they themselves subjected the Poles to,\\nespecially when they were Jewish. The situation became even more complicated. The Polish government,\\nin exile in London since 1939, wanted the atrocities of Katyn\\nlead to the end of the alliance with the Soviets. It took skillful political maneuvering\\nto maintain this delicate alliance. Responsible officials\\nAmerican and British succeeded in preventing what could have\\nbe a disastrous split in the allied pact. Furthermore, Poland remained\\nin the spotlight, because between April and May, the events\\nin the capital, Warsaw, occupied by the Germans,\\nwere going to make headlines. Eastern Europe in 1943\\nkept too many secrets and hid\\nfar too many horrors. At the beginning of April,\\na new gas chamber was opened\\nin the Auschwitz camp, one of the six extermination camps\\ninstalled on Polish territory. Thousands of deportees,\\nmainly Jews from the nations\\noccupied Europeans, as well as\\nPoles and Gypsies, were transported\\naboard cattle wagons. When they arrived, most of the men,\\nwomen and children were gassed. Only a minority were allowed\\nto live a little longer as forced laborers. In the Polish capital, Warsaw,\\nall the Jews had been confined in the old Jewish quarter,\\nnow kept and isolated from the rest of the city\\nby high walls. Around 400,000 Jews and a few gypsies\\nsurvived on minimal rations, because the Germans\\nused the deprivations to facilitate\\nthe spread of typhus and tuberculosis\\nincluding this weakened population. Then the pace of deportations towards the extermination camp\\nof Treblinka accelerated. In April 43, only 60,000 people\\nremained in the Warsaw ghetto, mainly young adults. These survivors, now knowing\\nthat he had nothing more to lose, had formed\\nresistance groups who had weapons\\ntransported clandestinely through the ghetto underground. After a first revolt\\nsmall in scale of the Jewish resistance in January, Heinrich Himmler,\\nhead of the SS, decided the time had come\\nto completely raze the ghetto. On April 19,\\nhe sent the SS there with tanks, flamethrowers\\nand demolition units. Despite desperate resistance\\ngroups that are however summarily armed, the Germans\\nreduced everything to ashes, 13,000 Polish Jews were massacred\\nduring this revolt. The ghetto uprising had been\\na courageous and desperate act of defiance. But he gave a taste\\nof what awaited Hitler and his generals\\nin a close future. Resistance against the Axis\\nwas getting stronger and stronger and the fighting intensified\\naround the world. For the Allies,\\nit was time to plan and strategic studies. Keeping shipping routes open\\nto transport troops to their destination was of vital importance. While the British Navy\\nregained control in the North Atlantic on the theater\\nSouth Pacific operations, American pilots\\nand the marines were at the forefront of the counterattack against Japan. In New Guinea\\nand in the Solomon Islands, in the north of Australia,\\nthe Japanese were now cornered on the defensive under the command\\nof Admiral I Roku Yamamoto. Yamamoto had done\\nhis studies in the United States. He initially opposed\\nto militarism who had driven\\nJapan at war, but now,\\nhe was a target for the Americans. He was the one who imagined\\nand planned the attack against Pearl Harbor\\nin December 41. The Japanese saw\\nin him a hero of the nation. The Americans were eager\\nto eliminate the person responsible thousands of deaths. In 1943, the Americans intercepted\\nand decoded a radio message who revealed to them that Admiral Yamamoto\\nwas going to come to the Solomons to inspect his troops. The bomber carrying\\nthe admiral had to land on an island near Bougainville,\\nin the Northern Solomons. On April 18, several American fighters\\ntook off from Guadalcanal following orders\\nof President Roosevelt and headed towards the route\\nwhich Yamamoto's plane was to follow. The bomber on board\\nwhere the admiral was, was attacked and went down in flames\\nabove the Bougainville jungle. Yamamoto's body was discovered by\\na Japanese research expedition, but Tokyo did not announce his death\\nonly weeks later lest it affect\\nthe morale of the population. The Americans, for their part, couldn't celebrate\\ntheir triumph publicly, because that would have revealed\\nthat he had broken the communication code\\nof the Japanese Navy. They also did not announce\\nYamamoto's death. On April 21, Roosevelt revealed that three airmen\\nAmericans had been executed in Japan. These three men,\\ntwo pilots and a machine gunner, were part of the 80 men\\nwho had survived the raid, led by lieutenant-colonel\\nJimmy Doolittle before. The Americans had hoped\\nstrike the spirit of the Japanese by bombing military targets\\nand industrial on their territory. It was the first raid against Japan,\\na humiliating provocation for which they would seek revenge. The news of this execution\\nprisoners of war horrified the Americans. Roosevelt announced that those responsible\\nwould not go unpunished. A message which was also\\na warning to the Japanese regarding treatment\\nof some 17,000 Americans then detained\\nby the Empire of the Rising Sun. In May 1943,\\na confrontation between the United States and Japan unfolded\\non the northern borders of the Pacific Ocean, in the Aleutian Islands. A chain of small volcanic islands, stretching from Alaska\\nto Siberia and Japan. In 1942, Japanese forces\\nhad seized of two islands\\nfrom the archipelago near Japan, Attu and Kiska. Thanks to their intelligence services,\\nthe Americans did not take into account this invasion, because they knew\\nthat it was just a diversion and what do the Japanese actually do?\\nwere going to attack Midway Island in the central Pacific,\\na more strategically important island. Japanese propaganda had largely\\nexploited this invasion of the Aleutians, and now the Americans\\nwanted to drive them out. They had started to build an airfield\\non Attack Island, near Alaska. At the end of April, an American expeditionary force\\nwas sent by sea from San Francisco to Attu Island, a desolate island\\nwhere the wind blew so strong that practically\\nno trees grew. After two days,\\nthe warships were in position and began to bomb\\nJapanese defenses. At the beginning of May,\\na dense fog drowned the island. Infantry, using barges\\ndisembarkation, surprised the Japanese garrison. During violent fighting which\\ntook place throughout the month of May, the American soldiers managed to reach the valley\\nleading towards Chicago Harbor. The Japanese did not surrender. The last of\\nthey left their position and charged the American lines\\nin a suicidal attack. She had no results. These fights were coming to an end and more\\n2,000 Japanese had already been killed. The Americans themselves,\\nhad lost 500 men and more than 2000 were evacuated,\\nvictims of cold or illness. Attu again\\nin American hands was now between\\nJapanese territory and the island of Kiska, where were still stationed\\nJapanese troops. This one wasn't going to stay\\non the island for a long time. The Americans barely came\\nto set foot on Attu in August 43, that the five men\\nof the Kiska garrison were evacuated, leaving the Aleutians and their climates\\ninhospitable to Americans. In North Africa,\\nGerman and Italian troops around Tunis\\nfound themselves trapped. They no longer had\\npossible path of retirement. Despite Rommel's request\\naddressed to Hitler and Mussolini to evacuate\\nthese men from North Africa and preparing them prevented\\nan Allied landing in Europe, the Germans continued\\nto transport troops and equipment to Tunis, and this, practically\\nuntil the last minute. In May, Bizerte fell to the hands\\nAmerican units and further south, General Alexander\\nlaunched a new offensive supported by important\\nartillery barrages against Tunis. Very quickly, the first\\nEnglish armored vehicles entered the city. Thousands of residents came out\\nin the streets to welcome them, throwing flowers to the soldiers. Outside the city,\\nenemy troops, although surrounded,\\ncontinued to fight, rejecting all\\noffers of surrender. Kesselring had already left\\nthe African continent, when finally,\\nat the end of the second week of May, the Germans accepted\\ntheir fate and surrendered. Prisoners of war\\ncrowded into the camps 125,000 Germans and 115,000 Italians. It was the biggest concentration\\nof prisoners at this stage of the war, with the consequence\\nserious logistical problems. Eisenhower was not particularly\\ndisturbed by this minor complication and jubilantly announcing to the world\\nthat the Axis armies were now retreating. Adolf Hitler had an army\\nwhich we called the Afrikakorps, commissioned by\\nGeneral Erwin Rommel, also known by the nickname\\nby Desert Fox. [German spoken audio] The troops\\ndu Renard were destroyed. All the men\\nof this army sent to Africa to fight under Rommel's orders\\nwere killed or captured. Three hours after the surrender,\\nWinston Churchill, in meeting\\nwith Roosevelt in Washington, received a message\\nof General Alexander informing him: “The campaign in Tunisia is over. All enemy resistance has ceased. We are the masters\\nof the coasts of North Africa. After three years of fighting, success and setbacks in the deserts\\nand in the mountains, the Allies finally rewarded, could celebrate the end of the control\\nof the Axis on this part of Africa. In Washington, President Roosevelt\\nand Winston Churchill discussed with the highest decision-makers\\nBritish and American military during a conference\\ncodenamed Trident. On May 19, Churchill addressed\\nin both houses of Congress, like he did\\nin December 1941, following\\nJapanese bombing against Pearl Harbor. He was welcomed\\nwith warm applause even before\\nbefore he delivers his speech. But Churchill was impatient\\nto get back to serious things. All the plans, he said,\\nmust be dominated by the supreme objective\\nto attack the enemy. Germany's defeat\\nmust occur first. It will inevitably lead to\\nthe defeat of Japan. There were disagreements\\nbetween Allied commanders on what to do\\nregarding future operations. Churchill demanded that a landing\\ntakes place directly in Italy, which, he thought,\\nwould serve to attract German soldiers far from the Russian front\\nwhere Stalin was still fighting for the survival of his country. Americans, on the other hand,\\nwanted to disembark on a large scale in France,\\nlaunched as soon as possible, and that no transaction likely\\nto delay this project from being undertaken. After a long debate, an agreement was reached\\nwithin the Allied command to disembark in France\\nin 1944 with a deadline scheduled for the month of May. Churchill obtained satisfaction\\nas for the Italian campaign, less priority, in order to force\\nthis country to cease hostilities. Furious fights\\ntook place in the Atlantic. Before a landing\\nin France can take place, the Allies knew\\nthat the Battle of the Atlantic had to be won. However, the heavy losses\\nsuffered in early spring had seriously affected\\nthe supply of the British Isles. There was great fear that the Germans\\nwon the war at sea. Fortunately, in May,\\nthe fate began to turn, slowly but surely. At the end of the month,\\na quarter of the entire operational force submarines\\nGermans had been sunk. The son of Admiral Donitz,\\nCommander-in-Chief of the Navy, perishes with\\nher crew on May 19. A few days later,\\nthe command decided that it was time\\nto withdraw from the South Atlantic. The handle of U-Boats\\nwho was still marauding no longer represented only a symbolic threat. The Axis Battle\\nfor two years to break the roads\\nsupply, was lost. Allied factories\\nincreased arms production, but the war effort was beginning\\nto be felt not only at sea, but also\\nin the skies of Germany. Throughout the spring of 1943,\\nwaves of British bombers attacked the main cities\\nof the Third Reich, following orders\\nof Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris. Haunted by the memory of the trenches\\nof the First World War, the British saw\\nin aerial bombardment a way to avoid a front on the ground\\nand accelerate the end of the conflict. Heavy bombing\\nwere not only aimed the most important industries. They were also used\\nas a psychological weapon to mine\\ncivilian morale. During the war,\\nhundreds of thousands of Germans found themselves homeless\\nfollowing these attacks. Living conditions\\ndeteriorated in the cities. At the same time,\\nsupport for Adolf Hitler, inevitably weakened. In May 1943, the R.A.F. finalized the last details\\nof a particularly daring raid to blow up\\nthe Ruhr dams in Germany. The objective was to break\\nthree dams in this region where were located\\nthe main production sites of German heavy industry:\\nsteel mills, chemical plants and coal mines. In the greatest secrecy,\\nan aeronautical engineer named Barns Wallis, developed\\na barrel-shaped bomb which he hoped would bounce back\\non the water surface towards the dam, thus avoiding anti-torpedo nets\\nwho protected him. The bomb was then to flow along\\nof the dam wall before exploding. On May 16, the air raid\\nsuccessfully destroyed the first two dams,\\nbut the third remained intact. Millions of liters of water\\ngushed from the breaches of the two dams flooding mines, coupons,\\nroads, railways, canals and water supply. At least 1,650 people drowned. Unfortunately, only\\nnine of the 19 aircraft of the R.A.F managed to return to their base\\nand 53 crew were killed in action\\nin this operation. Despite these losses,\\nthis event was a breath of fresh air for the morale of the British,\\nstill subject to Luftwaffe raids. As for the populations\\nof occupied Europe, the vision of these allied bombers\\non the way to Germany, gave them hope. A landing on the French coast\\nof the Channel was being prepared. This hope was therefore not\\nunfounded. To better prepare\\nthis operation scheduled in 1944, that is to say the following year, Roosevelt wanted to tie\\ncontacts with French resistance fighters. The French had been deeply divided by\\nthe Second World War. There were divisions\\nbetween those who supported General de Gaulle based in London\\nand those who supported the collaborationist government\\nof Marshal Pétain in Vichy. There was also\\ndeep divisions at the heart of the Resistance,\\nespecially due to the communists who did not support de Gaulle. During the conference\\nfrom Casablanca in January, there was a rather tense meeting\\nand difficult between de Gaulle and his rival, General Giraud, who continued\\nto maintain the Vichy regime in North Africa. However, jointly\\nat the head of the Free French Forces, they called all the French\\nto rally their cause. Later, the National Council\\nof the Resistance was established to organize\\nthe various resistance groups who carried out operations\\nof sabotage against the occupier. Part of the French population\\ndid what she could to help the Allies. During this time,\\nthe American secret services began to build their own relationship\\nwith the French resistance from contacts\\nestablished in Switzerland to improve financing\\nresistance actions and thus access\\nmilitary and strategic information on the troops\\nGermans in France. But fight for freedom\\nwas not done without risk. Shortly after the first meeting of the\\nnew National Council of Resistance, many chefs\\nnetworks were shut down. During the war,\\nmany men and women who fought\\noccupying troops in France were incarcerated,\\ntortured and killed by the Gestapo. But despite its dangers,\\nthe fight had never stopped. In Europe, the process of genocide\\nwas accelerating. By the summer of 1943, more than half of the Jews\\nof Europe had been massacred. Quite proud\\nof their extermination program, the Nazis never discussed the details\\nof these operations in their propaganda, using euphemisms such as actions\\nspecific or special measures. At Auschwitz, an average of 33,000 people\\nwere gassed every month. After elimination\\nfrom the Warsaw ghetto, on June 11, the leader of the SS, Heinrich\\nHimmler gave the order to dismantle and empty\\nall other remaining ghettos in some cities in Poland. Poland had\\nlargest Jewish population of all the states of Europe,\\napproximately 3 million people. Most of them will be killed, as well as three million\\nothers from elsewhere before the Allies\\ndo not achieve victory. Further east, in the Baltic countries\\nand in the part of the Soviet Union occupied by the Nazis,\\nspecial units of the SS, the Einsatzgruppen acted freely\\nbehind the front line troops. Entire communities were massacred\\nmercilessly during mass executions. While the Nazis pursued\\ntheir war of terror, the allies were getting closer. Following the agreements\\nof the Trident conference in Washington, preparations for disembarkation\\nin Italy were beginning. North Africa, now cleared\\nAxis troops, Eisenhower concentrated\\nhis attention to Mussolini in order to\\nto push him to stop the war. American bombers intensified\\ntheir attacks on ports, airfields\\nand industrial zones. In Sicily, the towns of Palermo,\\nCatania and Syracuse were targeted. Sardinia,\\nwhere there was a large garrison German soldiers,\\nwas also affected. Messina and Naples, Italy,\\nsuffered heavy bombardments. Allied aircraft based\\nin Malta had started to bomb\\nthe port of Naples since 1940. The city knew\\nwhat was an air attack, but with\\nthe acceleration of alerts, life in this summer of 1943\\nbecame unbearable. The explosions echoed\\nregularly in the city. Water shortages\\nand food were frequent. Despite significant reinforcements,\\nGerman air power in Italy marked time\\nfacing Allied aviation. The Neapolitans suffered one\\nof the largest bombings that they never have\\nknown until then. The Germans were\\nunable to send the planes and D.C.A batteries\\nthat Mussolini had urgently requested. Fearing that the Allies\\ndon't show up at any moment, thousands of Italians\\nleft their home in the south of the country. Convinced that it was\\nonly a matter of time before the allies do not launch the attack,\\nthe Germans moved troops from France to Italy. The Allies, however, had lost\\na little time to debate the best course\\nto follow for their campaign before deciding that Sicily\\nwould constitute the ideal bridgehead for the conquest of Italy. The tiny Italian island\\nfrom Pantelleria, located on the way to Sicily,\\nnot far from the Tunisian coast, was a step\\non the road to the main island. With its steep cliffs,\\nPantelleria had been used as an air base\\nand submarine by axis forces. Attacks were launched\\nagainst British ships in Mediterranean\\nfrom this island. According to Winston Churchill,\\nPantelleria, was a thorn in the side and now posed a problem\\nfor the invasion of Sicily. To make sure\\nthat nothing could prevent the success of these men\\nin their mission in Italy, Eisenhower designed a project\\nquite unpleasant for the small island. He and his staff wanted to check if it was possible to weaken\\nsuch a target from the air in order to then be able to\\ninvade it with a reduced force. Pantelleria became a testing ground\\nto observe the effects of a saturation bombardment\\non a well-defended coast. Allied planes began\\nto bomb the small island from May and during\\nthe following five weeks. More than 500 bomber raids\\nwere carried out and 6300 tons of bombs dropped\\non Italian and German troops. The barracks, the depots\\nand the planes were hit at the Pantelleria airfield, while the ships\\nBritish combat opened fire on the port\\nand on the gun emplacements along the coast. On June 10,\\nthe offensive reaches its climax. Whole waves of bombers\\ntake off from Tunisia, bombarding the island day and night,\\nstopping only to give time to the Allies to invite\\nthe island to go to. Simultaneously from Washington, Roosevelt urged\\nthe Italians to overthrow Mussolini. Those who wanted to get rid\\nof the dictator were numerous, but they were going to stay\\nin power for a while longer. In Pantelleria,\\nno surrender having taken place, a British infantry division\\nleft the Tunisian coast on board landing ships. Around 11 a.m.,\\non June 11, an allied plane spotted\\na white cross on the airfield just before the infantry\\narrives on the beach. It was the first time in history\\nthan enemy territory only capitulated\\nfollowing a bombing, even before the troops\\nhave not set foot on the ground. The operation had proven\\nthat the Allies were not joking. Eisenhower could now\\nfocus on preparations of the invasion of Sicily. On the other side of the globe,\\nin the Pacific theater of operations, events were accelerating. The Allies resumed\\nsupremacy over the seas. As an island nation,\\nJapan depended on maritime relations with the rest of the world, and that's it\\nwho had led him to war. When the United States imposed\\nsanctions in Japan regarding supply\\nin raw materials, the Empire of the Rising Sun\\nhad no other choice than fighting for survival. In 1943, the Japanese having to defend\\nand administer new territories were confronted\\nto considerable difficulties. It was vital for them that\\nmaritime connections are maintained, allowing the sending of troops and ammunition up to\\nmost isolated southern garrisons. The attack on Pearl Harbor\\nin December 1941, during which\\nmany American ships had been destroyed\\nor put out of action, had been an entry\\nin shattering war for Japan. These troops encountered only a few\\nof opposition in the conquest of the islands around the Pacific. Their enemies still in shock, the Japanese did\\neverything that was possible to take advantage\\ntheir success at Pearl Harbor. Japanese submarine crews\\nwere particularly well trained. They were equipped\\nlong lance torpedoes. They had shown themselves\\nmuch more effective than that of American submarines,\\noften victims of failure. These did not explode\\non impact or explode before reaching their target, or followed\\naberrant trajectories. The American military\\nwere more and more concentrated on technologies\\nand the tactics that could ensure their superiority\\non the Japanese in the Pacific. The events of Pearl Harbor\\nshowed them that they were not at the end of their\\npains before achieving this result. At first\\nof the Pacific War, the commanders\\nAmerican submarines knew they were poorly prepared\\nto the battles that awaited them. American military decision-makers\\nfinally heard their voice and in 1943,\\ndesigned new torpedoes, developing a model with\\na more powerful payload. The Americans would benefit\\nthe effect of surprise on their enemies and tilt the fate\\nfights in their favor. Applying\\nbold tactics, the Americans launched\\nsurprise attacks against ships\\nJapanese merchants. This strategy\\nwas quickly extended. It turned out to be very effective,\\nbecause US Navy submarines, become more\\nmore daring, attacked as close as possible to the surface\\nrather than from the depths. A year ago,\\nthe code breakers had succeeded to decipher the codes\\nof the Japanese Navy. Now they provided\\nmore precise information to the submarine commander\\nregarding the positions possible targets on the surface. As a result, submarines\\nAmericans were equipped with radar making it possible to detect\\nthe ships in their vicinity, while the patrols, spotted the submarines\\nJapanese diving. The pace of attacks on ships\\nJapanese increased significantly throughout 1943, the Americans attacking\\nas many military ships that merchant ships\\nand even fishing fleets. Slowly, but inexorably,\\nthe allies regained control in the rough waters of the Pacific. General Douglas MacArthur, supreme commander of the forces\\nAllies in the South West Pacific, represented for the Japanese an implacable enemy at sea,\\nin the air and on the ground. Ensure air superiority\\nwas a constant concern in the South Pacific, where American troops\\nand Australians were now progressing more and more inside\\nfrom the southern perimeter limit Japanese possessions. At the beginning of June, Admiral William Halsey ordered\\nthe attack on new Georgia, the largest island in the west of the islands\\nSolomon, who was immediately north of Guadalcanal. The Americans had been warned\\nthat the Japanese were building an airfield in Munda, the largest colony\\nof new Georgia. Air attacks\\nagainst American troops would have represented\\na significant danger. The Japanese, for their part,\\nfeared that if the Americans managed to hold Guadalcanal, this would give them a starting point\\nfor operations to reconquer the islands one after the other\\ntowards the north of the Solomons. This would put\\nthe strategic base of Rabaul on the island of New England,\\ncrucial for the Japanese under the threat\\ndirectly from the Americans. Everything Japan\\ncould try to stop American forces in their advance\\nwas considered a priority. Although the Japanese attacks\\nagainst Guadalcanal has little chance of moving\\nthe Americans from their position, they disturbed them, but the American advance\\ntowards Rabaul does not slow down. The Marines landed\\nat the southern tip of new Georgia, left defenseless and started\\nto advance towards the port of Viry. Without waiting to have eliminated\\nthe Japanese garrison strong of more than 10,000 men\\nwho occupied the rest of the island, they started\\nto build an airfield where they had landed. Allied planes\\nbased on this new airfield provided them with air support\\ninvaluable in their fight to conquer the whole\\nof new Georgia. When Munda Air Base\\nfell into the hands of the allies, few weeks later, the troops of Guadalcanal, who always fought last\\nbastions of Japanese resistance, were a little relieved. Japanese bombing attempts\\nAmerican positions on Guadalcanal from their base in New Georgia\\nallowed us to imagine the problems to whom were going\\nbe confronted by the troops if we gave the Japanese time\\nto consolidate their positions in the newly conquered territories. Japanese culture\\nto never give up your arms meant that every square kilometer\\nof territory in the Pacific, on land or sea,\\nwould be defended to the death. The Allies had a goal\\nterribly difficult to reach. The cost in terms of lives sacrificed\\nwas going to become impressive, but it was the price to pay to end expansionism\\nJapanese in the Pacific. A heavy price also had to be paid\\nto defeat Hitler in Europe. The war also took\\nits due on civilian populations everywhere in proportion\\nwhich were going to become unbearable. England continued\\nto suffer Luftwaffe raids. In every country\\nunder the boot of the Führer, the terror was permanent. The reports\\nthe atrocities committed were terrible. On the military level,\\nthe immediate concern of the Allies was the landing in Sicily. Several questions\\nremained unresolved, especially those\\nwhich concerned the political reaction when they landed in Italy. The conquest of Italy\\nwould allow us to appreciate to what extent those who had\\nadhered to Hitler's utopia would be able\\nto turn against it.\",\n",

       " 'We are BIRDWATCHERS We are connected by birds: large and smaller, gray and colorful, common and rare. This passion pushes us to various strange behaviors: we willingly get up before dawn to listen to the birds singing at sunrise, we travel tens, sometimes hundreds of kilometers without hesitation to see for a moment a species of bird that we have never seen before. Going to the sea we are really happy that there is a storm and we look at the sky more often than others. Is it a hobby, passion or rather a way of life? PART I - And that is cool, when you stay here for three months... And life in there is...  slow. - It is obvious, you need to get up early in the morning, sometimes even before dawn. There is a lot of work, sometimes you need to stay in the woods until evening. -  When I was young I really wanted to work like David Attenborough, and then I had... Well, I had many dreams and targets: while I was studying biology I wanted to work in the lab, but i quickly abandoned that desire. I fell in love with the work in the forest. -I lead the researches in the Bialowieza Forest, they concern factors conditioning Robin\\'s breeding success. Robin is rather inscrutable bird. - It\\'s really hard to find it\\'s nest - it\\'s amazingly secretive bird in breeding season. Furthermore, he can deceive. If he feels watched,  he carries the nest material to the place, which can be located even fifty meters away from the real nest. - In the half of June, last Robins abandons their nests. - Right now we need to check, whether the whole Robin family left the nest. - We will need a ladder for this. - Oh, that is a wolves pack\\'s job, which walks here on the edge of the forest. It can be seen, that they had a feast few months ago. That corpse is a Red deer - probably a doe. - The voices of the birds are also used to catch the males. We place a speaker near the special net, we play mating voice of the male. Birds in the area are getting upset and they want to find the source of the sound and they fall right into special ornithological net, which is almost invisible in the dark forest. The birds need some time to represent their song. - Then they are getting closer and closer, to the moment when they find the source of the sound and fall into the net, where speaker is located. - The most important sense in the forest is the hearing. Birds communicate with the contact voices, but the most important is the singing. It informs females about the condition of the male, - is it worth setting up a nest with him. This is also a signal for the males: \"This is my territory and do not look in there.\" - It\\'s worth mentioning, that the Robin is amazingly plastic when it comes to nest sites. It can make a nest at the ground, under the ferns, in the hollow at the height of one and half meters, or in the hollow on the twelve or fifty meters, - There is an example of nest which Robin claims. It\\'s a gap in a narrow lime tree. There are visible traces after a woodpecker. - Durning the research of Robins we also find nests of different birds, which make nests in really incredbile places. By the way, we found a Treecreeper\\'s nest. They form their nests between bark: these are very unstable constructions. As you can see, it\\'s withering, well already dead spruce. Behind a piece of the bark you can see potruding spruce twigs. It\\'s a sign for us, that there is a Treecreeper\\' s nest and the chicks are in it. - Yes, Patryk is coming - Do you hear alarmed Red-Breated Flycatcher calls? Worrying? - Białowieża Forest, including Białowieża National Park is a place of occurrence of more than two hundred fourty species of birds. - If we realize, that in whole Poland occurrence of four hundred fifty species was identified, then we have more than half of birds identified in this place. - In the whole Great Britain there barely are seventy five species of breeding forest birds, while there is about one hundred twenty. The fact of the species numbers makes this forest special. - Some time ago whole Europe, whole european lowlands looked just like place where we are currently standing, we are experiencing journey into the past. - From Patryk Rowiński\\'s iniciation I have started my PhD research with Kasia Kanclerska. It was about Robin. And now, here we are in our Byzantium, in our old Białowieża shack. Patryk wanted to have a nice little house right over there, under the forest, so we rent it for three months. We are renting it from the end of March to the beginning of the June. - In march, when the bison stays in the open area, they are walking very close to us. Even one bison with transmitter was eating something behind the meadow. We have got here few Red-backed Shrikes, River Warblers and Corncrakes. Corncrakes are getting at the latest from our neighbours. There is beautiful, there is fantastic, you can fall in love. - We are spending whole spring in te field. We see everything change, how in the beginning undergrowth is getting colors just to the late spring, early summer when everything turns green in the forest and you can see nothing. - We have D4 to ring, ring in K1 and nest to pick in M5, anything else? - Let\\'s go to the K1 first, its the furthest one. - There is shortcut over here, there is that little swamp, otherwise we would have to go around. - There, it doesn\\'t look bad... but there... but there... - I think we must walk on the log. - Kaśka, help! - It ends up like this when I use shortcuts. - It always end up like this. - Come on, let\\'s go, I\\'m getting cold and I need to warm up. -You know what, last time I had birds circling around with hood over here. - There is a small hollow, I think he would fit in it. - I fell little bit different, and sometimes I feel treated by society just like weirdo. And it\\'s weird for me. Everyone needs some closeness to the nature. Everyone feels better in the forest, feels good at the meadow, everyone relaxes then. - This is somewhere around there, so we can look around. - Do you need flashlight? - This is the last nest in season, season is about to end. Exactly now the chicks are hatching. It\\'s an amazing moment when tiny Robins comes out from eggs, - We have six eggs and two chicks are already hatching. - We will come back here. Sunrise at spring Biebrza and Narew\\'s backwaters is a breathtaking sight. Intensive birds migration lasts here at spring. River, like highway for birds is a corridor where first herds of geese and ducks fly. Then Lapwings, Golden Plovers, or the most spectacular ones - Battalions. The Battalions are real symbol of Biebrza. Herds counting of tens are stopping here to prey, and various colorful males are carrying battles and fights. For many years ornithologists are trying to recognize and describe birds\\' summer migration. it\\'s a difficult task. Especially, that the most of species willingly migrates on the cloudless nights, having only moon\\'s location and stars constellations to guide their way. Nowadays, naturalists are being helped by modern technology. Thanks to it, we can try to precisely examine migration, which were hidden from human\\'s eye till now. - So what? We are getting back inside? It\\'s surprising that the radar used on the ships has became helpful tool for the ornithologists. - Most of the people treats it as...  device for recognition of the flying objects, UFO\\'s; they treat us a little bit like people from space, space research station. - Of course, always when we tell people that we are examining something that is closest to human-nature, interest arises, how we can without any interference, remotely discover that nature and build knowledge. - Come on! - We must separate vertical radar\\'s working area. Vertical radar works on height of five meters, unfortunately, it can still reach human\\'s head. So to prevent accident, we always separate radar\\'s working place. - Rafał, maybe we need to refuel? Over! - We will be able to launch the servers in a while. I just need to connect to the power and these few servers. Such a bunch of wires... - Ok, now - Alright - It\\'s not working. No, it`s ok. - Oh, there is it. - Ok. Cool, cool. - Oh! Doggy! Hey, you came to work? - In this moment I\\'m setting up an audio recording and I will check the sound recording\\'s level. It\\'s important to separate as much noise as we can, and lose as much as possible from that, what is in front of us in area and that, what microphone have to capture. - The device behind us is called 3Bird Radar System. It\\'s made up of two marine antennas, which are sending electromagnetic waves, and then identify objects in area. In this case we are using it to register birds\\' flights. In this way we can check what happens in every second at three hundred sixty degrees around us and five kilometers above us at the moment. - The selection of place is crucial in our examination. At the moment, we are by the river, so we can examine birds flight very well in the river valley. Radar works like a flashlight, big spotlight. I\\'m sure that if I would lamp giant spotlight towards that forest, that\\'s what is happening behind the forest will be invisible. If we had to deal with high flights of big birds, in this moment we will surely register them in  area behind the forest. - The flock of Ruffs just flew, there is probably next flock. - Rafał, will we try to track them? - They are low... ...meter, maybe half above water. - Alright, I saved it in base. - An interesting flock flew by there, to South. - Here, on the screen we can see the velocity of moving object, in this case a bird, because we are watching birds. We can see the distance, which they have travelled from the registering moment. We can also see their height, if they are moving in the field of the beam of the vertical radar. - Ruffs  have a speed of sixteen meters per second today. - And here we have got another flock. Oh, here is it. It\\'s two hundred twenty meters away from us, isn\\'t it? We can see them really intensively on the radar. - If the system detects groups of pixels, which are moving in one direction, we detect it as a birds flock. Here, it marks as blue. We can see, that it\\'s surely something really huge. The red colour means that we have a big bird, it\\'s more like it doesn\\'t herding character. Orange ones - they are medium sized birds, and yellow are the smallest ones. - In night hours there are many birds flying by, and with help of radar we can examine them, and count. We can also measure the height of the flights. - Species of the birds we are trying to recognize by the audio recordings. We are making them by using directional microphone. We are pointing it up, and waiting for the intensive night migration occurrence. Usually, these migrations are appearing hour or two after the sunset. These are very frequent flights, reaching about one thousand, or one thousand five hundred meters above the ground. We aren\\'t able to observe them in any method. Radar is the only available tool, available technology, that we can freely use for such purposes. - And what? Something happens? - It looks like a trend reserved a little bit. The fact remains, that the trend of flights in the direction of Biebrza has ceased, but the first, flights to the south are more common, and second, are directing to the direction of Narew. - Yes - And that\\'s interesting. Look, see? - Hmmm, really. - Like the trend has reversed. - We can see now that the river valley is less intensively used by birds that are migrating by day. There are no clear flights in the North direction, however the activity of smaller birds has appeared. It can be also bats activity, which characterizes, by groups of, which are flying really slowly, from one to three meters per hour. - I used to lie on such a meadow at night. I was looking at starry sky and I was thinking: damn, only me and the stars. From a certain time I know, that I am not alone. That between me and the stars there is also really intensive traffic. Magical Podlasie in spring is even more beautiful than ever Rivers Biebrza and Narew generously spill their waters on the nearby meadows, which are waking up to live from the winter slumber. Man has lived here for centuries, with symbiosis with nature. His leisurely lifestyle was suit by seasons and spilling river. We are lucky, that we can still be witness of this spectacle of nature. PART II - Come one, come one, come one, right there - We came to this place around 1998/2000 and the first we did, was the land buyout because the most of the area we can see around us is a property of PTOP (Polish Society for the Protection of Birds) As we have already bought some land, there’s a small river right behind us. It’s called Rudnia and it used to flow different way It was a simple channel, dug straight to the river. We have decided to recreate Rudnia’s old riverbed, and river went back to that old riverbed From 200 meters of simple channel it became 2 kilometres of flowing river - So it’s like natural island? - Yes. It’s a natural island, island which is located just between Rudnia’s river mouth and Narew river. Podlasie. From spring to autumn at the meadows looked after by PTOP cows and horses are being grazed. This type of grazing allows to restore and maintain breeding places of waders the ones that are the most endangered: Lapwings, Redshanks and Black-tailed Godwits. -We are beginning grazing season at our meadows. The first herds of polish horses and polish red cows has arrived. - Why are they separated? - There are few reasons. First, we need to have a proper stocking density. That means that birds can’t have too much or not enough animals. And that’s why we are trying to regulate the stocking density, so given number of hectares owns proper number of animals. Second, it’s in case of various situations: sometimes our fences can be damaged by a Bison or an Elk. It’s easier to control few groups. If one group escapes, it always moves towards its neighbours and asks “Hey, may we join you?”, and they’re staying with the other group, so we don’t need to run after around the woods. Third, natural groups are never huge. They usually are up to 10 horses. So if we accumulated all our 50 horses in one group, it would be kind of weird. -These are Polish Primitive Horse and Polish Red Cattle. They’reprimitive breeds so they are excellently dealing with this difficult terrain. It’s not a good forage. It’s sedge and reed, so it’s not high-quality grass. Other races or other horses wouldn’t eat this willingly but they… - As you can see, they are now eating that sedge, \\nas they will start eating this youngreed in few moments. And that’s what we wanted - the shape of habitat is changing. - After introducing the grazing, the amount of waders in this area has tripled. There are Common Snipe, Lapwings, Redshanks, Black-tailed Godwits.\\nReally nice squad of birds. We have mowed area before, but the grazing helped the best \\nand the amount is three times bigger than it was before. - After grazing there are also general birds like Starlings, Pipits, Wagtails, Whinchats \\nand many, many more species. There’s so many birds around the horses, because where the grass is grazed, \\nit’s like a cafeteria for them. Majority of people doesn’t associate grazing of cow and horses with nature conservation. Meanwhile, thanks to the cows and horses favourable habitats are being created. Lapwings eagerly builds their nests in low grass, and trampled by cows small swamps \\nare good for Black-tailed Godwits or Great Snipes. Grazing is an so-called active conservation, that is, actions performed by human \\nthat lead to restore convenient conditions for nature. - It will be also feeding grounds of White Storks that will be walking with these animals in a while. The first Stork has already arrived today. Moreover, Lesser Spotted Eagles which are breeding nearly are also fond of grazed area, \\nso it serves many species. - What are our biggest problems? We have released horses and cows today, and what now? \\nNobody controls them? How does it look like? Surely there’s some kind of supervision over what’s happening here from your side. Right? - We have hired a person, who supervises all the pastures. He’s probably walking somewhere here at the other side at the moment. \\nWe have hired this man from nearby town. Of course, we also have to be here from time to time, and check if the herd did not run away\\nand often catch them and bring them back. Things happens. - How long horses are staying here? Surely all the summer… - They’re here all the grazing season. They are leaving in October, at the end of it. - They’re leaving in October, but everything really depends of two things: how fast they eat, and, we are in the floodplain valley of Narew river. This river changes its shape a little… Well, not a little, and it shapes our decisions in a great extent. Last year there was a really wet autumn, so the animals left earlier. If it’s dry, they can stay longer. So the river tells us: “it’s the time” or “ we’ll wait a little longer”. - It’s the same thing with spring. We can let animals in only when the water goes down. That valley there is flooded in March and April. \\nIn May water goes down, and we can release the animals. -There’s something going. What’s that?\\n-These are cows. - Where are they going?\\n- Mr Darius, you will wait, there’s a traffic jam over there. - Alright. Mr Waldek must wait, he needs to go back there. - He needs to unload first. - At the moment there’s four of them near lodging. \\n- Or five? - What about the“collision” between birds nest and an animal, like for example horse, won’t horse destroy this nest? - There’s such a small stocking density right now, it’s maybe half a horse per hectare. There are also only a few pairs of birds, o it’s rather unlikely that any animal will accidentally step onto the nest. There’s a bigger problem with predators, both these from air and ground such as: Foxes, Mink and a Raccoon Dog that are destroying nests. - It’s not only a matter of birds. The insects, amphibians, and everything that lives there; they are all benefiting from this. - As we know, the Fire-bellied Toads are also often staying at grazing areas. - Some might say: “The horses, the transports. \\nAre they worth it? One lawn mower would be enough”. - First of all, there would be fewer birds, because we would use and mow these fields. Second, we would be having many problems with picking up the hay. These are wet terrains. If it rains in June, we are not able to collect the dry hay, and all the fields would have to remain with the biomass on the top, \\nwhich would be bad for the habitats. Besides that, we are creating some kind of mosaic, so the terrain looks different. Getting rid of the reed is also progressing. There was no difference after the mowing. The reed always grew back. And now after few years of grazing, there’s like half less of it. So it really works. Area of the pastures where horses and cows of the PTOP are grazing is getting bigger all the time. At the moment it’s almost five hundreds hectares of fields in North East Poland. The more terrains, the bigger is the change for successful breeding of more rare species. Let’s hope, that thanks to these actions, \\nlater generations will also get the chance to enjoy spring sounds of birds. Beskid Niski Mountains. One of the last, really wild places in Poland. It’s not a surprise, that it attracts everyone fascinated with nature, including bird lovers. Through the low Beskid mountains, the trail of migration stretches, so for over thirty years ornithologists are conducting their researches there. - We are at “Akcja Carpatica” camp, where we are catching birds for the twentieth time. It’s the twentieth season of studies of birds migrations just right there at Beskid Niski, around the Myscowa village. We have one hundred mist-nets altogether, placed at all spots. It’s rather a big amount, but it gives us desired effects, if it comes to numbers of caught birds. Functioning of the camps strongly depends on the count of the crew. Everyone has their own tasks, their own duties. Dinner has to be made, someone has to wash the dishes. There must be designated people, who will do the rounds every hour. - This morning we were sitting, and suddenly some man riding a bike asked us: “gentleman, may I ask you to come over there for a moment?” We came out expecting a request for 5 Złoty, or a beer, and he straight goes like: “Don’t you want to buy a goat?” We liked it. Kasia also said, that it’s likely pregnant. Unfortunately I haven’t heard that. - He also touched it, and stated that it will be a billy. - Yes. We are expecting, that when we wake up tomorrow, \\nthere will be a small goat running around the camp. It’s slowly getting used to us. It’s name’s Iskra (Spark). - We are in the Magurski National Park, specifically in its buffer zone. Behind us, we can see a mountain called Kamień (Stone). It’s mostly an area of strict protection. These areas are protecting the last remnants of Carpathian primeval forest, beech forests with an admixture of the fir which is a typical forest habitat in the Carpathians. - Oh, I think that’s a Lesser Spotted Eagle. But it’s far away, at large height. You can tell by characteristically arched wings. They are arched downwards, this is how You distinguish a Lesser Spotted Eagle from a Golden Eagle. More and more bird`s enthusiasts arrive to Magurski National Park. Whether they’re called Birdwatchers, or bird lovers. Mentioned eagles: Lesser Spotted Eagle and Golden Eagle, are our flagship species over here. You don’t have to try hard to see Lesser Spotted Eagle there. All you have to do is to take a few-hour walk around April, August or on the beginning of September, and you will probably see some of them, and surely you will hear at least a few. Lesser Spotted Eagle is quite active vocally. There won’t be any problems with it. It’ll be little harder with Golden Eagle which is very rare in our country. Here we have two territories of this species and to see it You need more luck. It would be best to go around village of Myscowa, which is located outside the National Park. And above that town, above the Wisłoka valley, above the nearby meadows and pastures, Golden Eaglefly relatively often. We protect these forests, not only because of the forest itself, but also because of animals that inhabit them. Starting from small passerines, such as Collared Flycatcher, Red-breasted Flycatcher, White-backed Woodpecker, or there where’s more fir, even Three-toed Woodpecker. Through owls, that is: Pygmy Owl, Tengman’s Owl, until lager birds. As it comes to owls, Ural Owl is currently the most numerous owl in Beskid Niski. - The most important thing at ringing camp is the safety of birds. Birds are pulled out of the nets. Pulling the bird out usually takes several seconds. Sometimes three seconds. Sometimes it takes up to a minute, if the bird is tangled. Then it’s placed into special bag and transported. The bag is airy, and it’s quite dark inside, so bird’s the stress will be reduced. And of course, after taking to the camp, \\nwe’re doing best we can to finish the procedures as soon as possible. We take biometrical measurements, and ring the bird. Then it is being released. - At 17:00 o’clock: k3, X07, 42, re-trapped - Catching in the mistnets is safe for birds. If the rounds are properly concentrated, that’s like every hour in good conditions. When it’s heavy raining, or sun is blazing the rounds will be more frequent, or the nets will be closed. - We catch highest amounts of birds in hours between six and nine at the morning. In the afternoon, the second wave is coming from seventeen to eighteen. That’s when the most of birds are being caught. - 95% of the area of the Magurski National Park is covered with forests. The rest, almost 5% are the meadows and pastures. The Park mows and grazes these areas with sheep or cows, to preserve these open landscapes. Not only the forests, but also open landscape, for the panoramic and most importantly - natural reasons. Nature hates compromises. We protect it, or we don’t. In places where we want to protect it, human must make concessions. Sadly people often do not realise, that it’s the heritage of their whole country, and wider, even whole Europe. It’s easier than we think to protect nature. All we have to do is to leave it alone, and it will take care of herself, especially in places untouched by human hands. PART III Poland. A real paradise for birds lovers. We are begging our adventure at its northern edge, where Sobieszewska Island lies. In summer, first ferry arrives here just after sunrise. From there, it’s only a few kilometres of walk to the Mewia Łacha Nature Reserve, where the Water bird Research Group „Kuling” builds their cabin every year. - We are at the mouth of Vistula river, exactly around breakwaters leading a river to the sea. - Hello. Anything interesting? Any birds? - Welcome, everything’s fine. - When your round starts? - Well, they went out. The round has already begun, so we will wait for birds. Crew is coming back. In special baskets they’re carrying birds caught into walk-in traps. Caught birds can’t wait too long, so under a watchful eye of supervisor, the ringing begins. - I’m a ringer on Kuling camps for over twenty years. Kuling started to use these plastic rings on waders \\nbecause they’re making reading them a lot easier for observers. Lately we all have a high quality cameras, scopes, so a lot of people enjoy reading these rings. We don’t have to catch that bird again, and we can easily read it’s number that allows us to know it’s history, without even scaring that animal. Then this number goes to the special database, so we can learn about its life history. - And there, where are these sticks? It’s also a nest or not? - Just over here. You can see two eggs. That’s Little Tern nest. - They’re being hatched, despite the cluch is not full. - Yes, they’re only two. But it’s twelfth day, so they will hatch out soon enough. - It’s one of a few nests. It’s a bad season for Terns, because of large amounts of predators at the other side of Vistula. Unfortunately Foxes and Racoon Dogs started to come earlier, and we couldn’t exterminate them successfully, so the whole colony got away. The only successful broods to the moment of incubation were here, at the headland. Only trained crew of Kuling are allowed to move around the Reserve. This season, to protect Ringed Plover broods from predators, Kuling is using special baskets. - Ah, it’s beginning. It pretends to have broken wings. Plover is getting away from us, trying to distract us from the nest. Distracting’s aim is to get any predator away from the nest, by getting away from it and pretending to for example have a broken wing. The predator will think it’s an easy prey, so it will start to chase a bird. - And the nest remains safe.\\n- Yes. Nest remains safe. - Here we can see the nest inside the basket. There are four eggs, so it’s a full clutch. Now we will start to get away rather quickly, to not worry the bird further, so it can return and hatch the eggs. - It’s another pair of Terns. - Waders are a very interesting group, primarily because of their longest migrations of all birds in the world. Our rings were read even in Mauritania. But the longest ones were to Ghana and South Africa. It’s a few thousands kilometres from the place where they were ringed. If we imagine from where these birds are flying, somewhere from Siberia, these birds can fly up to twelve thousands kilometres in one migration. Stops are a very important elements of migration. During them, the birds can rest and feed in order to gain strength for further journey. Here, at Vistula’s river mouth, we have a Reserve which we are closing from tourists, so birds can gather these resources in peace, and then deal with their further flight. - I’m an educator here, and my job here is to teach tourists. On the observation platform I show them what’s there in the Reserve, I tell them about our duties, and what and how we are protecting. A lot of people asks me if it is true that it’s really forbidden to enter there, because they would love to have a short walk there. I certainly explain them, how important it is to not disturb structure of the Reserve. Meanwhile, during the round, a surprise awaits Ania and Andrzej. - We have two chicks of Little Tern, I’ll go for the rings and get back soon as I can. - They’re perfectly adapted to hide within a sand. It seems that it’s rather flat there, without any grasses, so they would be easy to find. But if we released them right now, and they got away, I think it would be a huge problem to find them. - The chicks are already big enough to be ringed. The second chick is also ringed. It will be free in a moment. - Are we releasing them together?\\n- Yes. Breeding season is ongoing, so we shouldn’t be here. But presence of the camp with people, which is scaring foxes leads first broods to be successful. All May and June, these chicks weren’t hatching, because they were eaten. And now we’ve got a camp here for around two and half week, and two broods have already hatched. These are birds which laid eggs at the beginning of camp. - There are another two birds. Yes, two Dunlins in a walk-in trap. Vistula river mouth is a very precious place for birds, substantially every season. At the moment we are having a very specific period of time, because the breeding season is still ongoing, so there are birds which use these terrains to breed. But for other species, migration has already begun. We are mainly talking about birds flying from North \\nand North-East and we are observing these among others. These traps, which we are setting here at camp, are used to catch waders. There aren’t many places like Mewia Łacha Nature Reserve left in Poland. It’s a tiny piece of land left to a nature. But isn’t it to small? Would human pressure become too strong there? People often accuse us of closing that beach for ourselves. Actually closing a terrain, not letting people in guarantees these birds some peace, for example to stop during their migration. We all must realize, that protection of these places doesn’t allow compromises. Tourism must be controlled, and presence of Kuling’s crew is its best guarantee. Today we say goodbye to Kuling’s camp and Vistula river mouth, but we will return soon to uncover more secrets of this place. From Sobieszewska Island we move to the east. To Podlasie, where together with Pawel from Eagle Conservation Commitee, we are heading in the direction of wet forest. - Hi\\n- Great, I’m looking forward to our job. Where is that nest? This way? - Nest is very close, in this forest, in some kind of swampy lowering, hidden in spruce. Wet Podlasie’s forests are magical place. Lesser Spotted Eagles eagerly build their nests here. Mostly close to the edge of forests, surrounded by meadows, close to their feeding grounds. Protecting birds of prey, including the Lesser Spotted Eagle, is the Eagle Conservation Committee’s task. - Let it be romantic. I launch myself across the dry and open narrows. My carriage plunging into green as if a ketch, Floundering through the meadow flowers in the stretch. I pass anarchipelago of coraly arrows.. At Eagle Conservation Commitee, we mostly take care of birds of prey, but also of owls and Black Stork. We mostly work with the zone protection and monitoring of birds of prey, that is, searching for rare species. - You said that it’s here. - Two chicks are hatching right now. - Montagu’s Harriers are making their nests on the ground, usually in cereal fields. We are trying to find that kind of broods before the harvest. We often ask owners of these lands for permission to secure these nests, or for a little delay of harvests. - We are ringing today, are we? - That’s our goal. I hope the chick will be there, I’ve checked the nest and it’s occupied, and if everything went fine we will find a chick to ring there. - And what, is it here? - Here. The nest is barely visible. On the top of that spruce. It’s one of the best nests, because every year we can find a young bird here. Presence of the chick is evidenced by fresh droppings, and adult Lesser Spotted Eagles do not defecate near their nests. - There’s one or two chicks? - It’s quite early, so theoretically there it’s possible to find two chicks here. But cainism, when an older and stronger chick kills a weaker siblings occurs early, so I’d rather expect to find one bird here. One time I had an occasion to see a cainism. The older chick, which was around two and half week tormented a younger one. Younger’s head was covered in blood, and the eye was missing. Quite a sad view. But it’s natural for Lesser Spotted Eagles. It’s a huge species, the chick weight around 1500 grammes. So in 8 weeks Lesser Spotted Eagle have to raise a 1500 gramme chick, \\nfeeding it small prey such as voles, amphibians and other chicks. -  Now it knows that we are here, but it sometimes responds from far away. That’s how I found the nest. I heard the chick, because the nest was too hard to see. While finding a new position, we apply to Regional Directorate \\nof Environmental Protection for creating so-called protection zones. These are areas, where birds aren’t disturbed. Year-round zone secures all tree stand, chosen by the birds for a nest. That is about one or two hundred meters of area around the nest, depends on the species. But partial protection zone, is a much larger area, but it’s functioning only in a breeding season. - It’s still small, so it doesn’t resist at all. It’s probably around 3 weeks old. There’s no second chick in the nest, and there aren’t any traces or shells. It’s hard to say if there were two eggs, or only one, both options are possible for Lesser Spotted Eagles. We usually put two rings on them. One is standard ornithological metal ring, the second one is a colourful plastic ring for reading. - I can see it’s getting rid of down feathers. - Yes, that’s why we can see down in the nest. If there’s much of it, it means that the bird was medium sized, and changed its plumage. Down is well visible on resin trees, such as spruces. It sticks to them, so we are able to tell if the chick was there even in December. This red colour is reserved for Lesser Spotted Eagles in Poland. Short three-digit code. We are often able to read it from the photos, even of birds in flight. - It will of course try to defend itself a little. It’s big enough to recognize threats, but his defence won’t be enough at the moment. If it comes to Lesser Spotted Eagles, we know a lot about their migrations thanks to telemetry. For me, really precious information are about natal dispersal, \\na distance between eagle’s place of hatch to its first nesting site. It’s very interesting, eagles are long distance migrants. Their migrations can be up to eleven thousands kilometres, \\nto place like South Africa and they always return close to their birth place. The chick is being ringed. It has little time to put on some weight and grow feathers. From hatching to flying from nest, about fifty days passes. Young Lesser Spotted Eagle is up to one more difficult task - he must learn how to fly and hunt. Between August and September he will experience an unusual feeling. It will be a migratory restlessness, which will force it to fly southwards, to distant wintering grounds. - It’s amazing, that non-flying chick which is lying ahead of us, \\nat the end of September should be somewhere in Africa. - Well I guess he won’t be in Africa at the end of September, \\nthat’s the time when he will just begin his journey. He’ll maybe be somewhere in Near East. - We should put him back as fast as possible. - He began to call. - You’re going up with me. - All the best. - Average breeding success is around 70%. It’s not much, but I think not more than 50% of birds will survive first winter. With every next year the survival change is getting bigger, but sadly many of them won’t make it to their first reproduction \\nwhich occurs when they are around five years old. The chick must return to its nest as soon as possible. There’s a parent calling his offspring nearby. Young Lesser Spotted Eagle’s well-being is a priority for ornithologist. There we say goodbye to our young hero. Maybe we will meet again somewhere at extensive meadows of Podlasie, Lubelszczyzna, or Carpathans. Rings which it received will allow us to identify him. PART IV Urban jungle. Birds found their place here with extraordinary easiness. High blocks, industrial buildings, mine chimneys; they are all places they eagerly use. Variety of birds which got used to live in the city is impressive. Jays, Starlings, Blackbirds, Collared Doves, Magpies, Jackdaws and Black Redstarts. But there’s only one hero of urban sky. Often mistaken with a swallow – the Swift, which liked tall blocks of huge metropolises. - We are going to check if Swifts are in their nest boxes. In this area we have a lot of insulated buildings. When the blocks are being insulated, they lose their breeding places. As a compensation, we place nest boxes here. It’s late afternoon, early evening - the best time to watch Swifts. They should be getting back from their hunting grounds in a moment. - Swifts are amazing birds living almost everywhere among us, which we often don’t realize. Well, we see some black birds flying overhead and screaming, but we don’t know what exactly it is. Many people thinks that they’re black swallows, but it isn’t true. Swallows or House Martins can also live in a buildings - if they are living in a settlements. They are similar to Swifts, but they aren’t ones. Swifts belong to an different order of birds, they have sickle-like wings, and in contrast to Swallows, they’re whole black or dark brown. Swallow’s belly area is clearly white, while Swift’s remains dark. - Nest boxes are made especially for Swifts are hung on the highest storeys, where nothing sticks out beneath them. When they fly away from nest box, they can jump out of the box, catch air under their wings and begin their flight. Because they’re one of best fliers if it comes to birds, they spent most of their lives in air. For Swifts looking at the world from above, high blocks resemble mountain ridges. It’s a species which used to live only in highest trees or rocky parts of the mountains. Today it’s a bird associated with cities, and it’s sounds are often used in romantic comedies, or other movies taking place in an urban jungle. - Alright, we’ll look somewhere else. - That’s a block we need to check. There we also have new, pretty nest boxes. Birds will have a place to live. During a thermomodernization there was a suspicion that there’s a nest in a gap. Ornithologist supervising the construction had to check that. - Thanks\\n- This way - I must realize what am I seeing. - It seems that nothing is here. You can’t see any traces or anything. I’ve made it to the top and I can’t see nothing. If they weren’t here we would be eaten alive by mosquitoes, or we would need to spray chemicals, which is not good. - Something invented that balance.\\n- Exactly. Everything is for something. Unfortunately human can shake this balance, but nature will be fine. The less we interfere, the better. - In 2012 we made a decision about thermomodernization \\nof 120 buildings placed in theneighbourhood where we are currently at. To keep the records and laws about building \\nand protection of nature we had to investigate local birds. Open holes between large-plate buildings are perfect habitats for Swifts. Ventilated and holed flat roofs are also making a perfect habitats, if birds can get to them. The best pleasure of this summer were the messages from residents, who can relax at their balconies afternoon, without need to chase away the mosquitoes. - From flying from the nest to about 2 years, a Swift spends almost all his time in air. First in Poland, Europe, and then in the middle of August he flies to Africa. They often fly around all the Africa and a part of an ocean, while hunting, eating and sleeping in air. Then it gets back to us next spring, usually in May, and it’s still flying around without nesting. In their second year of life they are looking for appropriate place for a nest. - At the moment we have many buildings around us, which Swifts visualize as rocks. That’s why there’s so many of them in our cities. They’re using our blocks and buildings instead of rocks. That phenomenon is called synurbization. - Sometimes it is quiet here all day, because they are flying somewhere else. Sometimes even several dozen of kilometres from their nests. They can fly from several to hundreds of kilometres chasing insects or other invertebrates, catching them with their huge mouths. During 24 hours they can catch to several thousand mosquitoes. - Birds adapted well to the urban jungle. Some of the birds even took advantage of us living in that, not other places. They’re using blocks as their nesting place, and they’re doing well, but with our help they can do even better. Gdańsk Bay, one of the most attractive places for birdwatchers. Birds are intensively migration here at spring and autumn, and from December to March, species from the North winters here: Auks, ducks and loons. Nothing unusual that birders have sentiments to this place. For birdwatchers, the best attractions are winter cruises for birds. They’re giving a chance to see observe species wintering at the sea, away from shore. The group usually hires a small boat. You have to deal with cold, rain and often sea sickness. It’s a kind of extreme observations. - Samek! Why is there so little Common Scoters? - Common Scoters are rather at the West.\\n- We see a lot of Velvet Scoters, Long-tailed Ducks, but few Common Scoters. - During these days, we haven’t seen one. - Further you can see a lot of them, towards a Szczecin or Świnoujście, on Zdenek’ grounds. I always want a whole black duck with white neck. I’ll be happy then. Remember, if you see one, let me know. - And if I see one with something orange? - No, no, no. I don’t want that kind of duck. - Aren’t these Auks? - Auks! On the One o’clock! - You know, it’s hard to keep camera in place, it’s rather heavy. - Great Crested Grebe at Twelve o’clock. It’s swimming. - Adam heard from some fisherman, that he went far from shore \\nand saw some kind of small penguin near a boat. I suppose it was the Little Auk, what else it could be? And Adam told him, that it was Auk. And the fisherman responded, “Man, it wasn’t an Auk, I know how they look like That bird was two times smaller than an Auk”. So we suppose it was a Little Auk. Storm on Baltic. The best weather for birdwatchers. The stronger it is, the better. That’s our chance to see even very rare species that have lost the battle with winds. - We’re leading observation at sea, which is specific form of birdwatching known as seawatching. It’s an unusual activity for ornithologists. It strongly depends on atmospheric and weather conditions. North, North-western winds makes birds willing to migrate, \\nand push them close enough for us to see them. Those aren’t very close distances so seawatching is rather harder than regular birdwatching. You must act rather quickly, which takes a lot of experience and knowledge. And weather conditions themselves. Wind makes everything harder, and it’s cold out there, but it’s worth it. - I have some nice photos. I’ll check them later. It’s fine at the moment. They went to the other side. Keep your heads down, I can’t catch anything. There aren’t a lot of birds. Somewhere single Velvet Scoters passes by. I can’t see many Long-tailed Ducks. And these seagulls - I can watch them at my hometown! - These are Long-tailed Ducks. Aren’t they? - Observing birds at the sea, unlike the other type \\nof the observations can bring us species generally hard to see. In planning seawatching, tracking atmospheric conditions is very important. You need to catch the storm, because it gives best conditions for interesting observation. You must do it every day, to predict which day would be the best. Good conditions, like these today attracts many people. Even people from all parts of Poland, hoping to stand somewhere there, at the Vistula spit and hope to see Skuas, Shearwaters, or Kittiwakes. Often sight of crowd withscopes on the beach arouse interest among tourists and passers-by. They always think that we are making some \\nkind of movie or looking out for maneuvers of the navy. As they find out, that we are watching birds, which is less spectacular for them, they are amazed, that we can stand there in really bad weather \\nand watch for something that will fly far from shore. But in order to know what it really is, you have to taste it once. PART V In the last part, we are trying \\nto answer question we ask ourselves from the beginning. What is and where it comes from – the passion of watching birds. It’s a story about young, but experienced birder, ornithologist and birdwatcher. Exactly, about who? - At the moment birds are more than a passion to me. It’s some kind of addiction - a positive one. I don’t think I could live without it. I can clearly see it when I’m busy for some days and can’t go to the field when I have to study, attend family meetings, or when I’m just ill. I’m constantly nervous. I miss something during the day. Birdwatcher is a person who devotes his time to watch birds, is fascinated by birds, ready to take time just to see them. To see as many as he can find. A kind of person who wants to spend as much time as he can with them, ready to travel hundreds of kilometres, just to see a group of gooses. There’s much more to tell. Umm, wait I don’t know how to say it right. At University of Gdansk we have plenty of ornithologists. And plenty of birdwatchers. Many people, who give their lives to observing and studying birds. It’s a place where organizations like Kuling or Action Baltic have their headquarters. The group I surround myself with, almost every one of them is related to birds. I assume that friendship, or other relationships with people \\nwho don’t share your passion may end sooner or later. I’m not alone at the university. Beside me others are studying here, for example Marta or Marcin, so apart from all professors and doctors, I know people who I can go out with. It’s good for us because we are motivating each other. - 1, 1, 3, 3, 8, 0, 13 - It’s kind of… - Strange?\\n- Yeah, strange. Well… - There’s 0, 0. Female. Age: i. Species: Pa maj. Fat: 2. - Do you remember that Buzzard and Sparrowhawk caught in the net?\\n- Yeah, he ran left and right. - I took a Goshawk and Cuckoo from here once. It’s a nice net. I feel like a birdwatcher and a ringer at the same time. I connect these two fields in one piece, and it’s the best thing for me. It’s my passion, something that I love and will never abandon. It’s what I love. I’m holding a bird in a safe position, where head is placed between middle and pointing finger, and the rest of body is gently covered. We can move other body parts freely. The wing is very important in determining the age, there we look at greater coverts and primary coverts. It’s about a so-called contrast. Edge of these coverts are blue – the same as in greater ones, their tips are round, which suggests that the bird is adult. It’s an adult male of the Great Tit. We can tell by its black belly patch getting bigger while closer to tail. If it was a female, the belly patchwould be shorter and a little white. Male’s head is also metallic black, in case of female it’s feathers are white-edged. That’s how it looks like. Alright, we’re letting him go. The topic of ringing is rather a controversial one, but often because lack of knowledge. Sometimes when we are catching seagulls or ducks in Gdynia’s boulevard, people passing by asks us what, and why, are we doing this. And it’s very good. It’d be worse if they didn’t care, if the lives of birds animals were indifferent for them. I personally haven’t experienced any aggression from people while doing my work. - September 13, 7 o’clock. 1,53. - That how he sounds?\\n- Yes, it’s his contact call. We have also got many visitors at our camps. Not only adults, but children too, who come with their parents or other guardians. They’re my favourite group of listeners. They’re often coming while we are ringing, and I take care of them, talk with them, and let them watch the birds at close range. They’re our future. Who will be later ringing and observing these birds, if not them? These things are simple matters, which must be taken care of now, not later. - I’ll write down every bird we got. - You will dig.\\n- Fair. -That’s our famous toilet sign. There you go, free, and, taken. Quick service course. -There’s a huge contrast, when we are all together. We’re facing different situations within weeks, sometimes getting mad at each other. Some enjoy the food, some not, so small conflicts are often there. But it teaches us cooperation with others, not only at camps, but also in everyday situations. It’s a huge contrast, while you are seeing all these people at studies, \\nnormally dressed, not in all these dirty boots and trousers. -That’s a huge piece of history.\\n- Indeed it is. - You can compare their old look with todays. -That’s the first action notebook, back from 1960, while it wasn’t even called Action Baltic. It was one-time event, led by biology students from University of Warsaw. They placed few nets around reserve called Ptasi Raj (Bird’s Paradise). It wasn’t even a reserve back then. That’s what’s written here: Birds caught in nets, Górki Wschodnie, September 11-24th. A normal, checked notebook, everything written with pencil. There’s first bird. Here you are. - That’s amazing. - It’s Little Stint\\n- Then it’s a Robin - If it comes to identifying birds, there was, I don’t know, maybe 1 guide for whole Europe. There was no Svensson, or anything we use these days back then. - Everything was being invented. - Our boys had to learn all of this by themselves. Well, our girls too of course, there weren’t just boys. - It began with this. I will take our last notebook. It’s our latest L, from Bukowo, now you have comparison, how it looked then, and how it looks today. - Wing 261 - No, there you write EU Q1, then A\\n- Okay. I will correct the ring a little. - It’s my first bird, that I took out of the walk-in trap, black-headed gull At the moment of observation, we don’t pay attention to details, unless we hold them in our hands. Then we can see all their body parts, feathers, and that’s when we examine their age, sex. Many species are hard to recognize in the field, if It comes to their gender and age. But if you are holding them, it all becomes easy. - Everything is clear. An adult bird, without any brown scales. - Tertial coverts, lesser and median. - Okay. So? Three gulls for the photo for the website? - Do you have that plastic covered?\\n- I do - Alright. Enough for today. - It would be great if you brought me a frying pan. - The deep one?\\n- Yes, I need to fry onions. - What’s that knife for? - Agata told that she counted and it was ok. - Were you digging?\\n- We are still, but I need some water. - You sweat so badly.\\n- Yeah - Alvaro in the shirt? Like a corporate worker! - I react really allergically to a word hobby. You can collect stamps as a hobby. Ornithology it`s a sense of life. It`s a vocation. It’s something I think about during a day, and dream during nights. It will power me until death, this is not an single episode in my life. - I think tomorrow will be fine. Last few days were stormy, so a lot of birds will be flying after its end. We have few hours, when birds can move within hundreds of kilometres. - How many hours you were driving to see the Caspian Plover this year? - Well, I’ll categorise it as mental illness. - We were in Tatra Mountains, we were watching birds at Koscieliska Valley, and then, when Szymon joined us, we got a message about presence of Caspian Plover. I remember, that I looked at Werka and said: Damn, that’s the bird I must see. We’ve arrived at campsite, packed our bags, and ran to the bus heading toward Łódź. We’ve arrived around 2 A.M., Sławek picked us, and our five went to see Caspian Plover, somewhere near Gdansk. - So what? To the station?\\n- We’d need 5 minutes. - Alright Igor, I’m listening. - I think we should go right. - Further straight?\\n- Yeah. - Alright then. - In 450 meters, to the right.\\n- Okay. - 200 meters more. - We’ve got around 30 minutes until sunrise. - Maybe we’ll stop? - Quiet now. - Maybe the bird will move, so we can see it. Caspian Plover is a very hard animal to track. - Show me, Michaś. - Here I am. - Oh there, is it. - There is it.\\n- Excellent. - Now it looked slightly to the left. Foraged a bit. - Hi, anything good?\\n- Everything’s fine. - We got it. - Samuel, which species of yours it is? - 310 - 310?\\n- Neatly. - 317.\\n- 310. - 318.\\n- 304. - First twitch by the sea?\\n- I’ve never been that far. - Samuel is a fine example. Yesterday at that hour he was climbing in the mountains. - If you ever go to Pustkowo, there’s exact replica of Giewont’s cross. - And for what did I came to these mountains… - You can go during one day to the same cross. - You still have sea and other mountains to see. - You know, while twitch, there is always the risk that… Well that the bird won’t be there. - You will travel kilometres, lie to your wife, - Then you lie to your boss and get fired and you’re be late 5 minutes for the bird. - I think every one of us had a situation like this. \\n- You have to deal with this. - Today we all have so called lifer, in birders language, simple kick in the ass. - One unslept night. One day of vacation less. Why? Because we were doing a twitch. We went to see a bird that appeared suddenly, and is very rare. First for Poland Caspian Plover in Łaszka, at Pomerania. We went 580 kilometres from Katowice, and in few moments, we will need to beat these kilometres again in order to get back. But it was worth it. Despite the foggy, cold morning, the bird was twitched. Besides that, there were a lot of people from all over Poland. All of them had similar story to ours. Many kilometres travelled just to see that bird. - People often ask us: why birds? Why not mammals, or the reptiles? Why not plants? Our basic and biggest argument is, that these creatures can travel unimaginable distances, without any support. They don’t need any maps or GPS. Sometimes we can even get lost in our cities, and birds \\ncan travel thousands of kilometres, making it to their direction. For example our Storks- they’re flying to South, and from there, they’re flying back directly to their nests. It’s something amazing. Ornithologists aren’t a kind of people sitting in one place, waiting for these birds, spending their time in a boring way. They’re people leading active lifestyle. It’s a life full of emotions and adventures. You will discover many people and places living like this. And there, we need to acknowledge people, tell them, that these birds, which are unimportant and unnecessary for them, can become something more. They can become their passions, something that would change their lives for the better. You become weirdo while breaking the mould. You are someone else in society, unfortunately people are living like moths day by day. Not all of them, but there’s plenty of people without any passions, goals, who don’t even try to find them. I’m trying to live like there’s no tomorrow, but I already have plans for years ahead. These plans are of course linked to birds, and I’m sure that it won’t change. In 10, 20, 30 years I will still go to the field, you will still meet me ringing at the Spit or at Hel in October. These are priorities, which I will never give up. - Pass it on. - It can be found in Poland, in many places. - Roman Snail.\\n- It is indeed, a Roman Snail, Helix pomatia. - What about nervous system, how does it look like? Is it centralized with many ganglia. And what kind of ganglia are they? - Cerebral? Visceral? - Yes. There can also be parietals and sides. It depends on group, but indeed, it’s mostly centralized and ganglia-based. - I often hear in my life, that I should calm down with all these birds. It’s like a cage for me. I don’t like being in such a situations. I feel a lot better there, at the camp, sleeping months under the tent, sitting all days in home staring at TV. It’s definitely not for me. The world goes forward, faster than ever. We have less and less time to breathe. We don’t look at the sky. We don’t live by the rhythm of the nature. Closed in the jungle of concrete we forget how many joy can sunrise, fog swimming around mountain valley, or geese flying on the autumn sky above us. Those who felt passion for birds inside, \\nfound something, something unusual - a key for being happy.',\n",

If you live in Central or Eastern Europe, you probably grew up hearing the folk tale of the three brothers Lech, Czech, and Rus: the three legendary patriarchs of the Slavic peoples. Allowed on a hunting trip the brothers had a disagreement, as brothers do, on which prey to follow, leading them to split up. Czech, the eldest of the brothers, follows prey to the Czech lands Rus, the youngest, went east and became the founder of Russia, and Lech, in the middle founded Poland, because who cares about consistency? The tale differs slightly from place to place, but many include that Lech travelled north as he followed a beautiful white eagle. The eagle landed in its nest at sunset and looked very breathtaking against the red sky. Lech took this for an omen and decided that the land would be his new home. The white eagle is still the symbol of Poland, blazoned against the red sky their flag. Indeed, Poland did begin with Slavic settlements. The Slavs are likely a civilization that emerged as remnants of the early Indo-European peoples who had migrated out of the Caucasus. From their homeland in Central Europe they began to expand and migrate in response to the weakening of the Roman Empire. (You\\'ll remember this from previous episodes as the Great Migration Period.) The Poles loved their new home, which they shared with Germanic tribes from Scandinavia and the occasional Asian nomadic raiders. The Slavs of Poland were organized into smaller tribes living in and around the Baltic Sea and the Vistula river delta. They united under Poland\\'s first official leader, Mieszko. Mieszko was the duke of the Polans This was a good gig to have since the tribe eventually became the name of the whole country: Poland. Mieszko was a member of the noble house of Piast; his dynasty would rule Poland for centuries. With his baptism in 966 A.D., the country slowly abandoned traditional Slavic paganism and adopted western Christianity. Mieszko\\'s son Bolesław the Brave expanded the territory south into what he hoped would be a strong regional power, but, alas, it was a bit too early for that still. He established the metropolitan see at Gniezno, forming the headquarters of what would become the Catholic Church in Poland. His consolidation of power led him to be crowned Poland\\'s first official king, and then he died, all in the same year. (Which is great.) The Piast dynasty was somewhat up and down and internal conflicts often plagued the royal court. Till this guy, Casimir the Restorer, restored the monarchy\\'s control, which, come to think of it, is probably why they called him \"the Restorer\"? He modernized Poland into a feudalistic society, which came with all these cool things like knights and lords and castles. This helped to secure the borders, which up until now had changed depending on who was king. The early kingdom, somewhat weaker than his neighbours and strapped for cash, did however hold the Mongol invasion into Europe, having been sacked twice before. Notable of this time was the Polish relationship with the Germans, whose dukes and lords had come to possess large amounts of the west, and the Teutonic Knights, who had carved out a significant state for themselves in Livonia and Prussia, a land inhabited by Pagans, frequently raided by crusaders. By the time Piast rule ended with Casimir the Great, Poland had lost much of its territory to its neighbours. But, with a period of peace, the state soon began to prosper and attract Jewish settlement. The counties in this area became a source of contention between the kings of Poland and the Holy Roman Empire. Who fought over the local lords for fealty and allegiance. This resulted in these counties being very mixed, with populations of people from both kingdoms; the whole thing was very unbohemian, really. The Jews first settled in Poland as merchants on popular trade routes. By this century the Jewish people had settled in great numbers over many kingdoms in Europe and began their long and very sad history. They were expelled by the masses in all the countries they settled in and were often victims of massacres, and worse, crusades. Successive expulsions led the population in Poland to swell, which was a comparatively more tolerant society, which became a centre of Judaic learning and culture as the centuries continued. However, things weren\\'t always super peachy and anti-Jewish riots often erupted in Polish towns, and synagogues were frequently burned. King Casimir the Great, dying without an heir, left his kingdom to his nephew Lewis, the king of Hungary. Lewis left his now three kingdoms to his daughters, one of whom died unexpectedly, the other, who was supposed to inherit Poland but inherited Hungary instead, and the last one, Jadwiga, who got Poland. The nobles of Poland welcomed Louis\\'s daughter and crowned her king... Yes, king, not queen. Don\\'t ask. Jadwiga\\'s life would not be unlike a medieval television drama as she was simultaneously engaged to both a grand duke of Lithuania Jogaila, whose Kingdom was huge and powerful, and the Habsburg duke of Austria, who was inbred... and fat. I think she made the right choice. The union of Jadwiga and Władysław formed the Polish-Lithuanian union, which is now the largest country in Europe under a single monarchy. The Lithuanians had become a strong military power in the previous century,  capturing large amounts of Russian and Mongol land. The now combined countries spread from the Baltic to the Black Sea. The Lithuanians, with their far smaller population, never ventured too far from their castles--why would you?--and preferred to rule Ruthenia from Livonia instead. So by the time of the Union, the much larger Polish population came to dominate the Ruthenian lands, spreading their language and their culture, and eventually dwarfing their Livonian allies. The Teutonic Order, that German state on the Baltic, had become somewhat of a bad neighbour, leading raids, crusades, and plundering castles, or otherwise stumbling drunk into Polish-Lithuanian territory, starting fires and whatnot. The union of the two states proved beneficial, handing the Knights a crushing defeat of the Battle of Grunwald in 1410; they also fought numerous wars with the Muscovites, Tatars, and Ottomans. Noteworthy of the galleon period was the efficiency of the feudal system and the pseudo democratic nature of the parliament, who set up sophisticated bureaucracy for king approval (or disapproval, if you are unlucky). Within just a few decades, the Teutonic Order had completely lost their state, with the western half being annexed directly into Poland and the rest becoming a fief to the Polish Crown. This gave access of Poland to the prosperous Baltic seaports and an explosion in trade (keep your eye on this it becomes important later). The Prussian fief would later be inherited by Duke from Brandenburg estate within the Holy Roman Empire. A trend which would become ever more troublesome as lords within the HRE would increasingly inherit lands outside the imperial borders. The HRE was weird. Don\\'t worry about it. :D Acquiring Danzig, or Gdańsk, had huge economic benefits and cities swelled in size in response to the trade boom, like Poznań, Lwów and the capital Kraków, and most notably Warsaw. Warsaw, or Warszawa in Polish, was up to this point just a small fishing village. Legend has it that a fisherman named Wars happened upon a mermaid in the Vistula river named Sawa. The two married and founded the town of Warszawa. The Poles, like most Europeans, were often embroiled in wars and this made famous their heavy cavalry, the Winged Hussars (which I\\'m sure I\\'ll mobbed and lynched if I don\\'t talk about...). Initially a contingent of Hungarian mercenaries the Hussars soon became an elite shock cavalry so powerful they allowed the Poles to win many otherwise hopeless battles. The Hussars became the envy of Europe, the most powerful and disciplined heavy cavalry the Middle Ages had ever known and are still a matter of intense national symbolism of Poland. The sixteenth century was a really big one and included the protestant reformation affecting mostly German parts of the Kingdom, wars against the encroaching Ottomans invading Europe, advances in science and literature, with Copernicus devising the heliocentric model of the Solar System, the nationwide codification of the Polish language, and the biggest one, the changing of the Polish-Lithuanian union into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth: a single political entity ratified by the Polish parliament, or Sejm, with elected rather than hereditary kings The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, or just Poland for short, became a centre of power and commerce and a bulwark against invading Turks, who had become a larger and larger problem for the European powers since their humble beginnings in Central Asia. During the Polish-Muscovite war, the Poles became involved in the Russian succession crisis, or the Time of Troubles, and began flexing their muscles with their famous hussars. They even occupied Moscow for a short period but were soon driven out, because invading Russia is simply impossible, unless you are the Mongols. The series of Northern Wars and the Russo-Polish war left the Commonwealth in a very precarious and weakened state. This was aggravated by the election of Polish kings, which opened the door for other nations to meddle in Polish affairs. Which they did, a lot. During the wars the Commonwealth lost the territory of Livonia and was devastated by the so-called Swedish Deluge, leaving much of the nation in ruins. Poland became weakened during the Great Northern War against Sweden and during the War of the Polish Succession, it became increasingly clear that Poland\\'s fate was going to be decided by its neighbors. The Polish parliament became ineffective due to complicated veto laws which made passing reforms or mounting resistance to invasion nothing if not impossible. The political limbo and the sheer size of the Commonwealth started to make cutting pieces out of it looked pretty attractive The last king of Poland, Stanislav II, was elected in 1764 as a puppet of the Russian Empire, aided greatly by the fact that he was in bed with Catherine the Great. Stanislav did attempt reform to try and save face but was aware the kingdom was on its last breath. Before long the First Partition of Poland was enacted, dividing the outlying provinces between Austria, Prussia, and Russia. In dire straits, the parliament was powerless to stop the invading troops and forced to ratify the new borders. The Great Sejm tried once more to reform by drafting a formal constitution inspired by the liberties of the French revolution, but it was enough to provoke Russia again, who saw France as an enemy and Poland as a sympathizer to anti-monarchic sentiments. Pro- and anti-constitutional forces became embroiled in a war and Russian forces invaded to broker a defeat to the republican movement. With an agreement signed with Prussia, the two nations annexed more territory in the Second Partition, reducing Poland to one-third its size and population. The king was horrifically unpopular, the army was in shambles, the parliament was divided and powerless. The common people were furious and insurrections led to the national rebellion led by the military veteran Tadeusz Kościuszko. After an initial success, the rebels failed to garner support from many other nations and were defeated by the surrounding powers. In 1795, the Austrians, Prussians and Russians decided to put an end to the rebellious Poles and invaded them from three sides. The Third Partition of Poland, as it became known, wiped Poland off the face of the map for the next century. Millions of Poles now found themselves subject to whichever nation they were divided into, isolated from one another; and Poland ceased to exist. Now as you all know if you\\'ve ever picked up a map Poland did indeed return as a sovereign nation. But we will have to get to all of that in part two.

       " \"and welcome back everybody it's sicaru here uh\\xa0\\ndoing an exclusive video for youtube normally\\xa0\\xa0 of course i do a lot of streams on twitch we\\xa0\\nput them on youtube but based on the fact that\\xa0\\xa0 i am stuck here in poland i have not had great\\xa0\\ninternet throughout my time i thought why not\\xa0\\xa0 do an opening video for youtube all right so\\xa0\\nso rather fittingly since i am in poland the\\xa0\\xa0 video we're going to do and do an opening on is\\xa0\\nthe polish opening all right so without further\\xa0\\xa0 ado i will give you some background on this now\\xa0\\nthe polish opening starts with the move 1b4 here\\xa0\\xa0 now the idea behind b4 is multi multi-purpose\\xa0\\nfirst of all white wants to create more space\\xa0\\xa0 than you would ordinarily with a move like b3\\xa0\\nhere b3 is a move as well to go bishop to b2 um\\xa0\\xa0 but with b4 you potentially take more space in\\xa0\\nthe center black not play for c5 d5 and so forth\\xa0\\xa0 now b4 has been a move that has been\\xa0\\naround for a very very long time\\xa0\\xa0 however it came back to prominence recently when\\xa0\\nmagnus carlson the world chess champion started\\xa0\\xa0 playing it during the meltwater chess champions\\xa0\\ntour in 2021 therefore the first game we're going\\xa0\\xa0 to look at is a game that i played with the black\\xa0\\npieces against magnus during during the champions\\xa0\\xa0 chess tour ftx crypto cup knockout all right so\\xa0\\nb4 is played by magnus i play e5 here bishop to\\xa0\\xa0 b2 play bishop takes b4 now one thing to note is\\xa0\\neven though i play this game with the black pieces\\xa0\\xa0 we are going to be looking at this from the white\\xa0\\nfrom the white side for the most part so bishop\\xa0\\xa0 takes b4 bishop takes e5 is played here now again\\xa0\\nblack has many options here for example black and\\xa0\\xa0 play move like d6 maybe knight c6 or even queen\\xa0\\ne7 here but one big difference of course is\\xa0\\xa0 that with the pawn being on b4 versus say let's\\xa0\\nlet's just say b3 for example as a um as a move\\xa0\\xa0 let's say white goes wait actually apparently i\\xa0\\nhaven't figured this out um as far as why i can't\\xa0\\xa0 make uh make analysis anyway after bishop b2 if\\xa0\\nblack plays knight c6 here white can now play b5\\xa0\\xa0 which attacks knight on c6 whereas at the pawn\\xa0\\nwe're on b3 here it could not go forward to b5\\xa0\\xa0 so bishop b2 bishop takes before his play now\\xa0\\nthis is considered the most principled approach\\xa0\\xa0 and after bishop takes e5 knight f6 is played\\xa0\\nnow ordinarily it looks like if you if you go\\xa0\\xa0 according to the basic rules giving up a pawn\\xa0\\non the side of the board for pawn in the center\\xa0\\xa0 should be favorable for white because having\\xa0\\nthe pawns in the center is more important than\\xa0\\xa0 pawns on the edge of the board however in this\\xa0\\nsituation black can play for quick development\\xa0\\xa0 and black can also try to stop white from playing\\xa0\\nd4 and c4 later on so c3 is played here by magnus\\xa0\\xa0 i play bishop to e7 and now magnus plays move pawn\\xa0\\nto e3 now this is a very unusual setup but as i\\xa0\\xa0 said before white would really like to take the\\xa0\\ncenter here but it's very hard to get the pawns\\xa0\\xa0 on e4 and d4 of course you play e4 here at some\\xa0\\npoint black and castle and let's say you play\\xa0\\xa0 something like d3 after black plays a move like d5\\xa0\\nhere this is very very bad for white the center is\\xa0\\xa0 collapsing immediately additionally you'll notice\\xa0\\nthat here black has already castled the king out\\xa0\\xa0 of the center of the board and white still has not\\xa0\\ndeveloped these three pieces the bishop the knight\\xa0\\xa0 and the rook on the king side so this would be\\xa0\\nvery bad for white so therefore after bishop 7\\xa0\\xa0 how do you try to take the center so the way that\\xa0\\nyou usually try to take the center is to play for\\xa0\\xa0 d4 and c4 as i alluded to earlier now again you\\xa0\\ndo want to develop this bishop and there are\\xa0\\xa0 two ways to do it you can play e3 and something\\xa0\\nlike bishop d3 or you can play something like g3\\xa0\\xa0 and bishop g2 now again we have many games to go\\xa0\\nthrough so we will see various different setups\\xa0\\xa0 i will add as well in future games we will see\\xa0\\nthe lines with bishop a5 which i do believe\\xa0\\xa0 is a little bit more precise anyway bishop e7 e3\\xa0\\nis played by magnus i play c5 here trying to stop\\xa0\\xa0 white from playing playing for development in the\\xa0\\ncenter immediately so here magnus plays the move\\xa0\\xa0 bishop takes f6 now this is a very strange\\xa0\\nchoice by magnus definitely not a move that\\xa0\\xa0 i would expect out of him but again we're sort\\xa0\\nof in unknown territory already and magus is a\\xa0\\xa0 straightforward concept of taking and playing\\xa0\\ng3 and fianchettoing his light square bishop\\xa0\\xa0 what you will notice however that's particularly\\xa0\\nstrange is that white has played the movie e3 if\\xa0\\xa0 white would like to play g3 it would make a little\\xa0\\nbit more sense potentially to play g3 let's just\\xa0\\xa0 say d5 bishop takes f6 push takes off bishop g2\\xa0\\nfollowed by knight f3 without wasting a tempo on\\xa0\\xa0 pop on the move pawn to e3 so after e3 c5 i play\\xa0\\nfish takes f6 bishop f6 g3 played by magnus now\\xa0\\xa0 i go b6 the idea is that here because white has\\xa0\\npushed the pawn to e3 i now want to play bishop\\xa0\\xa0 a6 and prevent the white king from castling out of\\xa0\\nthe middle of the board so bishop g2 is played i\\xa0\\xa0 play knight c6 of course not d5 here if i play d5\\xa0\\ni'm a little bit worried that white might be able\\xa0\\xa0 to play knight to e2 here followed by knight f4\\xa0\\nand putting a lot of pressure on the pawn on d5\\xa0\\xa0 so therefore after bishop g2 i play the move\\xa0\\nknight to c6 d4 is played by magnus again now\\xa0\\xa0 it makes some sense as to why he played e3 upon\\xa0\\ne3 supports a pawn push in the center of the fort\\xa0\\xa0 so now i go bishop to a6 magnus plays knight e2\\xa0\\nof course not knight to f3 because now white will\\xa0\\xa0 never be able to cast the king out of the center\\xa0\\nof the board so 92 is played now here i castle\\xa0\\xa0 magnus castles and now i go rook e8 now again\\xa0\\nit would have been nice if i could have looked\\xa0\\xa0 for a tactic here i remember during the game i\\xa0\\nthought there might be some idea like pawn takes\\xa0\\xa0 pawn pawn takes and something like bishop takes\\xa0\\ne2 queen e2 knight takes d4 but unfortunately here\\xa0\\xa0 it doesn't quite work because after pawn takes\\xa0\\nknight bishop takes pawn white can simply take\\xa0\\xa0 the rook on a and after i take back on a8 white\\xa0\\nmoves the knight to d2 and after bishop takes a1\\xa0\\xa0 brook takes the a1 white simply has an extra\\xa0\\nknight here and he's completely winning\\xa0\\xa0 so after castles i play the move work\\xa0\\nto e8 so after rook to e8 is played here\\xa0\\xa0 magnus now blunders he plays the move rook to e1\\xa0\\nalready it's a little bit tricky here in terms of\\xa0\\xa0 how to how to play this position perhaps white\\xa0\\ncan play something simpler like knight to d2\\xa0\\xa0 and after pawn takes d4 here y can take and after\\xa0\\nbishop takes queen takes now after the move knight\\xa0\\xa0 takes d4 which looks very flashy winning a pawn\\xa0\\nbecause of the pin white cannot capture back she\\xa0\\xa0 would take the queen white can very simply\\xa0\\nplay a move like queen to g4 and he's still\\xa0\\xa0 attacking the rook on eight and after knight\\xa0\\nto c6 here why you can play rookie d1 and even\\xa0\\xa0 though white is down a pawn here there's a lot\\xa0\\nof pressure on the center of the board there's\\xa0\\xa0 pressure towards the pawn on d7 white can also\\xa0\\nplay knight e4 and additionally this bishop on g2\\xa0\\xa0 also has a lot of great squares in here in the\\xa0\\ncenter of the board and there's also even 94\\xa0\\xa0 96 potentially so there's a lot of play for\\xa0\\nwhite here even though white has one less pawn so\\xa0\\xa0 instead magnus plays rookie one i play rook to c8\\xa0\\nand now he plays 83 which if this weren't magnus\\xa0\\xa0 you would think it's a fatal blunder of course\\xa0\\nbeing magnus there's still a lot of resources\\xa0\\xa0 that exist in the position now what here in\\xa0\\nthis position it's already quite difficult\\xa0\\xa0 for white to play now you might wonder well why\\xa0\\nis it difficult what really changed after move\\xa0\\xa0 rook c8 and what change is that after white\\xa0\\nmoves let's just say white plays like h3 for\\xa0\\xa0 uh for an example you can now actually not\\xa0\\nnaturally let's say white plays with like knight\\xa0\\xa0 two for an example you can now take the pawn on\\xa0\\nd4 and after c takes d4 there's now knight to\\xa0\\xa0 b4 with the idea of knight c2 forking the rooks\\xa0\\non e1 and a1 there's also the idea of maybe even\\xa0\\xa0 knight d3 and now the knight on b4 the bishop\\xa0\\non a6 and the reconcile are all optimally placed\\xa0\\xa0 so magnus plays a3 here basically hoping for the\\xa0\\nidea that after takes takes let's say i take here\\xa0\\xa0 there's no knight before because the pawn prevents\\xa0\\nit however this is this is a mistake because after\\xa0\\xa0 a3 there's a tactic here so i go bishop takes\\xa0\\ne2 rook takes the e2 now i play pawn takes pawn\\xa0\\xa0 magnus takes back and now i have the move knight\\xa0\\ntakes d4 now here you'll notice that the rook is\\xa0\\xa0 no longer on a either so there are no longer ideas\\xa0\\nwhere white can capture and therefore the tactic\\xa0\\xa0 works here so knight d4 pawn takes knight we\\xa0\\ntrade on e2 i take on d4 and the problem for white\\xa0\\xa0 here is very simple in this position the rook is\\xa0\\nunder attack there are no squares on this this uh\\xa0\\xa0 back rank because the knight is in the way so you\\xa0\\ncan't bring the rook to the center of the board\\xa0\\xa0 as you move the rook to a2 here which happens in\\xa0\\nthe game of course now i play the move work to\\xa0\\xa0 c1 check attacking the king and the knight\\xa0\\nat the same time so magnus plays bishop f1\\xa0\\xa0 i take the knight and now magnus being magnus\\xa0\\nyou would think well it's two pawns black has\\xa0\\xa0 six pawns here same same material on the board\\xa0\\nmore or less it blacks up two pawns looks really\\xa0\\xa0 really good but magnus being magnus finds the\\xa0\\ncorrect way to define the position with queen d3\\xa0\\xa0 so in this position with the bishop on d4 and\\xa0\\nthe rook on b1 under attack i really only have\\xa0\\xa0 two ways to try and save material if i were to\\xa0\\nsay move the rook to c1 or work to e1 for example\\xa0\\xa0 both moves would simply allow white to capture the\\xa0\\nbishop on d4 here so i can't really play for play\\xa0\\xa0 for either of these options so instead i play the\\xa0\\nmove rook to b2 now rook a1 is also possible but\\xa0\\xa0 after rook a1 bishop a1 queen to d6 here i felt\\xa0\\nthat the bishop on a1 is completely out of play\\xa0\\xa0 here and it's not really doing a whole lot it's on\\xa0\\nthis diagonal but it's not doing anything else so\\xa0\\xa0 instead i play rook to b2 because now afterward\\xa0\\ntakes b2 bishop takes b2 the bishop is attacking\\xa0\\xa0 the pawn on a3 still however here magnus plays\\xa0\\nqueen to d6 and after i play the move pawn to g6\\xa0\\xa0 magnus plays move pawn to e4 very good move here\\xa0\\neven though black is down too even though sorry\\xa0\\xa0 even though white is down two pawns here you'll\\xa0\\nnotice that black has problems because the pawn\\xa0\\xa0 on d7 is still very weak and additionally this\\xa0\\npawn on a4 is now on a white square as well so\\xa0\\xa0 white has a very simple idea of going bishop b5 to\\xa0\\ncapture the pawn on d7 here so i play queen to e8\\xa0\\xa0 magnus goes queen to d2 attacking the bishop on\\xa0\\nb2 additionally there is one difference if white\\xa0\\xa0 were to play bishop to b5 here potentially\\xa0\\nthere might be some tricks with queen e1\\xa0\\xa0 king g2 and queen to e4 followed by some bishop\\xa0\\nd4 so by playing queen to d2 here first magnus\\xa0\\xa0 attacks the bishop on b2b also covers the e1\\xa0\\nsquare against a potential queen to e1 check\\xa0\\xa0 so here i play bishop a3 magnus plays bishop to b5\\xa0\\nnow i go bishop to c5 magnus plays bishop takes d7\\xa0\\xa0 and now here i play queen to e4 now again this is\\xa0\\nan opening opening video so i'm not going to go\\xa0\\xa0 through the entire game i will note that black is\\xa0\\nup one one pawn here very centralized queen on e4\\xa0\\xa0 great bishop on c5 however with correct play due\\xa0\\nto the opposite colored bishops white should be\\xa0\\xa0 able to survive this and indeed magnus played more\\xa0\\nor less flawlessly to survive the game and make a\\xa0\\xa0 draw here so this is the first game that i want\\xa0\\nto go over so let's move on to the next game now\\xa0\\xa0 so the next game is a game that i played against\\xa0\\npeter savidler in our very recent matchup in the\\xa0\\xa0 speedchest championship which i would go on to win\\xa0\\nso again as as we start out as always b4 is played\\xa0\\xa0 peter plays e5 bishop b2 bishop takes b4 bishop\\xa0\\ntakes e5 knight to f6 c3 is played by me with the\\xa0\\xa0 white pieces here and now peter plays bishop to\\xa0\\na5 here now as i alluded to during the first game\\xa0\\xa0 this is objectively the most challenging approach\\xa0\\nprimarily because black is a very simple idea here\\xa0\\xa0 black wants to go d5 c5 and d4 and take advantage\\xa0\\nof this pin from a5 to e1 so here i play g3 peter\\xa0\\xa0 plays c6 and now i play bishop g2 looks very\\xa0\\nsimilar to the first game with the exception being\\xa0\\xa0 the bishop is on a5 versus being on seven so peter\\xa0\\ncastle's here now i play e3 same idea of playing\\xa0\\xa0 knight to e2 and castles again the way that i want\\xa0\\nto take the center is later on i want to play d4\\xa0\\xa0 and c4 if i get a perfect world scenario i'll just\\xa0\\nset it up for you guys so you see it bishop b6 d4\\xa0\\xa0 let's say d6 is played i take go 92 something\\xa0\\nlike 97 castles just a6 if white gets this\\xa0\\xa0 position with c4 followed by knight c3 white\\xa0\\nis doing very very well here and it's very very\\xa0\\xa0 pleasant so after e3 rook t8 is played by peter i\\xa0\\ntrade on f6 now i go knight to e2 peter plays d5\\xa0\\xa0 and now i castle now what you'll notice is that\\xa0\\neven though after 97 i get d4 and i'm not easily\\xa0\\xa0 getting in the c4 pawn push without getting\\xa0\\nthe c4 pawn pushing it could get really bad\\xa0\\xa0 in a hurry because first of all the bishop on g2\\xa0\\nis staring at a closed diagonal there are a bunch\\xa0\\xa0 of pawns in the way additionally if black can\\xa0\\nget knight b6 and bishop f5 blackwell ideas like\\xa0\\xa0 knight c4 bishop e4 and it could be very dangerous\\xa0\\nvery very quickly so peter plays knight b6 here\\xa0\\xa0 tries to put the knight on c4 or potentially play\\xa0\\nfor bishop f5 and bishop e4 so now i play knight\\xa0\\xa0 to d2 peter goes bishop g4 and now i play the move\\xa0\\nrook to c1 very important move here if i were to\\xa0\\xa0 play a move like let's say h3 black can simply\\xa0\\ntrade on e2 and win the pawn on c3 and if i were\\xa0\\xa0 to try something like pawn to f3 for example here\\xa0\\nthis is very sketchy because after f3 black can go\\xa0\\xa0 bishop to c8 and there's a very they're very weak\\xa0\\npawns here on e3 and c3 potentially computer of\\xa0\\xa0 course says that after knight p3 white's probably\\xa0\\nokay but it's very difficult to play for a human\\xa0\\xa0 so instead i play the move rook to c1\\xa0\\nvery logical move to guard the pawn on c3\\xa0\\xa0 so peter trades on e2 now this move i think is\\xa0\\njust a mistake that occurred in a blitz game\\xa0\\xa0 i think in a much slower game peter never would\\xa0\\nhave played a move like this computer in fact\\xa0\\xa0 thinks that after queen h6 here black is doing\\xa0\\nvery well because you prevent h3 and it's really\\xa0\\xa0 a question of how white will ever break this pin\\xa0\\nand of course now f3 is not possible whatsoever\\xa0\\xa0 because queen takes e3 would be checked so after\\xa0\\nqueen h6 is very hard for white to play however\\xa0\\xa0 again this was a blitz game and peter instead\\xa0\\ntook on e2 which is a big mistake because as\\xa0\\xa0 i've alluded to before one of the biggest points\\xa0\\nbehind playing this polish opening where you give\\xa0\\xa0 a pawn on the side for a pawn on the center is\\xa0\\nthat white wants to show that the pawns in the\\xa0\\xa0 center and the center center pawn pushes are more\\xa0\\nimportant than pawns on the edge of the board very\\xa0\\xa0 specifically a7 and v7 so it's a big mistake by\\xa0\\npeter to trade so he trades he goes knight a4\\xa0\\xa0 and now i go c4 now i suspect during the game\\xa0\\npeter probably saw one of a cup saw a couple ideas\\xa0\\xa0 here first of all i think he probably thought\\xa0\\nmaybe there was queen takes d4 because now if i\\xa0\\xa0 take the queen black can simply capture the queen\\xa0\\non e2 and if i play a move like knight to b3 here\\xa0\\xa0 black can go queen to b6 guarding the bishop on\\xa0\\na5 but now white very simply takes the pawn on d5\\xa0\\xa0 and after pawn takes bishop takes white has a\\xa0\\ngreat wooden shield in the center of the board\\xa0\\xa0 here with the bishop on d5 additionally the knight\\xa0\\non a4 and the bishop on a5 are both on the rim\\xa0\\xa0 and it's really really hard to play for black so\\xa0\\nafter c4 peter plays knight to c3 so now i play\\xa0\\xa0 queen to d3 computer plays knight takes a2 and now\\xa0\\ni go rook to a1 attacking both the knight on a2\\xa0\\xa0 and potentially the bishop on 85. now black here\\xa0\\nwere to say trade the bishop for the knight on d2\\xa0\\xa0 after queen takes d2 the knight on a2 is simply\\xa0\\nstuck here and it's completely winning for white\\xa0\\xa0 so after knight b4 is played i play queen to b1\\xa0\\nhere peter plays pawn to b6 and now i go knight\\xa0\\xa0 to b3 so here peter plays queen to d8 trying\\xa0\\nto save at least materially everything on the\\xa0\\xa0 board here now he could have maybe taken on c4\\xa0\\nbut after knight a5 b takes a5 brook takes a5\\xa0\\xa0 even though black is temporarily up a pawn after\\xa0\\na move like rook a b8 here i can play queen c1\\xa0\\xa0 and all these pawns upon those c6 and c4 and the\\xa0\\npawn on a7 are very very weak here and long term\\xa0\\xa0 for those who play the catalan they should\\xa0\\nnotice the structure it's going to be really\\xa0\\xa0 really difficult to defend so instead peter plays\\xa0\\nthe move queen to d8 so of course i take on a5\\xa0\\xa0 he takes back now i take on d5 he takes back and\\xa0\\nblack is temporarily up a pawn here but once again\\xa0\\xa0 black has three pawns that are very weak the pawns\\xa0\\non a5 and a7 are very weak they're double pawns\\xa0\\xa0 pawn on d5 is also very very weak and it's gonna\\xa0\\nhave to be protected for the rest of the game\\xa0\\xa0 so here i go queen to b3 develop the queen put\\xa0\\nmore pressure on d5 additionally i have an idea\\xa0\\xa0 like queen e4 and queen takes a5 as well\\xa0\\nso g6 is played here now i go queen to a4\\xa0\\xa0 peter plays rook to e6 and now i play queen takes\\xa0\\na5 and already at this point even though material\\xa0\\xa0 is equal white should be much better if not\\xa0\\ntechnically winning due to the very weak pawns\\xa0\\xa0 on d5 and a7 so peter plays rook b6 i go rook\\xa0\\nc1 trying to take the open file again perfect\\xa0\\xa0 perfect placement of the brooks and the queen\\xa0\\nthere's a lot of pressure towards the pawn on a7\\xa0\\xa0 the pawn on d5 as well and now the rook on c1 can\\xa0\\ncome to c5 later on so after rook fc1 peter plays\\xa0\\xa0 queen d7 a fatal blunder now again as i said it's\\xa0\\nalready very difficult to play for black maybe\\xa0\\xa0 something like a6 gives him some hope but still\\xa0\\nafter move like rook c5 very very tough position\\xa0\\xa0 for black to play here so instead he plays queen\\xa0\\nd7 so i take on b6 and after pawn takes queen i\\xa0\\xa0 play rook takes a8 king g7 and now i play rook\\xa0\\nto a3 and here peter resigned in view of the\\xa0\\xa0 fact that he still has the weak pawn on d5 white\\xa0\\nthe white king is very very safe here all these\\xa0\\xa0 pawns and this bishop around it and additionally\\xa0\\ni have ideas like rook b3 to win the pawn on b6\\xa0\\xa0 so therefore peter resigned here and i think this\\xa0\\nis a very illustrative game about why black has\\xa0\\xa0 to be very clear on what the ideas are um in the\\xa0\\nmiddle game in terms of white trying to play for\\xa0\\xa0 the c4 pawn break alright so let's move on\\xa0\\nto the next game so next game that we have\\xa0\\xa0 the next the next game that we have is a game\\xa0\\nthat i played against the player valerie greenup\\xa0\\xa0 entitled tuesday so same opening again\\xa0\\nas i said this is an opening video b4 e5\\xa0\\xa0 bishop b2 bishop takes b4 bishop e5 knight f6 so\\xa0\\nhere i played e3 and now green up plays for d5\\xa0\\xa0 d5 right away so i play c3 bishop d6 now this is\\xa0\\nnot quite the best move um in this position as\\xa0\\xa0 i said bishop a5 is always a little bit better\\xa0\\nbut we've now seen three different setups we've\\xa0\\xa0 seen bishop a5 bishop e7 and now bishop d6 so\\xa0\\nnow after bishop d6 i trade i go g3 same setup\\xa0\\xa0 again castles bishop g2 attacks the pawn on d5 c6\\xa0\\nis played play knight to e2 bishop g4 is played\\xa0\\xa0 now i go d4 again very similar knight d7\\xa0\\nknight to d2 and black plays queen e7 now here\\xa0\\xa0 as i said before one of the reasons you really\\xa0\\nneed to be aware of what you're playing for in\\xa0\\xa0 these positions is because queen e7 is already\\xa0\\nsort of going the wrong direction black has the\\xa0\\xa0 idea of playing knight f6 potentially and trying\\xa0\\nto play in the center whereas the knight really\\xa0\\xa0 belongs on b6 trying to go towards c4 so i castle\\xa0\\nhere knight f6 is played and now i play rookie one\\xa0\\xa0 now the computer says that i actually could have\\xa0\\ngotten away with pawn pawn to c4 here but in a\\xa0\\xa0 blitz game a little bit unsure i thought it was a\\xa0\\nlittle bit better to be pragmatic guard the knight\\xa0\\xa0 on e2 so that i can break the pin with a queen\\xa0\\nmove on the next turn and additionally maybe i can\\xa0\\xa0 play for c4 later on and the third point is that\\xa0\\nlater maybe i can even go f3 and e4 and try to\\xa0\\xa0 play in the center of the board so after rook to\\xa0\\ne1 granola plays b5 stopping this pawn push to c4\\xa0\\xa0 i go pawn to a4 a6 is played and now i play queen\\xa0\\nto c2 here and now green up kind of loses really\\xa0\\xa0 loses the threat of the game he plays the move\\xa0\\nbishop to h5 looks like a very logical move idea\\xa0\\xa0 to go bishop g6 prevent e4 and also put pressure\\xa0\\ntowards the queen on c2 so it looks like a very\\xa0\\xa0 very logical very human move here so now i play\\xa0\\nthe move knight to f4 which attacks the bishop\\xa0\\xa0 on h5 also at bishop g6 i will capture it and the\\xa0\\nlast point is black takes on f4 here after i take\\xa0\\xa0 back with the pawn let's just say black was queen\\xa0\\nd6 to illustrate the point after h3 blacks bishop\\xa0\\xa0 is actually getting trapped here by g4 and f5\\xa0\\nso say black goes bishop g6 i play pawn to f5\\xa0\\xa0 queen guards the pawn and after bishop h5\\xa0\\ni can simply go g4 trapping the bishop on\\xa0\\xa0 h5 and black really has no way to save the\\xa0\\nbishop say you play a move like knight to d7\\xa0\\xa0 same problem i go g4 bishop g6 f5 trapping the\\xa0\\nbishop on g6 here no squares for that bishop\\xa0\\xa0 so after knight f4 bishop g6 is played by grena\\xa0\\nso now i take on g6 pawn takes knight and now\\xa0\\xa0 i change up and i play f3 again you'll notice in\\xa0\\nthis position black has a really strong grip here\\xa0\\xa0 on the c4 square i can't really open up\\xa0\\nthis diagonal from g2 to a8 via c4 because\\xa0\\xa0 of the over protection the black has from the\\xa0\\npawns on the queen side so instead i now go to\\xa0\\xa0 plan b which is now i play f3 to try and open up\\xa0\\nthe center this way with a pawn push to e4 and\\xa0\\xa0 you'll also notice that now with the rook on e1\\xa0\\nit makes perfect sense in terms of why i played\\xa0\\xa0 this move earlier again i'd like to say that i had\\xa0\\nthis plan during the game but it just so happens\\xa0\\xa0 that i put the pieces on the right squares so\\xa0\\nafter f3 c5 is played so now i go pawn to e4\\xa0\\xa0 green f trades on e4 i take back with pawn of\\xa0\\ncourse pawn takes pawn takes and now i reach a\\xa0\\xa0 classic position where i pawns on e4 and d4 versus\\xa0\\nthe pawns on a6 and b5 so here bishop b4 is played\\xa0\\xa0 play pawn to e5 discovered attack on the rook and\\xa0\\nthe knight at the same time grant plays rook ac8\\xa0\\xa0 here and now i play queen d3 important that i do\\xa0\\nnot take the knight right off it looks like well\\xa0\\xa0 if i take rook takes queen pawn takes queen this\\xa0\\nshould just be winning for white whites up a piece\\xa0\\xa0 here but if i take on f6 black it's a very nasty\\xa0\\nmove queen takes e1 and after rook takes e1 rook\\xa0\\xa0 takes c2 black is simply winning here because he\\xa0\\nhas an extra rook for a bishop or for a knight\\xa0\\xa0 and there's a pin so i'm going to lose either\\xa0\\nthe knight on d2 or the rook on e1 here\\xa0\\xa0 so after rookie c8 i play the move queen to d3\\xa0\\nsabrina plays knight d7 i trade on b5 and now i\\xa0\\xa0 play rookie d1 and i don't feel it's necessary\\xa0\\nreally to go through the rest of the game in\\xa0\\xa0 depth here but you will notice that at this point\\xa0\\nwhite is quite a bit better white has these nice\\xa0\\xa0 pawns in the center there's big weakness on b5\\xa0\\nand additionally black struggles to develop so\\xa0\\xa0 just to show a few more moves black takes on d2 i\\xa0\\ntake back with the rook still attacking the pawn\\xa0\\xa0 plays queen b4 and after rook to b1 queen c4\\xa0\\ni play the very nice move bishop h3 i do not\\xa0\\xa0 grab the pawn right away i put pressure on the\\xa0\\ndiagonal first and after queen takes rick takes\\xa0\\xa0 rook fd8 i play the move rook takes b5 and now\\xa0\\nwhite is simply up a pawn here the rook guards\\xa0\\xa0 upon e5 so there's no trick like this because rick\\xa0\\ntakes and white has one extra pawn here black has\\xa0\\xa0 double pawns and i would go on to win this game\\xa0\\nbut as i've said before this is an opening video\\xa0\\xa0 so i don't want to go through a 50 move plus game\\xa0\\num to show show and game technique all right so\\xa0\\xa0 let's move on to the next game so next game that\\xa0\\nwe're going to be looking at is the game that i\\xa0\\xa0 played against alexander moscalenko now this game\\xa0\\ni did something a little bit different now so far\\xa0\\xa0 in this polish opening after b4 e5 bishop b2 takes\\xa0\\ntakes knight f6 e3 castles c3 bishop a5 we've only\\xa0\\xa0 been looking at set of the g3 and bishop g2 now\\xa0\\ni think this game with bishop a5 illustrates why\\xa0\\xa0 the c5 d5 idea is so important so i play this\\xa0\\nmove bishop to d3 here again for a g3 you can\\xa0\\xa0 see the previous couple of games so bishop d3 d5\\xa0\\nwas played by mozcalenco this by the way was also\\xa0\\xa0 in a title tuesday event so i go bishop c2 idea is\\xa0\\npretty straightforward i just want to develop my\\xa0\\xa0 bishop this way maybe 92 maybe knight f3 followed\\xa0\\nby castles so knight pd7 is played by moscalenko\\xa0\\xa0 so now i go bishop to g3 here moscalenko plays\\xa0\\nrook to e8 and now i play knight e2 looks very\\xa0\\xa0 very pleasant i'm going to get castle play for\\xa0\\nd4 knight to c4 maybe even e4 later and most\\xa0\\xa0 importantly i keep the two bishops on the board\\xa0\\nunlike in the other variations where i was always\\xa0\\xa0 taking on f6 however moss lincoln to his credit\\xa0\\nplays us very well he plays c5 now here i play\\xa0\\xa0 bishop h4 now i'm not really sure why i played\\xa0\\nthis move in retrospect i think that during the\\xa0\\xa0 game the reason i didn't castle here was because\\xa0\\ni was worried there might be something like 94\\xa0\\xa0 and i might lose the bishop on g3 so i played\\xa0\\nbishop h4 he plays knight to e5 and now i castle\\xa0\\xa0 and now he plays knight g6 very very good move\\xa0\\nattacking the bishop on h4 trying to break the pin\\xa0\\xa0 from the vishwan h4 towards the queen on d8 so i\\xa0\\ngo bishop g3 and now he plays 94 great move again\\xa0\\xa0 taking space in the center now if i were to trade\\xa0\\nthe bishop for the night here it's important to\\xa0\\xa0 note that black takes with a pawn and now i have\\xa0\\nthis very ugly pawn structure with this backwards\\xa0\\xa0 pawn on d2 which can no longer go forward and\\xa0\\nblack is technically close to winning because he\\xa0\\xa0 can go bishop e6 and bishop c4 and i lack a lot of\\xa0\\ndevelopment and i have this very weak pawn on d2\\xa0\\xa0 so instead i play f3 so moscolanco takes so i take\\xa0\\nback with the pawn not the knight here because now\\xa0\\xa0 black can actually play d4 and you'll notice that\\xa0\\ni have big problems here i'm struggling to develop\\xa0\\xa0 the knight on d1 and the rook on a1 are not well\\xa0\\nplaced i can't really get them into the game\\xa0\\xa0 so it's really really bad for white so i take\\xa0\\nwith the h pawn which which is also not very\\xa0\\xa0 good but at least here black doesn't have d4\\xa0\\nimmediately so now moscolenko plays bishop b6\\xa0\\xa0 here preparing to play the pawn push to d4 now\\xa0\\nhere i would love to go pawn to d4 to prevent\\xa0\\xa0 that pawn push but i would end up hanging the pawn\\xa0\\non e3 here so instead i play knight to eight three\\xa0\\xa0 and moscow i go plays d4 crack plate now i go\\xa0\\nbishop a4 trying to dodge this fork with d3 say\\xa0\\xa0 i go knight c4 for example just d3 and now the\\xa0\\nbishop of the knight of fork so i go bishop a4\\xa0\\xa0 moscalenko plays rook to e7 here and now i play\\xa0\\nknight to c4 and now moscolanco trades on e3\\xa0\\xa0 creates the weak pawn on his e3 square and\\xa0\\nhe goes bishop e6 attacking the knight on c4\\xa0\\xa0 so here if i were to say take the bishop on\\xa0\\nb6 after queen b6 it doesn't look that bad\\xa0\\xa0 for white but in reality it's really problematic\\xa0\\ni have two pawn islands here on e2 and c3 these\\xa0\\xa0 two pawns are very weak additionally the bishop\\xa0\\non a4 is not well placed and i have to deal with\\xa0\\xa0 problems on the long diagonal from b6 towards\\xa0\\ng1 where black maybe can go c4 and the fourth\\xa0\\xa0 fourth and probably final problem is that black\\xa0\\ncan play rook d8 here and maybe even try to take\\xa0\\xa0 take control of the d file so here i play queen\\xa0\\ntakes c8 bishop takes d8 and now i go knight to d2\\xa0\\xa0 protecting the knight but after a6 king f2 b5\\xa0\\nattacking the bishop bishop c2 bishop to b6 black\\xa0\\xa0 is completely fine in fact i think black is better\\xa0\\nhere he's the two bishops he can start to mobilize\\xa0\\xa0 his pawns on the queen side i don't really have\\xa0\\na lot of play in the center of the board here\\xa0\\xa0 and so black should be clearly better now i would\\xa0\\ngo on to win this game due to some mistakes from\\xa0\\xa0 my opponent later on but out of the opening this\\xa0\\nis one example of why why at least in recent times\\xa0\\xa0 i've much preferred playing with polish opening\\xa0\\nwith this idea of g3 instead of trying to put\\xa0\\xa0 bishop on d3 or e2 here and so i hope this\\xa0\\ngame serves as a good illustrative example\\xa0\\xa0 all right so the next game that we're\\xa0\\ngoing to be looking at is is a game um\\xa0\\xa0 is a game against this player arya stanbeck urazia\\xa0\\nthis is also from title tuesday as well in case\\xa0\\xa0 the names look a little bit unfamiliar so b4 e5\\xa0\\nthere should be two bishop takes b4 is played here\\xa0\\xa0 and now i take knight f6 so e3 castles c3\\xa0\\nbishop a5 and here again in this game this\\xa0\\xa0 this is one of the earlier games i played with the\\xa0\\npolish opening i played bishop to d3 angling for\\xa0\\xa0 the same setup with bishop c2 so d5 is played here\\xa0\\nnow i go bishop c2 and now knight c6 is played\\xa0\\xa0 now in the previous game we saw a great example of\\xa0\\nwhy the c5 pawn push trying to play d4 and stopway\\xa0\\xa0 from getting this sort of triangle in the center\\xa0\\nwas so important so in this game my opponent plays\\xa0\\xa0 knight c6 so now i go back he goes 97 play knight\\xa0\\ne2 and he goes c6 now i castle and he plays bishop\\xa0\\xa0 f5 position is relatively balanced here i wouldn't\\xa0\\nsay that either side is better but you'll notice\\xa0\\xa0 that black is not being very aggressive with\\xa0\\nthis pawn push towards c5 and trying to fight\\xa0\\xa0 for the center of the board so white will very\\xa0\\neasily be able to play something like d492\\xa0\\xa0 and develop quite straight in in a quite\\xa0\\nstraightforward manner so bishop h4 is what\\xa0\\xa0 i played here and now urazia takes knight g6 is\\xa0\\nmaybe better again blitz game hard to find the\\xa0\\xa0 absolute best moves he trades and goes knight\\xa0\\ng6 very natural idea to to try and remove the\\xa0\\xa0 pin towards the queen on d8 again very similar\\xa0\\ntheme to the previous game against moscolenko\\xa0\\xa0 so now i trade but here i can go d4 and what\\xa0\\nyou'll notice is that in this position white\\xa0\\xa0 has traded off the lights or i should say black\\xa0\\nhas traded off the light square bishops so now\\xa0\\xa0 it's going to be very easy for white to develop\\xa0\\nyou have knight v2 with c4 or pawn to e4 as well\\xa0\\xa0 so h5 is played by urazia and now i go knight to\\xa0\\nd2 bishop c7 the idea of course try to maybe line\\xa0\\xa0 up a battery try to attack on the king side\\xa0\\nmaybe h4 h3 as well so i go pawn to c4 pawn\\xa0\\xa0 takes pawn is played and now i play queen takes\\xa0\\npawn h4 is played by urazyab and now i play h3\\xa0\\xa0 and now he goes 97 i guess the idea again probably\\xa0\\ntrying to bring the knight back towards the center\\xa0\\xa0 maybe towards f5 and d6 but black doesn't really\\xa0\\nhave much play here other than this diagonal\\xa0\\xa0 where maybe he can create some checkmate patterns\\xa0\\nso now i play rook b1 he goes rook b8 again tries\\xa0\\xa0 to guard the pawn and now i go knight to c3\\xa0\\ngoes rook d8 and i play knight to f3 very\\xa0\\xa0 logical move maybe not the best move but i always\\xa0\\ntry to stop these threats with like queen d6 and\\xa0\\xa0 queen h2 checkmate here and now i can sort of\\xa0\\nfocus on either playing e4 and e5 in the center\\xa0\\xa0 or playing rook c1 and trying to play on the queen\\xa0\\nside gear as well so knight f5 is played here\\xa0\\xa0 i go pawn to a4 urzaya plays bishop to a5 and now\\xa0\\ni go knight to e4 plays queen g6 and i play knight\\xa0\\xa0 to e5 so again this bishop move didn't really\\xa0\\nserve much of a purpose other than creating\\xa0\\xa0 maybe a slight threat towards one of the knights\\xa0\\nbut you'll see that the knights are now jumping\\xa0\\xa0 in the center of the board and it's very very hard\\xa0\\nfor black to play so he plays queen h5 only move\\xa0\\xa0 really to still protect the pawn and f7 here\\xa0\\nand now i go knight c5 great placement of the\\xa0\\xa0 knight now i put a lot of pressure towards\\xa0\\nthe pawn on b7 if black say tries to push\\xa0\\xa0 the pawn to b6 here i can now play knight take\\xa0\\nc6 and everything is sort of hanging for black\\xa0\\xa0 so knight d6 is played logical move it actually\\xa0\\nguards both pawns here so i play queen a2 bishop\\xa0\\xa0 to c7 back and now i go queen c2 queen to h7\\xa0\\nwe trade the queens i go knight f3 attack the\\xa0\\xa0 pawn on h4 black and not go g5 to guard the\\xa0\\npawn on h4 because then i would take on g5\\xa0\\xa0 so bishop b6 rook c1 knight f5 guards upon h4\\xa0\\nand now i play the move knight to b3 very very\\xa0\\xa0 simple plan of playing a5 and a6 here so rookie 8\\xa0\\nis played stop the pawn push potentially actually\\xa0\\xa0 this could be a real threat here let's say black\\xa0\\nplays move like f6 i can now go a5 bishop c7 and\\xa0\\xa0 i can even maybe go e4 here to undermine\\xa0\\nthe knight on f5 and win the pawn on h4\\xa0\\xa0 so he plays rookie 8 to stop the pawn\\xa0\\npush to e4 i go a5 bishop to c7 i play a6\\xa0\\xa0 undermining the pawn chain here uh b7 and c6 he\\xa0\\ntakes on a6 i play rook takes c6 bishop b6 and\\xa0\\xa0 now i go rook a1 and again the game goes on here\\xa0\\nit went off for another 15 to 20 moves but white\\xa0\\xa0 white is clearly better black's gonna lose his\\xa0\\npawn at a6 and be down by a pawn additionally\\xa0\\xa0 i have a very compact center and black has a\\xa0\\nweakness on h4 as well as these two weak pawns\\xa0\\xa0 on clean side so long term it should be winning\\xa0\\nfor white and i would go on to win this game\\xa0\\xa0 all right so sticking with the theme now we're\\xa0\\ngoing to move a little bit away from all these\\xa0\\xa0 variations with b4 e5 bishop b2 uh bish takes\\xa0\\nbefore bishop takes e5 so now you probably wonder\\xa0\\xa0 well okay why doesn't black just play a normal\\xa0\\nsetup what is the difference between the pawn\\xa0\\xa0 being on b3 versus b4 so after b4 e6 this is a\\xa0\\ngame another game from title tuesday i played\\xa0\\xa0 against francesco sonas bishop b2 knight to f6 is\\xa0\\nplayed here so now i play a3 of course black can\\xa0\\xa0 not take the pawn on b4 because after bishop g7 he\\xa0\\nwould lose the rook in the corner so knight f6 is\\xa0\\xa0 played so now i have to play a3 to guard the pawn\\xa0\\nd5 is played knight f3 bishop d6 all very logical\\xa0\\xa0 so far nothing too uh on nothing too surprising\\xa0\\nfrom either side so i go e3 castles and i place\\xa0\\xa0 pawn to c4 here sonus plays b6 i trade takes\\xa0\\nback the pawn on d5 go d4 bishop b7 knight c3\\xa0\\xa0 knight to e4 and now i have queen to b3 now\\xa0\\nthis is the big difference since a lot of these\\xa0\\xa0 positions are very similar to one b3 the real big\\xa0\\ndifference between b3 and b4 is specifically by\\xa0\\xa0 having the pawn on b4 i can now put the queen\\xa0\\non b3 so for example let me just set this up um\\xa0\\xa0 actually not quite sure how to set up on this\\xa0\\nanalysis where it seems a little bit off so\\xa0\\xa0 anyway the big difference though of course is that\\xa0\\nyou have this b3 square and in this case c5 is not\\xa0\\xa0 playable because i will just take back the pawn\\xa0\\nand after pawn takes you lose the bishop on b7\\xa0\\xa0 so therefore it's multi multifunctional first\\xa0\\nof all it stops at c5 pushes it black tries to\\xa0\\xa0 play normal normal sort of queen's indian nimzo\\xa0\\nindian setups and also you can put the queen on b3\\xa0\\xa0 as well so you have a little bit more space to\\xa0\\nplay with so queen b3 is happens in the game\\xa0\\xa0 rookie 8. now i go over to c1 again\\xa0\\ntrying to prevent this pawn push\\xa0\\xa0 a6 i go bishop d3 knight g5 and i go knight two\\xa0\\nof course by the way to point out one other thing\\xa0\\xa0 i can never take the pawn on d5 because after\\xa0\\nknight takes d5 bishop takes d5 queen takes d5\\xa0\\xa0 black as bishop takes b for this discovered check\\xa0\\nwinning the queen on d5 so i play bishop to d3\\xa0\\xa0 here knight to g5 is played by sonus i go knight\\xa0\\nto d2 it's now c6 is played because again i am\\xa0\\xa0 threatening to capture the pawn say black plays\\xa0\\na random move like h6 after knight t5 bishop d5\\xa0\\xa0 queen d5 you'll notice that bishop takes pawn is\\xa0\\nno longer a check because the knight is in the way\\xa0\\xa0 of this diagonal so c6 is played here now i go\\xa0\\nqueen to c2 h6 of course i am threatening to play\\xa0\\xa0 h4 remove the knight and then win the pawn on h7\\xa0\\nso h6 castles knight to d7 is played here i go f4\\xa0\\xa0 knight to e6 and this is where i make a mistake\\xa0\\nin the game in the game i play the move queen\\xa0\\xa0 to b3 but here after the straight four pawn to\\xa0\\nf5 knight to g5 e4 white should be a little bit\\xa0\\xa0 better here and it's pretty straightforward in\\xa0\\nterms of how to play also with the pawn being\\xa0\\xa0 on c6 you have this closed diagonal suspicion on\\xa0\\nb7 is not very well placed here so again this is\\xa0\\xa0 one illustration of of what the differences are\\xa0\\nbetween b3 b3 and b4 but also additionally how you\\xa0\\xa0 should play if your opponent choose to play a very\\xa0\\nstraightforward setup and pretend that you've done\\xa0\\xa0 nothing unusual alright so next game that we will\\xa0\\ntake a look at again sticking of the theme with\\xa0\\xa0 different setups here to to round it out is a game\\xa0\\nthat i played against rtm timofev a very strong\\xa0\\xa0 russian grand master also entitled tuesday so b4\\xa0\\nknight f6 is played i go bishop to b2 he plays\\xa0\\xa0 g6 now i go c4 bishop g7 knight to f3 again a big\\xa0\\ndifference is with the pawn being on b3 versus b4\\xa0\\xa0 is that black does not really have setups with c5\\xa0\\nhere so castles e3 b6 is played bishop e2 bishop\\xa0\\xa0 b7 now here for whatever reason i did not actually\\xa0\\nplay pawn to d4 i think this was my initial idea\\xa0\\xa0 um but for whatever reason i didn't do it but here\\xa0\\nwith the pawn on b4 versus b3 now ideas like c5\\xa0\\xa0 are not as effective for black instead i cancelled\\xa0\\nallowing c5 correctly i played queen to b3 here\\xa0\\xa0 and now timothev did something unusually chose\\xa0\\nto take the pawn on b4 i i would i would have\\xa0\\xa0 normally thought that it moved like knight c6\\xa0\\nis a little bit more natural because now if i\\xa0\\xa0 take the pawn on c5 here black can just take back\\xa0\\nand now if i were to try to grab the bishop on b7\\xa0\\xa0 after rook to b8 here there's a lot of pressure\\xa0\\non the b file here and black is completely fine so instead temo fav takes on b4 i play queen takes\\xa0\\nb4 knight to c6's play so now i go queen to a3\\xa0\\xa0 and teemo five plays pawn to d5 so here i take on\\xa0\\nd5 plays queen takes d5 and now i go knight c3 and\\xa0\\xa0 much like in the other games oddly enough even\\xa0\\nthough we haven't traded a b pawn for the e pawn\\xa0\\xa0 we have basically traded a b-pawn in essence for\\xa0\\na d-pawn so you have a similar structure with\\xa0\\xa0 blacks these pawns on the wing and white\\xa0\\nis getting the center with f2 e3 and d4\\xa0\\xa0 it's so queen a5 is played now i go queen to b3\\xa0\\nqueen to b4 is played and now i play bishop to a3\\xa0\\xa0 so team of fave trades the queens plays\\xa0\\nrook d8 to attack the pawn but now i play d4\\xa0\\xa0 controlling the center here i have this pawn chain\\xa0\\nf2 e3 d4 plays e6 to sidestep the weakness on e7\\xa0\\xa0 and now i play rook c1 and again as i've\\xa0\\nhighlighted this is an opening video so i don't\\xa0\\xa0 want to get too deep into the weeds of entire\\xa0\\ngames for the most part but what i would say is\\xa0\\xa0 here even though the computer says about even it's\\xa0\\na little bit easier for white to play here and i\\xa0\\xa0 would go on to win this game eventually proving\\xa0\\nthat these pawns and center are a little bit more\\xa0\\xa0 important these pawns on the edge of the board all\\xa0\\nright and for the final game which we're going to\\xa0\\xa0 go over this is an illustration of why even if you\\xa0\\nthink it's a very straightforward setup to play\\xa0\\xa0 with white you do have to be very very careful\\xa0\\nfrom the get-go so i played b4 in this game also\\xa0\\xa0 from title tuesday against mikhail demidob a\\xa0\\nvery strong grandmaster i believe from belarus\\xa0\\xa0 if i'm not mistaken so i go b4 and he plays c6 he\\xa0\\ngoes c6 here and i remember since i was streaming\\xa0\\xa0 this game so those of you want to go find that\\xa0\\nfind the video this title tuesday from june 1st\\xa0\\xa0 of 2021 i thought okay i just played something\\xa0\\nnormal we're going to develop and we'll get a\\xa0\\xa0 game unfortunately after i play the move knight\\xa0\\nto f3 here demidov plays at 85 and already it's\\xa0\\xa0 a very tricky position to play now oddly enough\\xa0\\nthe computer says that you can play b5 and if\\xa0\\xa0 black grabs this extra pawn you can play e4 d4 a3\\xa0\\nand play a crazy wing gamut here or something like\\xa0\\xa0 e6 and d4 and there's a lot of piece play it's a\\xa0\\nvery very rich position who knows exactly what is\\xa0\\xa0 going on but having not known that after a5 i i\\xa0\\nalready was in a lot of trouble in this game so\\xa0\\xa0 here i took on a5 and now demi dawg plays knight\\xa0\\nf6 now it's worth noting that after c6 on move one\\xa0\\xa0 probably the correct way to play this i haven't\\xa0\\nlooked super in depth uh with any engines on this\\xa0\\xa0 is to play something like c4 here and now if\\xa0\\nblack tries to play a5 on the wing right away you\\xa0\\xa0 can play something like b5 pawn takes pawn pawn\\xa0\\ntakes with the idea of bishop b2 knight f3 and e3\\xa0\\xa0 and very simple development and the game proceeds\\xa0\\npretty pretty naturally i would say for both sides\\xa0\\xa0 so after c6 i play knight to f3 a5 is played\\xa0\\nhere by demi dog so i take he goes knight f6\\xa0\\xa0 of course i cannot play a3 trying to keep the pawn\\xa0\\nchain alive because after pawn takes pawn takes i\\xa0\\xa0 would simply lose the rook on a1 here so instead i\\xa0\\ntake he goes knight f6 he does not need to rush to\\xa0\\xa0 capture this pawn on a5 play c4 pawn to d5 play\\xa0\\ne3 try to play very similar setup to what i did\\xa0\\xa0 in a lot of the other games just play like bishop\\xa0\\ne2 bishop b2 castles and pretend nothing is wrong\\xa0\\xa0 but demi dog just credit plays this very well so\\xa0\\ni play queen he plays queen a5 i go knight c3 and\\xa0\\xa0 immediately he plays pawn to g6 so now i go push\\xa0\\nb2 bishop to g7 and already it's very tricky for\\xa0\\xa0 white to play in the game here i make a mistake\\xa0\\ni play this move rook to d1 but it's already\\xa0\\xa0 difficult because if i play castles for example\\xa0\\nblack is knight to e4 and this diagonal is a very\\xa0\\xa0 very big problem here there's not much that i can\\xa0\\nreally do and after and if i play move like bishop\\xa0\\xa0 b2 again there are tricks where black and take\\xa0\\non c4 i take back and maybe he can castle castle\\xa0\\xa0 and play knight e4 and it feels very shaky again\\xa0\\nwith this open diagonal towards the bishop on b2 so i play rook b1 in the game hoping that if\\xa0\\nblack state plays bishop f5 trying to target the\\xa0\\xa0 rook i can just take the pawn on b7 but demidoff\\xa0\\ncastles and i castle back and now after knight e4\\xa0\\xa0 already this position is very very bad for\\xa0\\nwhite to play if i trade the knights on e4\\xa0\\xa0 after takes takes knight on f3 is weak said play\\xa0\\nknight d4 black can simply go queen takes a2\\xa0\\xa0 and already the position is really falling apart\\xa0\\ni'm down upon if i do something like bishop b2\\xa0\\xa0 black can now go c5 and i have problems with\\xa0\\nthe bishop and the knight and everything is\\xa0\\xa0 really really bad here so i don't really want to\\xa0\\ntrade the knight so in the game i play bishop to\\xa0\\xa0 b2 and after knight takes c3 bishop takes c3\\xa0\\nwe trade everything off and here he actually\\xa0\\xa0 makes a mistake dummy dove takes on c3 if he had\\xa0\\ntaken the pawn on c4 here after bishop takes c4\\xa0\\xa0 queen takes c3 black is simply up a pawn and\\xa0\\nmuch better here and if i don't take the pawn\\xa0\\xa0 on c4 there aren't really many other moves that\\xa0\\nmake sense say something like queen d4 black can\\xa0\\xa0 play b5 guards guards upon on c4 and again i'm\\xa0\\ndown a pawn and i'm probably close to lost here\\xa0\\xa0 instead he takes on c3 and now after\\xa0\\npawn takes pawn takes queen takes\\xa0\\xa0 knight c6 rook c1 i was able to completely\\xa0\\nequalize in the game and make a draw but the moral\\xa0\\xa0 of the story from this game is that no matter\\xa0\\nhow original you try to be with your openings\\xa0\\xa0 you always have to be aware of tricks from the\\xa0\\nget-go now for those of you guys who are more\\xa0\\xa0 more experienced or people who are polish\\xa0\\nthe polish polish opening aficionados you\\xa0\\xa0 can obviously maybe take a look at that line that\\xa0\\ni mentioned with knight f3 a5 b5 and reach your\\xa0\\xa0 own conclusions but overall the main point is that\\xa0\\neven when you try to surprise your opponent you'd\\xa0\\xa0 be very sharp and very aware from the get-go all\\xa0\\nright so i hope you enjoyed you you enjoyed these\\xa0\\xa0 these games in the polish opening as i'm still\\xa0\\nstuck here in poland um i will probably be back\\xa0\\xa0 i will be streaming i hope to do some more youtube\\xa0\\nspecific content as well for you guys i appreciate\\xa0\\xa0 everybody for hitting that subscribe button uh\\xa0\\nwhen you have the option so thank you so much\\xa0\\xa0 and and hopefully you enjoy the video have\\xa0\\na good one you guys see from america soon you\",\n",

       " \"Invasion of Poland September 1st through October 6th, 1939 World War II The German invasion of Poland began on September 1st, 1939 and besides Germany and Poland brought the United Kingdom and France into the war. German preparations for the invasion started months before the attack and included not only military preparations, but also aggressive propaganda and similar actions to justify German aggression against Poland. Operation Himmler, also known as the operation Canned Goods was a false flag operation conducted in order to make the appearance of Polish aggression towards Germany. The most famous action of the operation was the Gliwitz incident on August 31st 1939. The Germans staged an attack on a radio station in Gliwitz Making it look as it was attacked by Poles and broadcasted a false call to Poles in Germany to rise against Hitler. Along with other similar staged incidents the Germans used this event as an excuse to attack Poland. Contrary to the Germans who had already disposed their units along the border with Poland before the attack, the poles had delayed their mobilization of their troops as they were pressured by their British and French allies not to do it. They believed that mobilization would only provoke Hitler and give him a reason to violate peace on the European continent . For that reason, the Polish forces didn't gather all their troops in time by September 1st when the Germans attacked them. Fall Weiss or Case White was the German plan to invade Poland from three directions through the north from Prussia and Northeastern Germany. A main attack through the Western border of Poland from East Germany and through the South from the border of the puppet state of Slovakia. Two army groups north and south were ordered to encircle the Polish troops and to meet near Warsaw. For the invasion, the German forces engaged two thirds of their infantry: almost all Panzer units and more than 2,000 planes leaving the rest of its units on Germany's western border in case of a French attack Since the Germans anticipated that the British and French would enter the war once Poland was attacked, they planned to finish the invasion quickly before the French and British troops would have time to mobilize. The invasion began in the early hours of September 1st with the guns of a German battleship which was visiting the Polish port of Danzig opening fire. The Polish defense known as plan West anticipated the protection of the entire border with Germany and Slovakia since this region was the industrial heart of the country. This proved to be a big mistake since most of the units couldn't made the quick maneuvers of German Panzer troops, leaving them to become surrounded. The first days of the invasion saw intense German attacks for both land and air. The Luftwaffe gained air superiority immediately, even though the Polish pilots put up a brave resistance. Attacks made by German Panzer troops were so intense that Polish units were forced to retreat from their defensive positions after the first days of combat. France and the United Kingdom declared war on Germany on September 3rd, but without any true support. The German forces used their tactic of Blitzkrieg - a swift combined arms attack that overwhelmed the enemy and surrounded them. German technological and numerical superiority proved to be a decisive feature of the campaign that Poland just couldn't oppose However, the Polish army did try to counter-attack the German forces at the Battle of Zura near Warsaw. During the 10 days of the battle from September 9 to September 18, the Polish forces were destroyed by the attacks from the Luftwaffe and Panzer units. In the two weeks of the invasion, the whole of Western Poland was conquered. Where that they couldn't establish any kind of tactical advantage, Polish command decided to retreat its troops to the southeastern part of the country, where there was a hilly landscape suitable for organizing a proper resistance. The vicinity of the Romanian border also gave the opportunity to withdraw from the country. The Polish plan was to establish a solid defence in order to prolong the invasion for a French and British response on the west. However, the British and French support would never come. The French only engaged in a small limited skirmish in the Saar land with no effect. The Polish plans proved futile went on September 17th, the Soviet Union suddenly violated a non-aggression pact at hand with Poland and attacked it with a pretext to protect the Belarusian and Ukrainian population. The Soviet invasion of Poland was pre-arranged with Germany on August 23rd 1939 with the notorious Molotov Ribbentrop non-aggression pact. This pact not only anticipated friendly behavior between the two countries, but also a joint invasion of Poland and its division afterwards. When 800,000 Red Army soldiers entered Poland, the Polish forces knew that it couldn't oppose the enemies on two fronts. Even though the Poles continued to resist the German forces like in the Battle of Tomaszow Lubelski all efforts were futile. Polish units were being surrounded everywhere and such was the case with Polish cities the capital of Poland Warsaw surrendered on September 27th after 16 days of struggle. The last Polish unit surrendered on October 6th after the Battle of Kock. Facing more powerful and numerous enemies on two fronts and abandoned by its allies, Poland suffered defeat. After it had been defeated Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union divided its territory, thus ending the Second Republic of Poland. For the German forces the Polish campaign helped invaluable lessons for future operations that led to the conquest of Europe. Even though defeated on the battlefield what was left of the Polish military continued to fight with the British forces until the end of the war.

       " \"the war against the Nazis and Hitler was among the most justified conflicts in history yet by the time the Allied victory had become inevitable it had become clear that there were additional political goals and for the USSR it was the domination in control of Eastern Europe both to serve as a potential buffer and to gain new allies we're planning to cover the Soviet ization of the Eastern Europe in detail but in this video we'll talk about Poland as its transformation had begun before the end of the war and would play a crucial role in our story going forward the second world war in Europe began in 1939 when Nazi Germany invaded Poland despite a gallant and somewhat unexpected resistance by Polish forces Poland's fate was sealed when 16 days after German forces crossed into Poland in the West Soviet forces invaded from the east fulfilling the secret terms of the molotov-ribbentrop pact that had been signed between the Soviet Union and Germany in late August the Polish government fled to London and established itself there as the legitimate and globally recognized government in exile the poles throughout the war continued their resistance to their occupiers both Nazi and Soviet and then only Nazi after 1941 when the German invasion of the Soviet Union occurred the resistance was carried out by various formal and irregular military organizations of which the Home Army or Army Akiva a.k was the most prominent the a.k was firmly loyal to the london-based government in exile the culmination of this resistance was the 1944 warsaw uprising launched in august as Soviet forces neared the city the uprising was brutally repressed by the Germans over the course of weeks and months as the Red Army held its positions allowing the Germans to effectively destroy the aka as a fighting force Stalin aiming to take complete control over Poland sponsored the establishment in 1944 of a new government in Poland the Polish committee of national liberation more commonly known as the Lublin Committee the Loveland committee set up as an alternative to the London polls was composed of Soviet trained communists and backed by the army allude over the People's Army anywhere from 15,000 to 60,000 men depending on whose estimates are used the People's Army was considerably smaller than the approximate 400,000 men of the a.k as the Soviet Union moved into polish territory through 1944 it immediately began installing members of the Lublin committee into power positions in the liberated territory despite the Soviet agreement that was made at the Yalta Conference calling for free and unfettered elections in Poland to allow the establishment of government of national unity the Soviet ization of Poland was happening simultaneously with the expulsion of the Germans the Lublin committee began to issue its manifesto which in combination with the severe weakening of the AKA after the warsaw uprising helped increase the popularity of the communists the most notable change was the land reform decree in september 1944 from which more than 1 million peasant poles got land at the same time numerous factories in the newly liberated territory were taken over by workers who created workers councils soviets to manage them the provisional government formally established in january 1945 was of course dominated by communists and was headed by eduardo so kamarowsky non leftists were shut out of the government and all security was being handled by the NKVD the Soviet secret police the government of Poland was made accountable to the unelected communist dominated state National Council the political landscape in Poland as the war was ending was dominated by the left and non leftist forces were banned and persecuted only one prominent non-communist political force was allowed to operate the peasants party headed by the former prime minister of the London poles stanislav Mikolajczyk sixteen representatives of the Polish underground state itself vehemently opposed Soviet occupation were abducted by the NKVD and brought to Moscow where show trials were held the group included the commander-in-chief of the Home Army Leopold o cool ski and the former Deputy Prime Minister yen stanislav yankovsky as well as several other ranking representatives of the london poles and the Polish underground state of the 16:13 was sentenced to various terms of arrest and some of those were allegedly murdered while serving their sentences the first electoral test of the communist government in Poland came in 1946 with a referendum asking three questions the first was if the people were in favor of abolishing the Senate the second was if they agreed to the nationalization of industry in the consolidation of socialist economies and the third question was if the poles were in favor of the changes to their western border the official results indicated that the poles voted in favor of all three proposals however there were also serious allegations of widespread voter fraud in kakaako where the opposition managed to ensure a fair vote the votes against the questions were 84 percent 59 percent and 30 percent for the three questions this significantly differed from the official results however the objections of the opposition were it simply ignored the referendum led to industry being nationalized the implementation of the state-led economy and a unicameral Sam Parliament the next stage in the consolidation of power by the Communists came during the 1947 parliamentary elections the Democratic bloc led by the Soviet trained Boleslav bare-root and his Workers Party faced off against the opposition People's Party led by Mikolajczyk the campaign was marked by violence and persecution against the opposition over 80,000 members of the People's Party were arrested mostly for false charges in the month leading up to the election of these people approximately 100 were murdered by this Polish secret police the uvp these actions as well as widespread vote falsification on the day of the election led to Beirut in the democratic bloc winning 394 of the 434 seats in Sam Michael I check only secured 28 the 1947 legislative elections ensured the total domination of Poland by the communists as Beirut was elected president while make a light Chuck and other opposition leaders fled the country as a result of further prosecution the People's Party soon dissolved with the left wing of the party merging with the ruling Democratic bloc the same fate awaited the Polish Socialist Party and several other smaller what emerged was the Polish United Workers Party which then went on to control Poland for the next four decades only two other parties were allowed to function but as they did not oppose the government their sole purpose was to create the illusion of a multi-party system at this time Vladislav Gomulka was the head of the Communist Party but was opposed to the stylist approach a rule where the party was controlled by Moscow with very little independence Homolka was one of the architects of the Communist consolidation in Poland and very much involved in the falsification of election results and persecution of political opponents he was very much a communist but wanted to be able to bake the specifics of Poland into consideration when creating policies as a result of what amounted to an anti Stalinist stance he was ousted from the Communist Party labeled a right-wing nationalist deviator and arrested barrowed took charge of the Communist Party repression such as these were common against people or groups who were determined to be against the government direction and could even extend to members and factions of the ruling party the Ministry of Public Security and BP and the Department of Security eub were the main tools of state repression there are estimates that at one point there was one ub agent for every 800 Polish citizens with the consolidation of communist power came the emergence of a new political and bureaucratic elite the nomenclature Oh replacing the old political and economic elite it was made up of the leaders of the Communist Party at both the central and regional levels the heads of factories industrial institutions and top-ranking security and military officials nomenclature aware people considered ideologically reliable and enjoyed many privileges in exchange for the influence which they exerted in society [Music] Poland heavily damaged in the warriors embarked on a path of rapid reconstruction and industrialization the three-year plan on reconstructing the economy was adopted in Poland to replace the 30% of production and infrastructure that was lost during the war the plan was dedicated to finding a balance between the private sector the public sector and cooperatives and did not emphasize an ideological approach the aim was to rebuild the country and raise the living conditions of the Polish people the plan was deemed a success in its ability as it helped rebuild industry but fell short in meeting agricultural output targets as a result of attempts at collectivization large pieces of land were being taken away from their previous owners and divided between farmers and peasants although the government aimed for soviet-style collective farms this created a great deal of resentment among the peasants and farmers and many simply continued to grow their own agricultural products by the end of the three year plan agricultural output remained below pre-war levels industrialization however doubled its production between 1947 and 1950 there were fundamental changes in demographics happening at the same time over one point eight million people moved into the cities finding work in the booming industrial sector as well as the reconstruction of the nation along with this in line with agreements made at the Potsdam Conference the ethnic German population that had been living in Poland was expelled west into Germany while the ethnic Polish populations in Ukraine and Belarus were relocated into Poland the success found in industrialization as a result of the merging Soviet market for polish products allowed Poland to increase its national outcome by the end of the 1940s this happened despite the nationalization of all industry private trade and enterprise it also happened in the face of the refusal of Poland to partake in the Marshall Plan the american-led plan for the rebuilding of Europe this refusal was the direct result of pressure on Poland from Moscow Poland by this time was rejecting the market economy and removing all remnants of democracy with the dissolution of opposition parties and the central planning office by 1950 Poland had transitioned to a centrally planned state economy with Beirut and his Stalinists at the helm a new six-year plan was launched at this time with an emphasis on heavy industry instead of the light consumer industry that had been the focus the first three year plan as a result despite the flourishing of heavy industry the services and food industries suffered and one would expect the living standards of poles began to fall the Soviet ization of Poland was a painful process for a country that had already suffered heavily during the war the liberation from Nazi occupation had resulted in Soviet occupation and Poland subsequently became a Soviet satellite state the ruling Communist elite depended on the Soviet Union for its political and economic choices political competition was not allowed and opponents were persecuted including the Catholic Church and the remaining intelligentsia that had survived the war the policies adopted in Poland which focused on rapid industrialization were beneficial towards the rebuilding of the nation but the focus on heavy industry agriculture elective ization and the refusal to participate in the Marshall Plan all ultimately harmed the poles significantly the Soviet dependent communist regime would remain in control of Poland for the next four decades the post-war period was a diplomatic mess and the Soviet ization of Poland proved that the world needed an international structure to deal with the current and potential future crises and we'll discuss this more in future videos so make sure you're subscribed to our channel and have

       " \"Poland is changing. Every year the country celebrates its national\\nIndependence Day in the capital, Warsaw. There are parades and speeches\\nBut in 2017, Poland’s Independence Day made worldwide news because of these signs: 60,000 people showed up for a march led by\\nNationalist and white-supremacist groups. That’s because they have reason to celebrate,\\ntoo. Poland’s right-wing political party, PiS,\\nis in power. After winning the Presidency and a majority\\nin Parliament, they've ignored the constitution, Taken over the courts, purged the military,\\nand cracked down on the media. PiS is bringing authoritarianism back to Poland\\nand openly rebelling against the European Union. It’s a shocking turn for a country that,\\njust a few years ago was hailed as one of Europe’s most promising young democracies. So, how did this happen? And can it be stopped? It was an old story to the Polish population\\n- conquest, subjugation, enslavement. it had happened before in Poland’s troubled\\nhistory but never with such inhumanity Poland had a traumatic 20th century. It was invaded twice during World War Two. First by the Germans and then by the Soviets...\\n...who re-established the country after the war, but as a communist state under their\\ncontrol. In fact, Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin directly\\ncontributed to a draft of Poland's constitution, which was formalized in 1952. These are his handwritten notes. For the next several decades, Poland developed\\nvery little while it was cut off from the rest of the world. It became one of several Soviet-backed, communist\\ncountries in Central and Eastern Europe that made up the Soviet bloc. That started to change in the 1980s. Polish unions started organizing huge strikes\\nagainst the communist government. The movement came to be called Solidarity\\nand it grabbed the attention of the world. In 1989, the communist government caved to\\nthe pressure and agreed to let non-communist parties run in the elections. Solidarity and democratic candidates went\\non to win the majority of parliament and the presidency. They established the Republic of Poland and\\nbecame the first country in Europe to topple communism. The rest of the Soviet bloc soon followed. This posed a challenge for Western Europe. We cannot aim at anything less than the union\\nof Europe as a whole and we look with confidence for the day that union is achieved Since the end of World War Two, the continent’s\\ndemocracies had been growing closer; signing free trade deals that became the precursor\\nto today’s European Union. At first, the trade deals just covered coal\\nand steel, but as they grew to include agriculture, energy, and other markets, more countries\\njoined-- making Europe more economically and politically integrated than it had ever been\\nbefore. As the former Soviet bloc countries started\\nestablishing democracies of their own; Western Europe needed to find a way to include them. So in 1993, the established EU countries came\\nup with a strict checklist for admitting new members. New member-states needed to have a free market\\neconomy, respect human rights and the rule of law. Meaning courts had to be independent and impartial--\\nso everyone could get a fair trial. These EU rules helped bring former-communist\\ncountries in while also keeping them from sliding back into authoritarianism. They were designed to keep the peace in Europe. Poland joined the EU in 2004 and because of\\nSolidarity's success it became one of the most promising new member. Poland was given more money than any other\\nEU country which it used to build highways, schools, hospitals, and modern infrastructure. The country’s economy grew more than any\\nother ex-communist country. Each year after it joined, Poland received\\nmillions of Euros to help fund highways, schools, hospitals, and modern infrastructure. By 2014, Poland became one of the EU’s strongest\\nand most resilient members. It even avoided the recession in 2009 that\\ncrippled economies worldwide. Polling showed 72% of Poles were satisfied\\nwith EU membership. More than any other member state. Minister of Foreign Affairs Radosław Sikorski:\\n“Ladies & Gentleman, 10 years ago we joined the European Union. We did not become part of the EU on a whim. We became part of the union because we put\\nin tremendous efforts to build a democracy and a free market economy; two pillars of\\na united Europe.” And Poland’s charismatic, pro-EU Prime minister,\\nDonald Tusk, was chosen to become president of the EU’s European Council. But in his absence, leaders with a very different\\nvision for Poland's future rose to power. In 2015 PiS, Poland’s right-wing party,\\nshocked the world and won an absolute majority in the parliament. Since 2001, PiS had been led by former-Solidarity\\nleaders Lech and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who felt that Poland’s center-left parties had become\\nelitist and corrupt. It appealed to Poland’s conservative population\\nin rural areas. PiS only earned 38% of the vote in 2015, on\\npar with the previous election results, but after Tusk left for the EU, his coalition\\nof center-left parties fell apart, making room for the right-wing party to take over.h According to PiS, after decades of Soviet\\ncontrol, Poland was now being controlled by the EU. So when it came into power, it pledged to\\ntake back Poland’s independence … legally or illegally. The party already controlled BOTH HOUSE OF\\nParliament and the Presidency, so it initiated a hostile takeover of the judicial branch. First it packed this Constitutional court\\nwith loyal judges and then forced out more than a third of the judges in this other court. Both acts were illegal under the Polish constitution,\\nbut the PiS-majority parliament and Presidency signed them into law anyway. The party also fired over 11,000 civil-service\\nworkers and at least 280 military officers, calling them ex-communists. It cracked down on the media. It started leveling fines on news organizations\\nwhen it didn’t like their coverage. Meanwhile, it’s been using Polish nationalism\\nto justify these moves. Remember this 2017 controversial march? A PiS politician called it “a beautiful\\nsite” While the party cracked down on protests against\\ntheir authoritarian moves. As PiS tightened its grip on Poland, the EU\\nissued several warnings to stop it from breaking its rules…. But PiS ignored them. “It is with a heavy heart that we have decided\\nto initiate Article 7.1”, “But the facts leave us with no choice.” In December 2017, the EU invoked Article 7--\\nits nuclear option-- for the first time in its history. It allows the EU to strip a member of its\\nvoting rights if it feels it is breaking the criteria it established in 1993. // a significant number of laws have been\\nadopted… which put at serious risk the independence of the judiciary and separation of powers,\\nin Poland//. According to the EU, the PiS purging of the\\ncourts violates the country’s commitment to respecting the rule of law. The problem for the EU is that Article 7 is\\nnot going to work. The punishment requires a unanimous vote by\\nall EU countries -- and there is one country that has sworn to protect Poland... Hungary, another former Soviet bloc country,\\nhas taken a turn towards authoritarianism under President Viktor Orban. And he vowed to veto any punishment against\\nPoland. So PiS continues to systematically strip…\\non Poland while still receiving huge sums of money from the EU. It’s proving that a member country can stay\\nin the EU, reap its economic benefits, while ignoring its rules on rule of law. PiS is proving that it's possible to reap\\nthe economic benefits of EU membership while flouting the rule of law. And that has sparked an existential crisis\\nfor the EU... The rules that were written to prevent authoritarianism\\nfrom ever re-appearing in Europe, aren’t being followed, and there’s not much it\\ncan do about it. The EU could try cutting off Poland’s funding\\nbut it’s unclear how that would work. So for now, the EU remains in a crisis. For decades it’s tried to keep Europe democratic. But Poland, once the EU’s most promising\\nnew addition, is Is now threatening to unravel the whole thing.\",\n",

now that being said what were the highlights\\xa0\\xa0 for you of that list so i really thoroughly\\xa0\\nenjoyed this trip through poland and to be\\xa0\\xa0 honest there was definitely some things that\\xa0\\nstood out for me one of the things that really\\xa0\\xa0 stood out for me especially in the beginning\\xa0\\nof our poland trip was the Wieliczka salt mine\\xa0\\xa0 that was absolutely out of this world it was\\xa0\\nan experience that we i think will never forget\\xa0\\xa0 and it is obviously a huge attraction\\xa0\\nthat pulls many many tourists into poland\\xa0\\xa0 and for me that really was the first thing in\\xa0\\npoland that we did where i was like oh my god this\\xa0\\xa0 place is amazing and it's such it's really really\\xa0\\nreally worth seeing it's still on my list of where\\xa0\\xa0 we should get married so yeah well there you\\xa0\\ngo so it's an incredibly beautiful place 100%\\xa0\\xa0 must visit the Wieliczka mines and another\\xa0\\nplace for me that i really enjoyed was Wrocław\\xa0\\xa0 the city of Wrocław i loved all of the dwarfs i\\xa0\\nloved the creative atmosphere that Wrocław had\\xa0\\xa0 i think it was a really incredible city\\xa0\\nsomewhere that is not often talked about\\xa0\\xa0 amongst many europeans as being like a\\xa0\\nweekend getaway or somewhere where you can go\\xa0\\xa0 and just relax have some hot drink a coffee\\xa0\\nyou know and enjoy your weekend there i think\\xa0\\xa0 it's a perfect getaway destination and\\xa0\\nit's not added to lists enough i think\\xa0\\xa0 that it needs to be spoken about a little bit\\xa0\\nmore i think it was a very underrated destination\\xa0\\xa0 in terms of cities another one for me that i\\xa0\\nwould add as a highlight would be Olsztyn as well\\xa0\\xa0 Olsztyn you have the amazing lakes there\\xa0 Olsztyn is kind of it's part of Warmia\\xa0\\xa0 and a lot of you guys said that it is the varmia\\xa0\\nregion not the mazury region and the lakes there\\xa0\\xa0 and the general vibe there was just unbelievable\\xa0\\nso that would be my kind of top three for you\\xa0\\xa0 what's your highlights it's so difficult to decide\\xa0\\nto be honest i'm looking at this list and trying\\xa0\\xa0 to figure out which one my top three are but it's\\xa0\\nso so difficult in no specific order i would\\xa0\\xa0 probably put zakopane in the top three especially\\xa0\\nespecially the morskie oko and the tatras like the\\xa0\\xa0 region there that was so stunning just to kind\\xa0\\nof hike in that area and it was just so surreal\\xa0\\xa0 like it's it's you can not like you cannot imagine\\xa0\\nwhat it's like if you go there you see a video and\\xa0\\xa0 you're like oh yeah okay i know what's going\\xa0\\nto come i know what the area looks like but no\\xa0\\xa0 video in this world could ever bring across how\\xa0\\nbeautiful it is up there and i'm sure that one\\xa0\\xa0 day we will go back to the tatras to hike some\\xa0\\nmore because i feel like we did some hiking but\\xa0\\xa0 not as extensively as we should have we missed\\xa0\\nout on a lot of different things there yeah and\\xa0\\xa0 another favorite of mine i would probably put\\xa0\\nłódź in the mix as well which is great but just\\xa0\\xa0 because of how surprising it was i heard or we\\xa0\\nheard so many negative things beforehand and\\xa0\\xa0 if you watch our channel for a longer time you\\xa0\\nknow exactly if somebody says something negative\\xa0\\xa0 we are going there so łódź was definitely\\xa0\\nvery very high up on that list for me as well\\xa0\\xa0 specifically the piotrkovska street it was just\\xa0\\nso beautiful it's such a stunning area obviously\\xa0\\xa0 łódź has bad sides łódź has good sides but\\xa0\\ni feel like łódź definitely should make more\\xa0\\xa0 people's lists in order to showcase exactly\\xa0\\nwhat the city has to offer because there's so\\xa0\\xa0 much culture there and it's just stunning and i\\xa0\\nreally feel like everybody should take at least\\xa0\\xa0 the weekend out of their year to visit łódź and\\xa0\\njust drink a coffee on the Piotrkovska street and\\xa0\\xa0 my can i do a top four maybe yeah yeah okay so\\xa0\\nthen would probably be toruń and malbork those two\\xa0\\xa0 cities were really really surprising for me i'm\\xa0\\na history lover myself so you can imagine toruń and malbork both of them with especially malbork\\xa0\\nwith the largest castle in europe i know a lot of\\xa0\\xa0 people were commenting it's not the largest but it\\xa0\\nis it is just circumference wise it is the largest\\xa0\\xa0 castle in the world and i believe just building\\xa0\\nwise it is the largest red brick castle in europe\\xa0\\xa0 so that area by itself is just so so stunning and\\xa0\\ndefinitely worth visiting i think i think it took\\xa0\\xa0 us around five and a half or six hours to just get\\xa0\\nthrough that castle because we are we were trying\\xa0\\xa0 to see everything it was crazy and at the end both\\xa0\\nof us were just kind of going on walking on all\\xa0\\xa0 fours like crawling basically but we did it we saw\\xa0\\nthe entire castle and toruń specifically i feel\\xa0\\xa0 like just the entire city is so so stunning with\\xa0\\nthe whole gingerbread history behind it we ate\\xa0\\xa0 our body weight in gingerbread i think in the week\\xa0\\nthat we were in toruń and it's just just being\\xa0\\xa0 there makes you feel like you're walking through\\xa0\\na fairy tale so toruń makes the list for me as\\xa0\\xa0 well awesome so that was both of our highlights of\\xa0\\nthe polish trip that we had and to be honest what\\xa0\\xa0 going on this trip and being in poland for such a\\xa0\\nlong extended period of time as tourists it really\\xa0\\xa0 makes you

       " \"In March 1604, an unknown young man\\xa0\\ncame to the court of King Sigismund III\\xa0\\xa0 in Krakow. He met with the Polish King and\\xa0\\nintroduced himself as Dmitry Ivanovich,\\xa0\\xa0 the son of the deceased Tsar\\xa0\\nof Russia Ivan the Terrible,\\xa0\\xa0 and the brother of the last Russian Tsar\\xa0\\nof the Rurik dynasty, Fyodor I Ivanovich.\\xa0\\xa0 This meant that he was the legitimate heir to the\\xa0\\nRussian throne, and the entire Tsardom, which was\\xa0\\xa0 going through a difficult period of crisis due\\xa0\\nto the extinction of the ruling Rurik dynasty. \\n\\xa0 In addition to rebellions and battles for\\xa0\\nthe throne, Russia was hit by a huge famine\\xa0\\xa0 in which hundreds of thousands of people died.\\xa0\\nThis period is known as the Time of Troubles.\\xa0\\xa0 Until then, it was believed Tsar Dmitry Ivanovich,\\xa0\\xa0 the youngest son of Ivan the Terrible, had died\\xa0\\n13 years earlier under mysterious circumstances.\\xa0\\xa0 So it was a minor miracle when he arrived in\\xa0\\nKrakow to ask Sigismund and the Polish nobles\\xa0\\xa0 for support in overthrowing the usurper\\xa0\\nof the Russian throne, Boris Godunov. \\n\\xa0 Privately, many Polish and Lithuanian magnates\\xa0\\ndoubted Dmitry’s aristocratic origins.\\xa0\\xa0 But they conveniently stayed silent on\\xa0\\nthe matter, for their ambition was to take\\xa0\\xa0 advantage of the vast Russian territories.\\nTo garner support with the Polish king,\\xa0\\xa0 Dmitry converted to Catholicism and promised\\xa0\\nterritorial concessions if he became Russian Tsar.\\xa0\\xa0 Sigismund saw this as an opportunity to expand his\\xa0\\ninfluence towards Russia, while the proponents of\\xa0\\xa0 Catholicism wanted to use this to spread their\\xa0\\nreligion to the east. In addition, the idea for\\xa0\\xa0 the formation of the Polish-Lithuanian-Muscovite\\xa0\\nCommonwealth was again at the top of the agenda. \\n\\xa0 However, with his armies busy on other fronts,\\xa0\\nthe Polish king could not officially support\\xa0\\xa0 this enterprise. BUT, he gave a handsome sum of\\xa0\\nmoney to this young man, who claimed to be Dmitry,\\xa0\\xa0 to hire mercenary troops, while some of\\xa0\\nthe nobles of the Commonwealth provided the\\xa0\\xa0 majority of the army in support of this campaign.\\nSoon, news that Tsarevich Dmitry Ivanovich was\\xa0\\xa0 coming with an army reached Moscow. Alarmed, Tsar\\xa0\\nBoris Godunov went public and spread the story\\xa0\\xa0 that the man who pretended to be Dmitry Ivanovich\\xa0\\nwas actually a runaway monk Yuri Otrepyev,\\xa0\\xa0 and that the real Dmitry died 13 years ago,\\xa0\\nin 1591. But despite Godunov’s declarations,\\xa0\\xa0 his popularity sharply declined, as he lost\\xa0\\nsupport of an ever-larger number of nobles. \\n\\xa0 By the fall of 1604, Dmitry had gathered\\xa0\\naround 1,600 soldiers from Poland,\\xa0\\xa0 2,000 Cossacks from Ukraine, and some mercenaries.\\xa0\\nAnd then, in October, he invaded Russia.\\n\\xa0 Early on Dmitry had the advantage and conquered\\xa0\\ncertain cities without encountering much\\xa0\\xa0 resistance. But soon he suffered a heavy\\xa0\\ndefeat in the Battle of Dobrynichi. \\n\\xa0 As fortune would have it, he overcame\\xa0\\nthis difficult situation exclusively\\xa0\\xa0 due to the sudden death of Tsar\\xa0\\nBoris Godunov in April 1605.\\n\\xa0 Boris’ son Fyodor II Godunov ascended the throne.\\xa0\\nBut both he and his mother were killed soon after.\\xa0\\xa0 In June, the man claiming to be\\xa0\\nDmitry triumphantly entered Moscow\\xa0\\xa0 and was crowned Russian Tsar.\\nTo strengthen his alliance with Poland,\\xa0\\xa0 he married a Polish noblewoman Marina Mniszech,\\xa0\\nwho became the Russian Tsarina, in May 1606.\\n\\xa0 But the situation quickly deteriorated from there\\xa0\\nfor the new Tsar. Russian boyars were quick to\\xa0\\xa0 notice that Dmitry was surrounded by foreigners at\\xa0\\nhis court, primarily Poles. The strong influence\\xa0\\xa0 of the Catholic Church at the palace was also\\xa0\\na source of irritation. The last straw was that\\xa0\\xa0 the new Tsarina Marina did not convert to\\xa0\\nOrthodoxy, which was a tradition in Russia.\\xa0\\xa0 Fearing westernization of Russia, the boyars\\xa0\\nplotted an attack on the Kremlin. False Dmitry\\xa0\\xa0 was killed, cremated, and his ashes fired\\xa0\\nfrom a cannon in the direction of Poland.\\xa0\\xa0 Vasily IV Shuisky, a leading Russian boyar\\xa0\\nwith distant origins from the Rurik dynasty\\xa0\\xa0 was proclaimed Tsar of Russia. Further unrest\\xa0\\nfollowed, with Moscow itself besieged. However,\\xa0\\xa0 the rebellion ultimately died down.\\nStranger still, in the summer of 1607,\\xa0\\xa0 another Dmitry Ivanovich appeared, claiming he\\xa0\\nhad survived the attack on the Kremlin and then\\xa0\\xa0 started a rebellion against Vasily IV.\\xa0\\nIt was lost on no one that this man was\\xa0\\xa0 an impostor of an impostor. Yet, the new\\xa0\\nDmitry garnered support from the magnates\\xa0\\xa0 who supported the previous Dmitry, who’s\\xa0\\ncharred remains were fired from a cannon.\\xa0\\xa0 Even Marina Mniszech, the wife of the\\xa0\\nprevious impostor, confirmed that this\\xa0\\xa0 new Dmitry WAS her husband.\\nIn the ensuing turmoil,\\xa0\\xa0 Dmitry was able to gather a strong army and\\xa0\\ntook control over a large territory in Russia.\\xa0\\xa0 The Crimean Tatars and the Nogai Horde used the\\xa0\\nupheaval to ravage unprotected Russian lands,\\xa0\\xa0 which created complete chaos.\\nVasily, realizing that he was\\xa0\\xa0 in a very difficult position, in February\\xa0\\n1609 made an alliance with the Swedish King\\xa0\\xa0 Charles IX to defeat Dmitry, and in return\\xa0\\nhanded over the Korela Fortress to Sweden. \\n\\xa0 In March, the Swedish army under the\\xa0\\ncommand of General Jacob De la Gardie\\xa0\\xa0 went to the aid of the Russians. In Novgorod,\\xa0\\nit united with a part of the Russian army,\\xa0\\xa0 and headed for Moscow, which was under siege.\\n\\xa0 Seeing Sweden's interference in the\\xa0\\nRussian civil war, King Sigismund III\\xa0\\xa0 immediately prepared for the campaign, not\\xa0\\nallowing Sweden, of which he was once king,\\xa0\\xa0 to expand its influence. Since the Zebrzydowski\\xa0\\nrebellion in Poland ended at this time, Sigismund\\xa0\\xa0 rallied support of the nobles, the Catholic\\xa0\\nChurch and the Pope, and raised a strong army. \\n\\xa0 The Polish-Lithuanian host of about\\xa0\\n22,000 soldiers, under the command of\\xa0\\xa0 King Sigismund III himself, invaded Russia\\xa0\\nin September and besieged Smolensk. \\n\\xa0 The imposing fortress of Smolensk was of\\xa0\\ngreat strategic importance at this time.\\xa0\\xa0 The one who controlled it could easily break\\xa0\\nthrough towards Moscow. However, the city\\xa0\\xa0 was well fortified, and the siege dragged on.\\nOn the other hand, Sigismund's campaign negatively\\xa0\\xa0 affected Dmitry’s position, because most of the\\xa0\\nPolish troops serving under him now deserted\\xa0\\xa0 and joined the army of the Polish King. In\\xa0\\naddition, Sigismund's ambitions grew, and he no\\xa0\\xa0 longer wanted to appoint Dmitry as Tsar of Russia\\xa0\\nbut wanted the whole of Russia for himself.\\n\\xa0 Allied Russian-Swedish forces under the command\\xa0\\nof Shuisky inflicted several defeats on Dmitry and\\xa0\\xa0 then gathered a large army and set out to deal\\xa0\\nwith the greatest Russian threat - the Poles.\\n\\xa0 Learning of the movement of the Russian army,\\xa0\\nHetman Stanisław Żółkiewski led a small part\\xa0\\xa0 of the army, primarily cavalry, to intercept the enemy,\\nwhile most of the Poles remained\\xa0near Smolensk. At the end of June 1610, Żółkiewski defeated\\xa0\\na Russian vanguard of about 5,000 men\\xa0\\xa0 near Tsaryovo-Zaymishche, and then\\xa0\\nsurrounded and besieged their camp.\\xa0\\xa0 Realizing that the rest of the Russian army\\xa0\\nwas nearby, he left some of his men to watch\\xa0\\xa0 on the besieged enemy soldiers, and with\\xa0\\nthe rest he went to the Russian main army.\\n\\xa0 After a long night march, Polish soldiers appeared\\xa0\\nin front of the encamped Russian army before dawn\\xa0\\xa0 on July 4, 1610. As Russian Commander Dmitry\\xa0\\nShuisky was not even aware that the enemy was\\xa0\\xa0 in their vicinity, Stanisław Żółkiewski\\xa0\\nwanted to carry out a surprise attack,\\xa0\\xa0 but as he waited for all the soldiers\\xa0\\nfrom the long marching column to arrive,\\xa0\\xa0 such an attack was impossible to carry out.\\nDmitry Shuisky's army was deployed in two camps.\\xa0\\xa0 In one camp were the Swedish mercenaries\\xa0\\ngathered from all over Europe and numbered\\xa0\\xa0 about 3,300 soldiers. In the second camp were\\xa0\\nRussian forces numbering about 20,000 troops.\\xa0\\xa0 In addition to this, they also had 11 cannons.\\nOn the other hand, Żółkiewski had only 2,500\\xa0\\xa0 cavalry under his command, mostly winged hussars,\\xa0\\nthen 400 Cossack and 200 Polish infantry,\\xa0\\xa0 and 2 cannons. The infantry and cannons were late,\\xa0\\nand they were still far from the battlefield.\\n\\xa0 Before the battle itself, Stanisław Żółkiewski\\xa0\\nordered the surrounding villages to be burned,\\xa0\\xa0 so that enemy infantry could not use them for\\xa0\\ndefensive purposes. The fence and obstacles\\xa0\\xa0 that served to slow down the onslaught of\\xa0\\ncavalry were also partially destroyed.\\n\\xa0 Russian forces were soon also deployed, but\\xa0\\nbecause they were located between the Vdovka\\xa0\\xa0 and Gzhat rivers, they could not be spread to\\xa0\\ntake advantage of their numerical superiority.\\xa0\\xa0 Their troops took up positions behind the damaged\\xa0\\nfence. Behind the left wing of their army, was a\\xa0\\xa0 strong group of Russian soldiers, mostly composed\\xa0\\nof mobilized men, and they served as a reserve,\\xa0\\xa0 because it was not possible to\\xa0\\ndeploy them on such a terrain.\\n\\xa0 It is noticeable that Żółkiewski concentrated\\xa0\\nhis main forces on his right wing.\\n\\xa0 At about 4 o'clock in the morning polish\\xa0\\ntrumpets and drums gave the signal to the hussars\\xa0\\xa0 and marked the beginning of the battle.\\nAlexander Zborovski's heavy cavalry attacked\\xa0\\xa0 the center. At first they advanced\\xa0\\nslowly, but when they approached,\\xa0\\xa0 a fierce charge was launched towards the enemy\\xa0\\nin order to collide at the highest speed. \\n\\xa0 The first contact was disastrous for the front\\xa0\\nlines of the Russian army. Although the Polish\\xa0\\xa0 hussars could only pass through the gaps in the\\xa0\\nfence that they had partially destroyed before\\xa0\\xa0 the battle, they inflicted heavy losses\\xa0\\non the enemy. Russian battle formations\\xa0\\xa0 gradually started to disintegrate, and\\xa0\\nwere forced into a slow withdrawal.\\n\\xa0 The hussars, having lost momentum, quickly\\xa0\\nreorganized their formations, and launched\\xa0\\xa0 a new attack on the second Russian line.\\nIn response to this, the Russian cavalry\\xa0\\xa0 from the second row set out to meet them. A new\\xa0\\nbloody showdown ensued. However, the Polish riders\\xa0\\xa0 lost most of their long lances in the previous\\xa0\\ncharge, limiting the shock of their charge.\\n\\xa0 A fight with swords and sabers occurred.\\xa0\\nYet the Poles continued to advance into\\xa0\\xa0 the depths of the Russian army formation.\\xa0\\nAnd again, as they lost momentum and became\\xa0\\xa0 threatened from the flanks and rear, they\\xa0\\nwithdrew in formation to the starting positions.\\n\\xa0 During that time, the Polish left wing, under the\\xa0\\ncommand of Mikołaj Struś, had difficulties with\\xa0\\xa0 the Swedish mercenaries. Since the fence on this\\xa0\\npart of the front was only slightly destroyed,\\xa0\\xa0 the cavalry charges were less effective. Although\\xa0\\nthe Swedish mercenaries were unmotivated to fight\\xa0\\xa0 because they did not receive their salary\\xa0\\non time, their discipline, training and\\xa0\\xa0 equipment successfully matched the Poles.\\nThe Poles found themselves in a very difficult\\xa0\\xa0 position here. Enemy musketeers, protected by\\xa0\\nthe fence fired at cavalry from close range,\\xa0\\xa0 while pikemen did not allow the\\xa0\\nPoles to break through the lines.\\n\\xa0 Meanwhile, a new charge on\\xa0\\nthe Polish right wing occurred\\xa0\\xa0 with fresh Polish units. The hussars again\\xa0\\ndealt a heavy blow to the enemy's front line.\\xa0\\xa0 They began to break through the mass of Russian\\xa0\\nsoldiers, and gradually advanced north. However,\\xa0\\xa0 when they broke through, the Poles were\\xa0\\nagain left without most of their lances,\\xa0\\xa0 and the second Russian line stopped them again. \\nThreatened from the flanks, these units started to\\xa0\\xa0 retreat, while a third wave of fresh\\xa0\\nPolish hussars started to advance.\\n\\xa0 The less numerous Polish left wing could not\\xa0\\nmake similar breakthroughs. Swedish mercenary\\xa0\\xa0 pikemen and musketeers proved a solid defensive\\xa0\\ncombination, and musket fire also had an important\\xa0\\xa0 psychological effect on humans and horses.\\nAfter a long fight, the first line of\\xa0\\xa0 cavalry started retreating here as well. \\nWhen the first line successfully left the battle,\\xa0\\xa0 troops from the Polish second line of the\\xa0\\nleft wing rushed forward. Here, the Poles\\xa0\\xa0 carried out attacks by expanding their ranks, in\\xa0\\norder to be a harder target for the musketeers.\\n\\xa0 The charge was no more\\xa0\\neffective than the previous one.\\xa0\\xa0 Although the Poles tried to widen the gaps in the\\xa0\\nfences, which was a dangerous obstacle for them,\\xa0\\xa0 they were not successful. Enemy\\xa0\\nmusketeers, although inaccurate,\\xa0\\xa0 opened fire on the hussars again and again. \\nAfter a Polish horseman was left without his\\xa0\\xa0 lance, he was forced to fight with a saber, which\\xa0\\nmade the battle easier for the Swedish pikemen.\\n\\xa0 The situation on this part of the front improved\\xa0\\nwhen after the Polish infantry and two cannons\\xa0\\xa0 finally arrived on the battlefield. They opened\\xa0\\nfire from a distance, in support of the hussars.\\n\\xa0 Meanwhile, the right wing was almost completely\\xa0\\nleft without fresh units. It seemed that,\\xa0\\xa0 despite strong charges and deep breakthroughs,\\xa0\\nthey could not break the enemy formations.\\n\\xa0 Because of this, Stanisław Żółkiewski\\xa0\\ngradually sent reinforcements from the\\xa0\\xa0 army reserve to his right wing. But despite this,\\xa0\\nmost hussars were still left without their lances,\\xa0\\xa0 and were by now tired and demoralized.\\nNevertheless, the hussars continued to carry out\\xa0\\xa0 their orders, and launched a new attack on their\\xa0\\nopponent. As the front lines of the Russian left\\xa0\\xa0 wing were by now weakened by the intense fighting,\\xa0\\nthe Russian cavalry set out to meet the hussars\\xa0\\xa0 in order to slow down the Polish attack\\xa0\\nand give their comrades time to regroup.\\n\\xa0 Soon the two armies clashed and a real cavalry\\xa0\\nbattle ensued. The very beginning of the fight\\xa0\\xa0 was uncertain, but soon the skill and\\xa0\\ndiscipline of the hussars prevailed\\xa0\\xa0 and gave results. The Russians set out on a\\xa0\\ntotal retreat north, followed by Polish cavalry.\\n\\xa0 However, the Russian cavalry managed to fulfill\\xa0\\nits task and slow down the opponent, and the\\xa0\\xa0 Poles, realizing that they had lost momentum\\xa0\\nagain, retreated to their starting positions.\\n\\xa0 Shortly after this retreat, the Russian ranks\\xa0\\nspread and opened the way for a new cavalry\\xa0\\xa0 detachments that set out to attack. These were the\\xa0\\nReiter detachments, cavalry that carried firearms\\xa0\\xa0 in addition to their swords.\\nThe Polish troops, which had been\\xa0\\xa0 resting and preparing for the next attack so far,\\xa0\\nreacted quickly and set out to meet the enemy.\\n\\xa0 When the Poles came within range, the\\xa0\\nReiter detachments abruptly turned\\xa0\\xa0 and opened fire. They then wheeled about\\xa0\\nand galloped back towards their own army.\\n\\xa0 The Poles remained steadfast and continued\\xa0\\nto advance, but the second line of Reiter\\xa0\\xa0 detachments appeared in front of them\\xa0\\nand also performed the same maneuver.\\n\\xa0 This time, the hussars proved their mettle by\\xa0\\xa0 accelerating into the hail of bullets,\\xa0\\ncatching up with their opponent.\\xa0\\xa0 A new cavalry battle occurred. The clashing of\\xa0\\nsteel and the screams of men pierced the air,\\xa0\\xa0 as the highly trained Reiters and Hussars stood\\xa0\\ntoe to toe. The Polish advance slogged forward,\\xa0\\xa0 but it seemed that this was another attack\\xa0\\nthat would end with only limited success\\n\\xa0 But the stubborn Poles refused to\\xa0\\nback down and at one point the Reiter\\xa0\\xa0 detachments reached their breaking point\\xa0\\nand started fleeing towards their comrades.\\xa0\\xa0 Seeing the mass of their own cavalry and\\xa0\\nPolish horsemen rushing towards them,\\xa0\\xa0 the whole Russian left wing collapsed\\xa0\\nin panic. The first ranks began fleeing,\\xa0\\xa0 and their escape provoked a chain reaction in\\xa0\\nwhich the entire Russian left wing set out in an\\xa0\\xa0 unorganized retreat towards their camp. \\nFleeing the Polish cavalry, many were cut down,\\xa0\\xa0 while continued their retreat\\xa0\\nmuch further than the camp.\\n\\xa0 During that time, the Russian right wing was\\xa0\\nstill stable, but was soon exposed to new attacks.\\xa0\\xa0 An important role was also played by Polish\\xa0\\ninfantry, who first shot at the enemy, then\\xa0\\xa0 drew their swords and also launched a charge.\\nProbably the greatest impact on the breakdown\\xa0\\xa0 of the Russian right wing was the attack on\\xa0\\ntheir left flank, which was now fully exposed.\\xa0\\xa0 After a long battle, it was clear that\\xa0\\nthe Swedish mercenaries could not win\\xa0\\xa0 and they started to retreat. \\nUnlike the left wing, the Russian\\xa0\\xa0 right wing withdrew in an organized manner, and\\xa0\\nhere some of the Reiter units played a major role\\xa0\\xa0 covering the retreat of the infantry.\\nAfter more than three hours of heavy fighting,\\xa0\\xa0 the Battle of Klushino ended. Although Stanisław\\xa0\\nŻółkiewski managed to defeat his more numerous\\xa0\\xa0 opponent, two enemy camps full of soldiers\\xa0\\nposed a major threat. However, Żółkiewski\\xa0\\xa0 offered the mercenaries to side with him, and\\xa0\\na good deal of them did, probably disappointed\\xa0\\xa0 because they did not receive their payment\\xa0\\non time from the Russians. Those who refused\\xa0\\xa0 to accept this offer were permitted to leave\\xa0\\nthe camp peacefully and head back to Sweden.\\n\\xa0 Dmitry Shuisky then initiated the withdrawal\\xa0\\nof the remainder of the Russian army. The\\xa0\\xa0 Poles took advantage of this and rushed towards\\xa0\\nhis camp, to plunder it as soon as possible.\\n\\xa0 After the battle the Russian soldiers, surrounded\\xa0\\nnear Tsaryovo-Zaymishche, heard about defeat of\\xa0\\xa0 their army and decided to surrender, with\\xa0\\nsome of them joining the Polish army. \\n\\xa0 Reinforced by additional troops, Żółkiewski\\xa0\\ncontinued with his army to the east\\xa0\\xa0 and soon entered the Russian capital of Moscow\\xa0\\non October 8, 1610. He captured the Russian Tsar\\xa0\\xa0 Vasily Shuisky, as well as the defeated\\xa0\\ncommander Dmitry Shuisky. This marked\\xa0\\xa0 the beginning of the Polish occupation of the\\xa0\\nRussian capital, which lasted for two years.\",\n",
       " \"Among the general population, there is the will to restore our ecosystems. Protection is not enough, we need restoration. Rivers in Europe are in bad shape. Sometimes we, human beings, destroyed them so badly, that leaving nature alone is not good enough. That it needs restoration. A river that flows through low-lands,\\nusually has an huge dynamic. It creates curves,\\nit changes its course. For hundreds of years, \\nwe have tied our rivers to dykes.  Now the rivers can \\nno longer expand naturally. Here we constructed a series of nature-like \\ngravel and stone structures that act like rapids. They do not stop the water, like a weir would, \\nbut simply slow down the flow. So the water rises above the level of these\\nstructures, and only then flows downward freely. This adds oxygen to the water \\nand also cools it down. because the water scatters against the stones, \\nwhich are part of this construction, this sequence. Through these local changes,\\nthe water is oxygenated and purified. The higher level of these structures also means\\nthat more water stays upstream, rather than flowing off quickly. Suddenly we've got whirlpools and rapids,\\nwhich bring oxygen into the water. Plants start to root themselves in the\\ncalmer sections of water. There's faster access \\nfor migrating fish species to build nesting grounds in the \\nre-created rock and gravel structures. So we create biodiversity in small steps,\\nand when rewilding works well, this sets in motion a process \\nby which the river restores itself. We have a situation where we have\\nmore and more problems with drought, and after every rain we have flooding. This is the result of \\nmistakes made in the past. The resilience of our environment \\nto the effects of climate change is going down. This is very much\\nthe wrong way. When an ecosystem is restored,\\nwhen it regains it's original function, when it looks as beautiful as it does here,\\nit's also such an opportunity for the region. If you have a regenerated river,\\nof course it's good for the river, of course it's good for the\\nanimals living by the river, It helps us have cleaner\\nwater, less floods. But it's also very good for the people living\\naround it because they can make a living. They can have tourism, \\nnice restaurants, lodges, Biking, canoeing, ... It really can generate \\na source of income for regions that are usually quite\\ndeprived of traditional industry. Without nature,\\nthere's no food. Without nature,\\nthere's no farming.

       " 'Visting Krakow and looking for inspiration\\nfor places to visit? Here are three things you shouldn\\'t miss! Some consider Krakow Poland\\'s unofficial capital! And much of it has UNESCO \\nWorld Heritage status! Plus: almost a quarter of its 800,000 inhabitants\\nare students, making Krakow a very colorful and vibrant place. There are over 200 cafes in the city. 40 museums. And 125 art galleries. Krakow\\'s huge market square, dating back to\\nthe 13th century, is an absolute must-see for any visitor! Spanning 40.000 square meters, it\\'s one the\\nlargest medieval town squares in Europe. Take a stroll and soak up the fantastic atmosphere! And definitely stop by the Renaissance-era\\ncloth hall dating back to the 16th century. You\\'ll find plenty of great souvenirs on the\\nground floor. It\\'s upper floor houses Poland\\'s National\\nMuseum, which showcases masterworks of  Polish art from the 19th century. From April to October, you can also visit\\nthe tower of St. Mary\\'s Church to watch Krakow\\'s famous trumpeter play the so-called \"Hejnal\"\\nevery hour on the hour. The bugle call has a historic origin dating\\nback centuries. Wondering what Krawkow specialty to sample? Definitely go for filled dumplings, \\nknown as pierogi. You can find them almost everywhere. We recommend going to Krawkow\\'s trendy \"Kazimierz\" district, where you\\'ll find  plenty of authentic Polish cuisine. It takes about 15 minutes to walk there from\\nthe city center. \"Starka\" restaurant serves excellent pierogi  – \\nRysia and Halina have been making them for over 10 years! To make the dumplings, dough is rolled out\\nand then carefully wrapped around various different fillings. One serving costs 6 to 7 euro. Pierogi are Poland\\'s national dish. Sightseeing done, belly filled …now what? Go see Oskar Schindler\\'s enamel factory \\nanother must-see! The museum is always busy, \\nso book your tickets in advance. Entrepreneur Oskar Schindler saved about 1,200\\nJews from the Nazi death camps by employing them here, at his factory. The story is told in Steven Spielberg\\'s film\\nSchindlers List. The exhibition paints a detailed picture of\\nKrakow during the Nazi occupation, and shows that although Oskar Schindler saved many lives,\\nhe remains an ambivalent figure. First of all he was a member of the Nazi party. Then, when he came to Krakow he was running\\na business taking Jewish property to get his personal advantages. But still he could abandoned these people\\nand he did all his best to save their lives. Finally, for a panoramic view over Krakow,\\nhead to \"Krakus\" hill, about three kilometers south of the city center. For more videos like this, subscribe to our\\nYouTube channel.',\n",

       " 'Poland’s infantry are a peculiar case of\\xa0\\nextremes. As a former satellite state of\\xa0\\xa0 the Soviet Union, its roots\\xa0\\nare in Warsaw Pact equipment,\\xa0\\xa0 and they weren’t operating the best the Eastern\\xa0\\nBloc had to offer by its collapse in 1989. But on the other hand, Poland has been a member\\xa0\\xa0 of NATO since 1999. Upgraded Leopard\\xa0\\n2PLs ride alongside ancient BMP-1s;\\xa0\\xa0 and new heavy equipment built on western\\xa0\\ndesign principles is around the corner. Today I’m breaking down Poland’s mechanized and\\xa0\\nmotorized infantry units from squad to division,\\xa0\\xa0 covering current and new equipment, and\\xa0\\ntheir plans for an ambitious expansion. First, there are two main types of armored\\xa0\\ninfantry squad: mechanized and motorized. The Mechanized Squad is currently mounted\\xa0\\non the BWP-1 infantry fighting vehicle,\\xa0\\xa0 the Polish designation for the Soviet BMP-1\\xa0\\nfirst introduced in the 1960s. Its main armament\\xa0\\xa0 is a 73mm Grom low-pressure smoothbore gun,\\xa0\\nwhich fires the same munitions as the SPG-9\\xa0\\xa0 recoilless gun. It also has a coaxial PKT\\xa0\\nmachine gun and Malyutka anti-tank missiles.\\xa0\\xa0 The BMP-1 can hold a max of 3 crew members, and\\xa0\\n8 in the passenger compartment. Although this\\xa0\\xa0 doesn’t directly translate to 3 plus 8 squads to\\xa0\\naccommodate Platoon HQ personnel. The BMP-1 also\\xa0\\xa0 only has a 1-man turret, so the vehicle commander\\xa0\\n- sat behind the driver - usually dismounts. This platform’s obsolescence is fairly\\xa0\\nobvious. Much like East Germany,\\xa0\\xa0 Poland only received a few BMP-2s before the\\xa0\\nfall of communism, which were sold off after\\xa0\\xa0 about a decade. Since then, Poland has failed\\xa0\\nto field a modernized version of the BMP-1,\\xa0\\xa0 which it attempted to do with the Puma program\\xa0\\nin the 2000s. The BMP-1’s hopeful successor is\\xa0\\xa0 the Borsuk or Badger, which is anticipated\\xa0\\nto finish qualification trials some time in\\xa0\\xa0 mid-2023 and be issued to the 16th Mechanized\\xa0\\nDivision alongside K2 main battle tanks. As for the squad itself, they usually have\\xa0\\neight personnel. They’re split into a dismounted\\xa0\\xa0 infantry element, called a Fire Team, and a\\xa0\\nvehicle crew. The Squad Leader is also the\\xa0\\xa0 leader of the Fire Team, and on the dismount they\\xa0\\npass command of the vehicle to the Crew Leader,\\xa0\\xa0 who also acts as a Gunner-Operator on the\\xa0\\nBMP. Doctrinally, both are meant to be NCOs. The crew further consists of\\xa0\\na Driver, and the most common\\xa0\\xa0 weapon for BMP crews is the mini-Beryl — a\\xa0\\nsub-carbine variant of Poland’s modernized\\xa0\\xa0 AK chambered in 5.56 NATO. The Squad\\xa0\\nLeader has the larger rifle variant. The dismounted element also has\\xa0\\na machine gunner armed with a\\xa0\\xa0 UKM-2000P — essentially a PKM converted\\xa0\\nto fire 7.62 NATO — an assistant machine\\xa0\\xa0 gunner, an RPG-7 gunner and their\\xa0\\nassistant gunner, and a rifleman. It’s possible that the Rifleman is doctrinally\\xa0\\nmeant to carry a GPBO-40 underbarrel grenade\\xa0\\xa0 launcher. But based on my conversations with\\xa0\\nPolish servicemembers and after combing through\\xa0\\xa0 photos of Polish exercises, it seems\\xa0\\nto be inconsistent or unit dependent. The Poles also haven’t adopted a grenade launcher\\xa0\\nfor the MSBS Grot yet. So units like the 7th\\xa0\\xa0 Coastal Defense Brigade that have started the\\xa0\\ntransition are empty handed in that regard. In addition to these previous gen weapons,\\xa0\\nthe Polish are gradually transitioning to\\xa0\\xa0 new or upgraded weapons. The most famous is\\xa0\\nthe MSBS Grot, which is replacing the Beryl,\\xa0\\xa0 although it currently doesn’t have a sub-carbine\\xa0\\nvariant or adopted grenade launcher. Additionally,\\xa0\\xa0 the UKM-2000P is getting modifications\\xa0\\nthat include a new stock and a picatinny\\xa0\\xa0 rail for mounting optics. The most common\\xa0\\nof which is the Eotech holographic sight. Further, there is talk that the RPG-7\\xa0\\nwill eventually be replaced by the M72\\xa0\\xa0 EC Mk.1. Although since the M72 is a single\\xa0\\nmunition, and the RPG-7 is a reusable system,\\xa0\\xa0 it is questionable whether they’ll be able\\xa0\\nto fully phase out the RPG-7 anytime soon\\xa0\\xa0 or if the weapons allocation will be changed up.\\xa0\\nLike spreading out multiple M72s across a squad. Three of these squads make up the core of a\\xa0\\nplatoon. They’re accompanied by a Support Squad,\\xa0\\xa0 which is commanded by the Assistant Platoon Leader\\xa0\\xa0 typically ranking Junior Warrant\\xa0\\nOfficer. The squad has 8 personnel,\\xa0\\xa0 and serves an LM-60 60mm mortar and a GSBO-40\\xa0\\nstandalone grenade launcher, plus a Combat Medic. Meanwhile, in 1st Squad’s vehicle, the\\xa0\\nPlatoon Leader acts as vehicle commander\\xa0\\xa0 and also has a Radio Operator to\\xa0\\naccompany them on the dismount. Three platoons form the close combat\\xa0\\nelement of the mechanized or motorized\\xa0\\xa0 company. Company leadership, including\\xa0\\nthe company commander and their deputy,\\xa0\\xa0 ride in their own individual combat\\xa0\\nvehicles with 10 people between them. The Company Chief, equivalent to a first\\xa0\\nsergeant or company sergeant major,\\xa0\\xa0 leads the 6-man logistics team. They set\\xa0\\nup company logistics resupply points,\\xa0\\xa0 like for ammo, fuel and water, and\\xa0\\nare equipped with two off-road trucks. The Company Technician meanwhile leads\\xa0\\nan armored recovery squad, tasked with\\xa0\\xa0 recovering stuck vehicles and performing\\xa0\\nlimited maintenance work. In BMP units,\\xa0\\xa0 they’re doctrinally meant to have an armored\\xa0\\nrecovery variant of the MT-LB called the WPT,\\xa0\\xa0 while motorized units are meant to have the\\xa0\\ntechnical reconnaissance variant of the Rosomak. Motorized Infantry Platoons are similar.\\xa0\\nAlthough equipped with the wheeled KTO Rosomak,\\xa0\\xa0 armed with a 30mm autocannon and the option for\\xa0\\nSPIKE missiles. They ironically have a superior\\xa0\\xa0 IFV in almost every way to the mechanized troops.\\xa0\\nHowever, doctrinally, their squads lose the last\\xa0\\xa0 rifleman and instead have a dedicated vehicle\\xa0\\ncommander in addition to the gunner. This is\\xa0\\xa0 enabled by the Rosomak’s 2-man turret, and is a\\xa0\\ndeparture from the old Soviet way of IFV crewing.\\xa0\\xa0 One assumes that when the Borsuk replaces\\xa0\\nthe BMP-1, they’ll adopt a similar approach. Additionally at the platoon-level, the\\xa0\\nSupport Squad serves a tripod-mounted Mk\\xa0\\xa0 19 automatic grenade launcher rather than\\xa0\\nthe stand-alone single-shot launcher. But\\xa0\\xa0 otherwise they doctrinally still\\xa0\\nhave a 60mm mortar and medic. Four companies form the core\\xa0\\nof an infantry battalion,\\xa0\\xa0 led and supported by a Command Company that\\xa0\\nincludes command and logistics elements,\\xa0\\xa0 traffic control, a recon platoon and a sniper\\xa0\\nsquad with 4x .50 caliber sniper rifles. Battalions include a Support Company,\\xa0\\nwhose 2 mortar platoons ideally provide\\xa0\\xa0 the battalion with a total of 8x M120\\xa0\\nRak 120mm self-propelled mortars,\\xa0\\xa0 and whose anti-tank platoon provides\\xa0\\n6 SPIKE anti-tank guided missiles. They further have a Logistics Company,\\xa0\\xa0 providing supply and maintenance\\xa0\\nsupport, plus a medical section. In total, each battalion would ideally have 56\\xa0\\nBMPs or Rosomaks and in the area of 760 soldiers,\\xa0\\xa0 although during wartime mass mobilization might\\xa0\\nsee the filling out of understrength units. But at the brigade-level there is more variation.\\xa0\\nEach brigade generally had 3 maneuver battalions\\xa0\\xa0 before 2022. Armored Cavalry Brigades and\\xa0\\nArmored Brigades, which are tank heavy, had\\xa0\\xa0 2 tank battalions and 1 mechanized battalion on\\xa0\\nBMP-1, while depending on the context, mechanized\\xa0\\xa0 brigades could 2 mechanized and 1 tank battalion,\\xa0\\nor 3 mechanized or motorized battalions, or more. However, there is a plan to bring brigades to\\xa0\\na 4 battalion standard and some brigades have\\xa0\\xa0 already made the transition. Based on comments\\xa0\\nmade by the Polish defense ministry in the past,\\xa0\\xa0 this could mean 4 motorized battalions for lighter\\xa0\\xa0 brigades and 2 tank and 2 mechanized\\xa0\\ninfantry battalions for heavier brigades. But regardless, brigades are supported by\\xa0\\na Self-Propelled Artillery Battalion, like\\xa0\\xa0 in other countries to the east literally called a\\xa0\\n“division”. Their three batteries each serve eight\\xa0\\xa0 2S1 122mm SPGs, for a total of 24 tubes in the\\xa0\\nbattalion. Mechanized Brigades with mainly wheeled\\xa0\\xa0 Rosomak battalions, like the 17th Mechanized\\xa0\\nBrigade, have Dana 152mm wheeled SPGs in lieu. And then there’s an Air Defense Battalion,\\xa0\\xa0 with a minimum of 24 Grom man-portable\\xa0\\nair defense systems or MANPADS.\\xa0\\xa0 Armored brigades also have 12 Biała self-propelled\\xa0\\nanti-aircraft guns, while mechanized brigades\\xa0\\xa0 have 24 truck-mounted combo systems that\\xa0\\ninclude 23mm cannons and Grom AA missiles. Rounding it out, brigades\\xa0\\nhave a reconnaissance company,\\xa0\\xa0 engineer battalion and logistics battalion. At the highest level, three maneuver brigades\\xa0\\ngenerally make-up a division, although in the\\xa0\\xa0 future it is planned for divisions to be based on\\xa0\\n4 maneuver brigades of 4 maneuver battalions each. Poland’s four maneuver divisions were its\\xa0\\nlargest tactical units before 2023. The\\xa0\\xa0 11th Armoured Cavalry Division in the southwest,\\xa0\\nthe 12th Mechanised Division in the northwest,\\xa0\\xa0 the 16th Mechanized Division in the\\xa0\\nnortheast near the border with Kaliningrad,\\xa0\\xa0 and the 18th Mechanized Division in the\\xa0\\neast and southeast. The 18th Mechanized\\xa0\\xa0 was the newest division, formed in 2018\\xa0\\nto fill the gap left by the disbandment\\xa0\\xa0 of the 1st Mechanized in 2011. It just\\xa0\\nreached operational capability in 2021,\\xa0\\xa0 so its units are underdeveloped. In response to\\xa0\\nthe ongoing conflict, Poland announced its plan\\xa0\\xa0 to form two new divisions as well. One will be the\\xa0\\n1st Legions Infantry Division in the northeast,\\xa0\\xa0 partially formed from units of the 16th Division.\\xa0\\nIt will cover the area between the 16th and 18th. In the future, the goal is for the 18th Mechanized\\xa0\\nto operate the M1A2 Abrams and the 16th Mechanized\\xa0\\xa0 to operate the K2PL. The 16th Mechanized\\xa0\\ncurrently operates PT-91 Twardy battalions,\\xa0\\xa0 which are likely subjects of weapons transfer in\\xa0\\nthe future. The 1st Legions Infantry meanwhile\\xa0\\xa0 will operate a mix of K2s and Abrams, while the\\xa0\\nLeopard 2A5s that were in the 18th Mechanized\\xa0\\xa0 will be shifted to the 11th Armored Cavalry\\xa0\\nDivision near the border with Germany. This\\xa0\\xa0 division already operates Leopard 2PLs and Leopard\\xa0\\n2A4s waiting to be upgraded to the 2PL standard. I should mention that in my Polish\\xa0\\ntank video I made a while back,\\xa0\\xa0 I erroneously stated that the\\xa0\\n12th Mechanized Division had\\xa0\\xa0 a PT-91 battalion. They actually had a\\xa0\\nbattalion of T-72M1Rs, which are now gone. Polish maneuver brigades are currently\\xa0\\nsupported by a divisional Artillery\\xa0\\xa0 Regiment. Artillery Regiments generally have 4\\xa0\\nartillery battalions, sporting a mix of 152mm\\xa0\\xa0 howitzers like the Dana and or 155mm like the\\xa0\\nKrab, as well as rocket artillery battalions. Also in the division is an Anti-Aircraft\\xa0\\nRegiment, featuring Osa, Kub and more\\xa0\\xa0 Grom surface-to-air missiles; as well as a\\xa0\\nLogistics Regiment and Command Battalion. Before closing out I just want to thank\\xa0\\nmy Patrons. My videos haven’t been doing\\xa0\\xa0 too hot recently and Patreon gives me an\\xa0\\nadded layer of financial stability. And\\xa0\\xa0 now that you have an idea of Poland’s infantry\\xa0\\nunits, check out this earlier video where we\\xa0\\xa0 cover Poland’s tank unit structure from the\\xa0\\nplatoon to brigade. We’ll see you over there.',\n",

       " \"In this video series I analyze how different\\ncountries would look like in their greater version today. Don't take it too seriously, it's just a thought\\nexperiment using a lot of imagination. In the last video we analyzed Greater Luxembourg\\n- but also the country of Poland is not spared from our thought experiment. Therefore, we’ll transform Poland from Europe's\\nninth largest country into a great empire, which its neighboring countries should rather\\nnot mess with. Greater Poland is also the name of an administrative\\nregion of Poland - but this video is not about this region, but instead about a larger version\\nof Poland. Poland experienced a vivid history during\\nthe last centuries, marked by times of maximum expansion to times when it didn't even exist. But today marks the end of that - because\\ntoday we give Poland the greatness it deserves. Therefore, we take a look at the history book\\nand use the republic of Poland-Lithuania as a starting point. The multi-ethnic state had the largest extension\\nin 1619 and although Poland did not control all parts directly, we want to think big in\\nthis video and put the entire territory under Polish sovereignty. Taking a look at the maps allows us to grasp\\nthe full dimensions of Greater Poland. It stretches from Estonia through the remaining\\nBaltic States, Belarus, today's Poland, Russia and Ukraine, thus controlling almost 1,000,000\\nsquare kilometers of land, more than 3 times larger than present-day Poland. Likewise, about 80 million people now call\\nGreater Poland their home, more than double that today. Thus, Greater Poland has risen from the ninth\\nlargest country in Europe to Europe's second largest country - behind the european part\\nof russia - and has moved up from 9th place within Europe by population to 4th place. Furthermore, it now controls not only large\\nareas of fertile Ukrainian black soil, but also virtually all overland trade between\\nRussia and the rest of Europe. Access to the Black Sea is narrowly denied\\nto Greater Poland, but it has a long coastline to the Baltic Sea. Also, coal reserves in western Russia now\\nfall under Greater Polands territory, as well as gas, coal and oil reserves in Ukraine. We have thus transformed Poland into one of\\nthe biggest players on the stage of Europe’s super powers. A fact worth knowing is that Poland-Lithuania\\nwas unique in Europe in terms of confessional diversity. The spectrum of religions ranged from Judaism\\nto Protestantism, Catholicism, Orthodoxy and Islam, all of which coexisted peacefully and,\\ndespite the dominance of Catholicism, enjoyed politically supported religious freedom - and\\nthis in times when conflicts caused by religion were very common. Another interesting fact is that Poland-Lithuania\\nhad an impressive army, which was also essential for the defense of the vast territories of\\nthe country. The Winged Hussars were feared throughout\\nEurope for their speed, effectiveness, and yes, for those artistic wings. You should rather avoid them if your life\\nis important to you. But even they could not stop the partitioning\\nof Poland in the late 18th century.\",\n",
       " \"In the Polish campaign the\\xa0\\nGerman forces were stronger,\\xa0\\xa0 but they did not have an overwhelming\\xa0\\nnumerical superiority over the Poles,\\xa0\\xa0 so why did it take the Germans only more\\xa0\\nthan a month to completely defeat Poland?\\xa0\\xa0 The Germans had two key advantages: their army was\\xa0\\nlarger and had better equipment than Polish forces\\xa0\\xa0 and also the Germans possessed tanks, which would\\xa0\\ngive them greater punch and much faster movement.\\xa0\\xa0 Poland used two strategies to counter the\\xa0\\nGerman advantages. The Poles had made an\\xa0\\xa0 alliance with Britain and France so that they\\xa0\\ncould put pressure on Germany from the West.\\xa0\\xa0 In this way Germany would have to keep a large\\xa0\\npart of their forces there and could not deploy\\xa0\\xa0 a strong force against Poland. In order to\\xa0\\ncounter Germany's superior offensive capabilities,\\xa0\\xa0 such as tanks, Poland had adopted another\\xa0\\nstrategy. It had created two defensive lines.\\xa0\\xa0 The main line was behind the Vistula river\\xa0\\nand its tributaries and they could retreat\\xa0\\xa0 to a shorter line on the Romanian bridgehead, if\\xa0\\nthings went badly. But there was a problem. Poland\\xa0\\xa0 could not start the war with all of its forces\\xa0\\ndeployed behind its defences. Otherwise there\\xa0\\xa0 was a chance that Germany could capture part of\\xa0\\nthe Polish territory without fighting and Britain\\xa0\\xa0 and France would not declare war on Germany. So\\xa0\\nPoland deployed its forces forward to the border\\xa0\\xa0 to receive the German attack and make Britain\\xa0\\nand France declare war on Germany. After that\\xa0\\xa0 they would have to make a difficult retreat\\xa0\\nunder German pressure to their main defences. On\\xa0\\xa0 September 1st 1939 the Germans launched the attack\\xa0\\nalong the whole front. The Poles had established\\xa0\\xa0 an intermediary defensive line, where they planned\\xa0\\nto halt the initial German advance. In the North\\xa0\\xa0 the Germans encircled some of the Polish units and\\xa0\\nreestablished land connection with East Prussia.\\xa0\\xa0 In the South the Germans reached the\\xa0\\nSouthernmost part of the Polish defensive line.\\xa0\\xa0 They then launched several tank attacks against\\xa0\\nit. In the South and Center the Poles were able to\\xa0\\xa0 contain the Germans, but in the North the Polish\\xa0\\nlines were broken. The Poles had their reserves\\xa0\\xa0 ready to cover the Northern direction. They also\\xa0\\npulled back their forces in the South. Soon the\\xa0\\xa0 reatereting forces ran into trouble, as they were\\xa0\\npursued by fast moving German tanks. In the North\\xa0\\xa0 the Polish reserves reestablished the front line\\xa0\\nand for some days could continue the withdrawal.\\xa0\\xa0 But then the German tanks broke through once\\xa0\\nagain. This time the Poles did not have any\\xa0\\xa0 reserves to send against them. By that time Poland\\xa0\\nmight have benefitted from a French attack on the\\xa0\\xa0 Western front, but the Allies had not expected the\\xa0\\nevents to take place so quickly and did not give\\xa0\\xa0 effective assistance to Poland. Polish forces\\xa0\\ndecided to launch a desperate counterattack\\xa0\\xa0 against the German forward units to allow their\\xa0\\nforces to escape. However, most of the Polish\\xa0\\xa0 units were too disorganized to counterattack and\\xa0\\nin the South their forces were encircled. The\\xa0\\xa0 Polish counterattack in the North allowed some of\\xa0\\nthe Polish forces to withdraw to the Warsaw area,\\xa0\\xa0 but soon the Germans turned their attention\\xa0\\ntowards the counterattacking force and cut it off.\\xa0\\xa0 The Germans succeeded in their plan to cut off\\xa0\\nmost of the Polish forces before they could reach\\xa0\\xa0 their main defenses. By that time they had already\\xa0\\nbreached the Polish defenses from the North.\\xa0\\xa0 Ten days earlier the Germans had reached the\\xa0\\nPolish main defensive line from the North.\\xa0\\xa0 The Poles misjudged the situation and their troops\\xa0\\nwere out of position, which allowed the Germans to\\xa0\\xa0 find a weak spot in the Polish defences and cross\\xa0\\nthe river. The Poles attempted to make a stand\\xa0\\xa0 behind another river line, but the Germans used\\xa0\\nmomentum to cross it before the Poles had readied\\xa0\\xa0 their defences. The main Polish defensive\\xa0\\nline was now breached from the North. The\\xa0\\xa0 Polish forces were now ordered to retreat to their\\xa0\\nfinal defensive line at the Romanian bridgehead.\\xa0\\xa0 Part of them ignored the order and remained to\\xa0\\ndefend Warsaw. During that time the Polish units\\xa0\\xa0 in the South had been falling back. The Poles\\xa0\\nwere not able to hold a solid front and the faster\\xa0\\xa0 moving German units bypassed them and crossed the\\xa0\\nmain Polish defensive line with little opposition.\\xa0\\xa0 They now moved to capture the center of the\\xa0\\nPolish resistance at Lwow. The Germans were\\xa0\\xa0 unable to take Lwow, but they cut off the Polish\\xa0\\nunits that attempted to fall back to the town.\\xa0\\xa0 The Germans were now in position to\\xa0\\nprevent the rest of the Polish army\\xa0\\xa0 from reaching the Romanian bridgehead. The\\xa0\\nnext Polish forces approached from the West.\\xa0\\xa0 The Germans moved in from several directions\\xa0\\nand cut the Poles off from all sides.\\xa0\\xa0 After the Poles could not break through the German\\xa0\\ndefences, they surrendered. The Germans were not\\xa0\\xa0 in a good position to easily destroy the Polish\\xa0\\nforces coming from the North. But by that time the\\xa0\\xa0 Soviet Union had joined the conflict and attacked\\xa0\\nthe undefended Polish border from the East. The\\xa0\\xa0 Red Army quickly advanced and cut off the retreat\\xa0\\npath South for the Polish forces. The Poles had\\xa0\\xa0 no choice but to break through the Soviet or\\xa0\\nGerman lines to escape to the South. They chose\\xa0\\xa0 to attack the Germans, but they were unable to\\xa0\\nbreak through and surrendered. With that most\\xa0\\xa0 of the largest formations of the Polish army had\\xa0\\nbeen destroyed. Without any help from the outside,\\xa0\\xa0 the Polish defenders in Warsaw surrendered to\\xa0\\nthe Germans. By early October the Soviets and\\xa0\\xa0 the Germans had finished mopping up the remaining\\xa0\\nPolish forces and the campaign was over. So,\\xa0\\xa0 why was Poland defeated only in a month? You\\xa0\\ncan see from the campaign that the reasons the\\xa0\\xa0 Poles hoped to win the war did not come into play.\\xa0\\nPoland gave up its defensive positions in order to\\xa0\\xa0 be sure to get the help from Britain and France.\\xa0\\nBut no one expected the Germans to advance so fast\\xa0\\xa0 and Britain and France were not ready to give\\xa0\\nPoland significant aid so early. So Poland could\\xa0\\xa0 not utilize the foreign aid nor its defensive\\xa0\\nadvantages. Meanwhile the Germans could make full\\xa0\\xa0 use of their stronger army and tank formations\\xa0\\nand this resulted in a quick Polish defeat.\\xa0\\xa0 It is time to pay respects to the E company for\\xa0\\nits contribution to the coverage of the Polish\\xa0\\xa0 campaign. You may want to join its ranks,\\xa0\\nas in the next episode, we will continue\\xa0\\xa0 on our way East to look at a long, but often\\xa0\\noverlooked conflict between two great powers.\",\n",
       " 'I hope you will do better. We showed you a musical trip this time. - Is there more Chopin? / - No. The second half in Poland will be a historical trip. You may think history is boring at first but it\\'s fun if you go there and experience it yourself. - Of course. / - The musical trip was enjoyable. And I can\\'t wait to watch the historical trip now. We give you... - The second half of Poland. / - Okay. It\\'s the second day in Warsaw. (Good morning) It\\'s great to be on a trip with my good friend and relax in the park. That looks nice. It looks like they\\'re shooting a commercial. That\\'s right. Do you carry your personal lightings? Is there a reflector below? I admit they are beautiful. I really wanted to come to Europe but now that I\\'m here, it doesn\\'t seem real. Though it\\'s a weekday, people don\\'t seem to be bustling around. Did you just drink coffee and eat bread since it\\'s morning? We had a musical trip yesterday. It will be a historical trip today. We\\'d like to visit places other than Warsaw too. Are there any places you\\'d like to recommend? Yes, there is one. It\\'s Krakow. - Krakow? / - Krakow. - Krakow. / - Krakow is... The old capital of Poland. The history of Poland is mostly there. So there are a lot of things to see and eat. - What is that? / - What is it? - It\\'s like Gyeongju in Korea? / - It\\'s a historical city. The hot-air balloons will be impressive. - Did they ride it? / - That looks amazing. - That\\'ll be amazing. / - It will be. (Soboru Tour\\'s historical trip) Shall we go take a train? - Great. / - Let\\'s go. (A train to Krakow) How long does it take by train? Two hours. Two hours? The train is arriving. It looks like KTX. It does. It\\'s a high-speed train. It\\'s an express train and a little more expensive. It costs $80 for a round trip. It\\'s as far as Busan. $80 for a round trip? - A bit more than 2 hours. / - 2 hours 40 minutes? We\\'re moving now. This is amazing. I\\'m riding a train in Europe. Since I\\'m riding a train in Europe, it reminds me of \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\" - You too? / - Right. I heard a snack cart will be here in a while. And we can have water, coffee and tea for free. - It\\'s included in the ticket. / - No need to spend. - Almost everything is free. / - You paid for the toilet. We didn\\'t have to. It was all free. I\\'ll ask for water later. (In a moment) It\\'s coming. They are not all free, right? - They are all free. / - They are. You can just take one out? Yes. They give it to you for free. - Too late. / - That\\'s why it\\'s free. It\\'s too fast. You can\\'t catch it. - If you can catch it, it\\'s free. / - Right. - If you stop it, you have to pay? / - Exactly. (The snack cart is gone with the wind) (I have to drink free water in Europe) (Soeun passes out frowning) - She looks serious. / - She\\'s frowning. Maybe because she couldn\\'t drink the water. Do I look okay on screen? This is a train trip in Poland with Boah. Ta-da. - It\\'s gorgeous. / - How beautiful. - What a beautiful sight. / - Look at the clouds. - Water is here. / - Water. - Grab a bottle. / - Nice timing. Water is here. (Goal achieved) After a two-hour ride from Warsaw, we arrived in Krakow. It only took two hours. - It did. / - It doesn\\'t take long. It was the capital in the past. Right. It\\'s not crowded and it looks so nice. And the outdoor cafes are gorgeous. They can be called as pioneers because... - Poland is not introduced a lot. / - Right. I think it\\'s the first time to be introduced in detail. Tell me about it. Don\\'t those kinds of squares look so good? - So beautiful. / - Squares in Europe are beautiful. The square is very big. Gosh. Look at that. I saw it from a distance and it was so beautiful. Look at that. It\\'s amazing. It\\'s so tall. The buildings are so elaborate. They look so antique. Now that we\\'re here, let\\'s try pizza bread that is famous in Krakow. Bread? Did you know we didn\\'t have lunch? - I know. Let\\'s eat it. / - Frankly, I\\'m hungry now. - Please eat something. / - Let\\'s go immediately. We should start with eating. Pizza bread is here. It smells so good. It\\'s the smell of pizza bread. (This Poland pizza bakery opened in 1980) (Apple juice is a must) They make it fresh. - It\\'s fresh fruit juice. / - No ingredients are added. They only put in apples. - They just squeeze it. / - They grind the peels too. (How does it taste?) It\\'s good. Two apples are in here. There were only 3 or 4 apples and nothing else. - How expensive is it? / - It\\'s only $1.80? - The prices are so low. / - Just $1.80... For freshly squeezed juice? The pizza bread seems so delicious. (Pizza bread is a must as well) (Zapiekanka is a light Polish snack) (With onion, cheese and mushrooms on a baguette) (It\\'s so good that it makes you dance) Do you know funghi pizza? It tastes like that. I like it because the baguette is not too thick. It\\'s crispier than I thought. Baguettes are usually hard. This is a baguette, right? Yes, it\\'s a baguette. It\\'s good. It\\'s so delicious. Now... I would have eaten at least two if I had been there. Shall we take a look around now? That\\'s Main Market Square, the biggest medieval square left in Europe. There are a lot of flowers here. They are beautiful. It\\'s strange when girls walk around holding hands. One is a manly trip and the other is a girly trip. - Indeed. / - See? I told you, shopping is better than Chopin. Awesome. Can I try it on? How do I look? I look like a maid of honor, don\\'t I? - It looks good on you. / - Does it? (Similar flower hairbands but so different) Who was that? - It was you. / - Was it? It\\'s pretty. Hello. Look at them. Look at the carriages. Looking around this square and Wawel Royal Castle, riding a carriage is a tourist attraction in here. I heard tourists always ride this carriage. What do you think? We should ride it. Sure. - They match your outfit perfectly. / - They are cute. I feel like I\\'m getting married or something. Hi. (Welcome) The black horses look cool. They look like princesses. I really like this. Hello. This is a rare experience. When will we ever ride on a carriage like this? I feel like an aristocrat. - Your outfit and garland fits too. / - You\\'re right. - Where is this place? / - This place is so nice. - This is fun. / - It is. It\\'s even fast. (The carriage stops) Is this subway running above the ground? - It\\'s a tram. / - Tram. - This place also has a tram. / - That\\'s also cheap. It\\'s pretty. They all have flower pots up there. They\\'re blowing bubbles. Children will like that. (Every sight is like a scene from a picture) This is Soeun\\'s first time to Europe. - It\\'s more thrilling for her. / - I completely fell in love. It\\'s perfect to go with your lover. - It\\'s perfect. / - Isn\\'t it perfect for a honeymoon? You can ride a carriage and the food is so cheap. This is romantic. This is what I thought Europe would be like. It\\'s so nice. It looks amazing. Soeun, look at that. What is that? Look at that. - They restored it. / - Yes, they restored it. - They restored it. / - The color of the bricks... Are all different. This also looks like it was restored. I think you\\'re right. The white brick looks restored. I think that Poland works very hard to preserve things from the past. They only repainted it. Other than that, they preserved the old style. Is this the Wawel Royal Castle? They also restored a lot of this. - The colors are different. / - The walls are different. (Krakow is a small but historic medieval city) I\\'m 29. Why is this my first time in Europe? - You were busy. / - I can only think about that. - You had to work. / - I should have traveled more. You need to go to Europe during your 20s. I started to enjoy traveling after Battle Trip. - Really? / - Whenever I have about 2 days off... - I pack up and go on a trip. / - You go on a trip? - Run. / - We\\'re already here. We\\'re here. Thank you for the ride. Let\\'s get off.',\n",
       " \"what's up you guys and welcome back to the channel\\xa0\\nwe made our way to Wrocław yesterday evening\\xa0\\xa0 so today's our very first\\xa0\\nday here exploring the city\\xa0\\xa0 we are blessed with beautiful weather\\xa0\\nas you can see so we're gonna take\\xa0\\xa0 you on the journey with us and give you\\xa0\\nour very first impressions of the city\\xa0\\xa0 so right now we're in the Rynek or the\\xa0\\nmain square of Wrocław and we made\\xa0\\xa0 our way here from Bielsko-Biała as naomi just\\xa0\\nsaid just last night so this is our very first\\xa0\\xa0 real raw first impression of Wrocław and the main\\xa0\\nmarket square or the Rynek is absolutely really\\xa0\\xa0 really beautiful as you said we have really\\xa0\\nbeautiful sunshine blue skies all around us\\xa0\\xa0 today so we couldn't be happier just to be here\\xa0\\nin this amazing city Wrocław is a very highly\\xa0\\xa0 recommendable city from a lot of different\\xa0\\npolish people we actually met a polish couple\\xa0\\xa0 that lived here while we were traveling through\\xa0\\nalbania and they said you have to come and see\\xa0\\xa0 this city it is supposedly one of the most\\xa0\\nunderrated cities when we are speaking about\\xa0\\xa0 tourist destinations in poland and we can already\\xa0\\nsee why just walking through this market square\\xa0\\xa0 so let's go and explore a little bit more of\\xa0\\nWrocław together now whenever we come to a\\xa0\\xa0 new city we typically do like to do a little\\xa0\\nbit of research ahead of time just so we know\\xa0\\xa0 what sort of city or town that we're getting into\\xa0\\nand i went on to trip advisor just last night\\xa0\\xa0 and i typed in Wrocław just to see what would\\xa0\\ncome up different recommendations different\\xa0\\xa0 things to do etc and i came across a free walking\\xa0\\ntour and i decided to click into the information\\xa0\\xa0 scroll down and it turns out that they gave\\xa0\\nall of the must-see stops along the way on\\xa0\\xa0 this specific walking tour so i basically went\\xa0\\nin copy paste brought it into the note here on my\\xa0\\xa0 iphone and what we're going to do is we're going\\xa0\\nto follow those exact notes bring us through this\\xa0\\xa0 great city it says the first thing that you\\xa0\\nhave to check out when you come to Wrocław\\xa0\\xa0 is apparently some dwarfs that sounds like a very\\xa0\\ninteresting first thing to do so that's what we're\\xa0\\xa0 gonna go and do now we're gonna try and find a\\xa0\\ncouple of these little pesky dwarfs let's go you\\xa0\\xa0 can actually type in dwarfs into the map go into\\xa0\\ngoogle maps and the very first dwarfs that came up\\xa0\\xa0 for us were handicapped dwarves and we just found\\xa0\\nthem one of them is hard of hearing one of them\\xa0\\xa0 is blind and i think one of them is sitting in\\xa0\\na wheelchair there's currently some kids there\\xa0\\xa0 but we're gonna check the handicapped dwarves\\xa0\\nout there while looking for the dwarfs as well\\xa0\\xa0 i just realized there all of the fronts of the of\\xa0\\nthe buildings here in this market square are just\\xa0\\xa0 so beautiful all of them kind of have different\\xa0\\ncolors some of them have some more no thank you\\xa0\\xa0 somebody's trying to give me a rose no thank you\\xa0\\nokay so um anyway some of them are a little bit\\xa0\\xa0 more simple but colorful and others have like\\xa0\\na lot of details going on there as well so\\xa0\\xa0 all of the housing fronts here in the market\\xa0\\nsquare are just so so stunning right here just\\xa0\\xa0 beside me is an old gothic town hall that\\xa0\\nis now currently an art museum or a museum\\xa0\\xa0 that stores a lot of Wrocław's history and it is\\xa0\\nan absolutely amazing looking building there are\\xa0\\xa0 so many different sort of sculptures outside on\\xa0\\nthe structure of the building itself and the color\\xa0\\xa0 of it is very very interesting it's kind of like\\xa0\\nan off shade red or something but you can tell\\xa0\\xa0 just by looking at it the history that it must\\xa0\\nhave is insane and it is in that old really cool\\xa0\\xa0 gothic style directly in front of this beautiful\\xa0\\ntown hall as well we i just found our second dwarf\\xa0\\xa0 and he kind of looks like a little bit of a drunk\\xa0\\nversion of a dwarf so he kind of has a glass and\\xa0\\xa0 something that looks like a like a bottle of wine\\xa0\\nor something maybe a bottle of beer i don't know\\xa0\\xa0 but i think this is really really stunning for\\xa0\\nchildren as well to be able to go all over town\\xa0\\xa0 and just try and find all of the dwarfs everywhere\\xa0\\nand i think it's just so beautiful directly here\\xa0\\xa0 at the market square they have this really really\\xa0\\ncool relaxing area as well with a lot of sand and\\xa0\\xa0 kind of these sunbathing type of chairs where\\xa0\\nyou can just sit back and relax and you have\\xa0\\xa0 loads and loads of food stands and drink stands\\xa0\\nall around it so you're definitely not short\\xa0\\xa0 of options of what to get i already saw a stand\\xa0\\nfor sausages and which i'm already in love with\\xa0\\xa0 and one stand with pierogi so maybe that's\\xa0\\nsomething that we could do later in the video but\\xa0\\xa0 not right now and obviously never short of a nice\\xa0\\nPiwo a nice beer it's usually hard to replicate\\xa0\\xa0 a certain energy on video for you guys but i don't\\xa0\\nknow if you can tell but Wrocław is absolutely\\xa0\\xa0 buzzing there's so many people around just out and\\xa0\\nabout and enjoying the day obviously the weather\\xa0\\xa0 is beautiful um it is only a tuesday so we're\\xa0\\nonly coming up to like the middle of the work week\\xa0\\xa0 there is plenty of tourists i'm hearing plenty\\xa0\\nof german french all sorts of different tourists\\xa0\\xa0 walking through the market square and there's\\xa0\\nso many different things that you can check out\\xa0\\xa0 and do here plenty of different market stalls\\xa0\\nit almost kind of feels like christmas market\\xa0\\xa0 but it's not it's like a summer market but you\\xa0\\ncan tell that they use some of the same stalls\\xa0\\xa0 i'm just seeing a stand there with loads\\xa0\\nand loads of smoked hams and salami and\\xa0\\xa0 those types of stands especially\\xa0\\nif they have olives as well are\\xa0\\xa0 usually the death of me because\\xa0\\ni just want to eat everything\\xa0\\xa0 the city of Wrocław is definitely one of\\xa0\\nthose cities where if you are into social\\xa0\\xa0 media and you're into taking pictures for\\xa0\\ninstagram you are in the right city because\\xa0\\xa0 everywhere you turn every street that\\xa0\\nyou look at is just very photogenic and\\xa0\\xa0 photographic it's perfect for something like\\xa0\\nyour social media page there's so many unique\\xa0\\xa0 and interesting looking buildings and streets\\xa0\\nand so many people that are dressed in a very\\xa0\\xa0 alternative way so it is definitely a place to add\\xa0\\nto your list if that is something for your travel\\xa0\\xa0 criteria we just walked through a small sicilian\\xa0\\nfood market and typically if you see these types\\xa0\\xa0 of italian or spanish markets the people are\\xa0\\nnot actually italian or spanish but in this case\\xa0\\xa0 all of them were italian and this was a\\xa0\\nSicily specific food market and the\\xa0\\xa0 people were actually sicilian one of the guys\\xa0\\nsounded like my grandpa so that made me feel\\xa0\\xa0 right at home and they had Cannolies and they\\xa0\\nhad arancine and all of these things and i\\xa0\\xa0 like my sicilian heart just straight away wanted\\xa0\\nto eat everything so we need to run before i buy\\xa0\\xa0 the entire market Wrocław is located on the river\\xa0\\nOder and there is apparently a bunch of different\\xa0\\xa0 little islands one of them is like a cathedral\\xa0\\nisland apparently that you have to go and check\\xa0\\xa0 out it is in the walking tour that i copy and\\xa0\\npasted into my phone so we're on our way to the\\xa0\\xa0 river Oder and we're gonna go and check out see\\xa0\\nif we can get on a couple of these islands i'm\\xa0\\xa0 sure it's pretty spectacular looking right now\\xa0\\nwith this weather too oh there's a train coming one thing that i find really funny is as you\\xa0\\nmight have seen just on that train there there's\\xa0\\xa0 actually a football team so not like soccer\\xa0\\nfootball as in european football but american\\xa0\\xa0 football that is called the Wrocław or Wrocław\\xa0\\npanters similar to the carolina panthers they have\\xa0\\xa0 the same colors they have the same logo everything\\xa0\\nlooks the same just that it's a polish team i'm\\xa0\\xa0 sure if we would stay here for longer we would\\xa0\\ngo and check out a match because both of us are\\xa0\\xa0 big football fans on our way to the cathedral\\xa0\\nisland we stumbled across one of the stops of\\xa0\\xa0 that tour that luke keeps talking about which is\\xa0\\nthe Ossolineum it is a palace type of building\\xa0\\xa0 where you have gardens that you can walk around in\\xa0\\nall of these gardens are really really beautiful\\xa0\\xa0 with these types of little hedges that they make\\xa0\\nkind of art out of and it seems to be very very\\xa0\\xa0 popular with the people around here because as\\xa0\\nyou can see there's loads of people everywhere\\xa0\\xa0 and but it's definitely a must see if you do\\xa0\\ncome to Wrocław that Ossolineum garden area\\xa0\\xa0 there was a beautiful little pit stop along our\\xa0\\nwandering way around Wrocław and we're going\\xa0\\xa0 to head back now to the river it's just literally\\xa0\\nacross the road from the river itself and we're\\xa0\\xa0 going to try and check out this cathedral island\\xa0\\nbecause it looks pretty interesting we kind of\\xa0\\xa0 got the drone up in the air and we could see\\xa0\\nkind of across the way it looks like a really\\xa0\\xa0 spectacular looking place plenty of tourists are\\xa0\\nheading in that direction so we may as well follow we just crossed over this really cool looking red\\xa0\\nbridge and it brought us to an actual island but\\xa0\\xa0 it's not actually cathedral island we had a look\\xa0\\non google maps and cathedral island is actually\\xa0\\xa0 just over across this island but it is not an\\xa0\\nisland so it's like just basically facing where\\xa0\\xa0 we're walking to and there's a really really nice\\xa0\\npark that is on this actual island called Wyspa\\xa0\\xa0 park or Wyspa park and it seems to be super idyllic\\xa0\\nvery beautiful there's plenty of people out and\\xa0\\xa0 about today and as you can see by the tram that\\xa0\\njust crossed me there you can take those trams\\xa0\\xa0 pretty much anywhere around Wrocław it seems\\xa0\\nbecause it seems to be a very well connected city\\xa0\\xa0 in terms of public transport so that's always a\\xa0\\nbig thumbs up from us if you can easily access\\xa0\\xa0 everything that you need with public transport\\xa0\\nthat is great because typically what we do when\\xa0\\xa0 we arrive somewhere new or when we come to a\\xa0\\nnew country we try and figure out the public\\xa0\\xa0 transport system because it's usually quickest\\xa0\\ncheapest way of getting around and it's a unique\\xa0\\xa0 way as well to interact with the locals the Tumski\\xa0\\nbridge here is one of the oldest river crossings\\xa0\\xa0 in Wrocław and it connects the cathedral island\\xa0\\nwith the sand island this present steel bridge\\xa0\\xa0 was built in the years 1888 till 1892\\xa0\\nand it's a really really cool looking\\xa0\\xa0 green type of steel bridge it just it looks very\\xa0\\nunique and obviously old so i do think this is\\xa0\\xa0 a very very special place to be just in front of\\xa0\\nthis very cool Tumski bridge we found this kind of\\xa0\\xa0 a sign that is relevant when it comes to the dwarf\\xa0\\nthat has the lock on its back that we found in\\xa0\\xa0 front of this bridge and it's basically reeds all\\xa0\\naround the world bridges get cluttered with locks\\xa0\\xa0 what most people fail to realize is that nothing\\xa0\\nbrings worse look to their love than the act of\\xa0\\xa0 locking it up in a single metal cage on a bridge\\xa0\\nthe rain the river and the moisture quickly caused\\xa0\\xa0 the locks to erode and along with the corrosion of\\xa0\\nthis lock the hope the true love can survive will\\xa0\\xa0 evaporate even faster that's really cool and kind\\xa0\\nof a touching story as well because you do see\\xa0\\xa0 that happen quite often on bridges all over europe\\xa0\\ni'm not too sure about the rest of the world but\\xa0\\xa0 you do see quite a lot of people locking these\\xa0\\nsort of steel locks onto bridges with their names\\xa0\\xa0 and it's like you know eternal love we will be\\xa0\\nin love forever type of thing but that story\\xa0\\xa0 just completely destroyed that idea the dwarves\\xa0\\nthat helps with setting love free is one of the\\xa0\\xa0 interactive types of dwarves you can actually\\xa0\\npick up the key and try to open the lock obviously\\xa0\\xa0 with that little statue it doesn't work but i\\xa0\\nthink the thought of that is really beautiful\\xa0\\xa0 we just saw a picture there of one of the churches\\xa0\\nhere in cathedral island in 1945 and it kind of\\xa0\\xa0 looks like the church obviously was bombed during\\xa0\\nthe war or something bad happened to it but thank\\xa0\\xa0 god they were able to renovate the church and put\\xa0\\nthe towers back into place by adding beautiful\\xa0\\xa0 steel type of roofs to the two towers and um it's\\xa0\\njust so so stunning i want to go in and actually\\xa0\\xa0 check that church out all right guys so it makes\\xa0\\na little bit more sense now we just had a quick\\xa0\\xa0 little bit of a stop to do some research about\\xa0\\nthis place cathedral island and it is known as\\xa0\\xa0 Ostrów Tumski and it is commonly crossed over into\\xa0\\non the Tumski bridge which is pedestrian only now\\xa0\\xa0 this place used to be an island and so it makes\\xa0\\na lot of sense it's actually the oldest part of\\xa0\\xa0 Wrocław as well so it dates back all the way\\xa0\\nto the 10th century that's pretty incredible\\xa0\\xa0 and that is a long long time ago and you can\\xa0\\nsee it in a lot of the amazing architecture\\xa0\\xa0 on cathedral island all around here in cathedral\\xa0\\nisland you have these really interesting wall\\xa0\\xa0 markings that will detail you in by all the\\xa0\\nway back in history it brings you back to\\xa0\\xa0 Wrocław in 1945 for example and there is\\xa0\\nan image of this building right here with\\xa0\\xa0 this statue here too and it is in 1945 and as you\\xa0\\nmight be able to tell from the picture this entire\\xa0\\xa0 building was completely flattened and destroyed\\xa0\\nby bombs but this statue was completely untouched\\xa0\\xa0 so that is absolutely incredible and it's crazy\\xa0\\njust to be standing here and looking at both\\xa0\\xa0 pictures and seeing that contrast and how history\\xa0\\nhas unfolded here in wroclaw now this is the\\xa0\\xa0 church of saint john the baptist and we walked in\\xa0\\nbriefly kind of into the first room of the church\\xa0\\xa0 if you want to go in all the way and you have to\\xa0\\npay entry and buy a ticket which is all right we\\xa0\\xa0 just didn't do it we chose not to in this case\\xa0\\nbecause we still have like a long list of things\\xa0\\xa0 to do for today and but this church looks so so\\xa0\\nbeautiful i can hear the pierogi calling me naomi\\xa0\\xa0 whispers of pierogi all right guys so we've\\xa0\\nbeen walking around Wrocław now for a few hours\\xa0\\xa0 around two three hours now we're starting to get\\xa0\\na little bit hungry it's coming up to like roughly\\xa0\\xa0 three o'clock so we're definitely gonna go maybe\\xa0\\nback to this Rynek area the main market square\\xa0\\xa0 area see if we can get some nice food because\\xa0\\nthat man-made beach where people were chilling\\xa0\\xa0 there's plenty of options for some lovely food\\xa0\\nso that's exactly what we're gonna do let's go okay so there in the market square we just\\xa0\\ngot um two servings of pierogi one of them\\xa0\\xa0 was with meat and the other one was with potatoes\\xa0\\npotatoes yeah potatoes and cheese and potatoes\\xa0\\xa0 and cheese i forgot about the cheese yeah and\\xa0\\nthey were so so good we actually saw the lady\\xa0\\xa0 just there when we were leaving making pierogi\\xa0\\nherself from scratch so it kind of looked like\\xa0\\xa0 she was making the dough herself and the filling\\xa0\\nas well and everything around it it was just so\\xa0\\xa0 tasty they were absolutely absolutely delicious\\xa0\\nlike 10 out of 10 probably one of the best that\\xa0\\xa0 i've ever tried and that place is actually really\\xa0\\nbeautiful it's like a kind of like a beach area\\xa0\\xa0 really just out of this world super cheap as\\xa0\\nwell i think it was 40 złoty for a serving of 12\\xa0\\xa0 pierogies so we had six each and we definitely\\xa0\\nwould go there again i think we will maybe\\xa0\\xa0 tomorrow who knows for sure for sure and that\\xa0\\nplace actually from what i saw anyway\\xa0\\xa0 was a ukrainian place so they had a little sign\\xa0\\non the top saying Kuchnia Ukrainsko so like\\xa0\\xa0 a ukrainian kitchen basically and it was oh my\\xa0\\ngod i never had pierogi that were that tasty so\\xa0\\xa0 good by the way now that we know what exactly\\xa0\\nwe're looking for we're seeing dwarfs or gnomes\\xa0\\xa0 all over the city and even like before we started\\xa0\\nthe video we actually walked past a few gnomes\\xa0\\xa0 without realizing it because we didn't know what\\xa0\\nwe were looking for so yeah they're everywhere now let's talk first impressions of Wrocław and\\xa0\\ni personally think that Wrocław should definitely\\xa0\\xa0 be on your list of places to visit\\xa0\\nagain trying not to get hit by a car  it should be on your list of places to visit\\xa0\\nit should be on the same level as krakow\\xa0\\xa0 or maybe warsaw and all of these other very\\xa0\\nwell known and very well traveled places\\xa0\\xa0 because this city has just so much to offer i kind\\xa0\\nof feel like Wrocław might even have more to offer\\xa0\\xa0 than krakow for example but just because it's\\xa0\\nsuch an expansive city and you can see so many\\xa0\\xa0 different areas and like there it kind of seems\\xa0\\nlike there's something for everybody like there's\\xa0\\xa0 something for people that are interested in nature\\xa0\\nthere's arts there's history there's religion kind\\xa0\\xa0 of a little bit of everything and i just feel like\\xa0\\nit's the perfect place to be what do you think\\xa0\\xa0 yeah day one in Wrocław complete and to be honest\\xa0\\nour first impressions are my first impressions\\xa0\\xa0 this place is just a gem i know that it is a\\xa0\\nvery well spoken about city and a lot of people\\xa0\\xa0 do speak very positively about Wrocław it's\\xa0\\nnot like it's totally undiscovered or unknown\\xa0\\xa0 it is definitely on people's maps when they come\\xa0\\nto poland and so that's kind of a given but today\\xa0\\xa0 we saw a just exactly why so many people come\\xa0\\nand visit this city i totally agree with what\\xa0\\xa0 naomi said i personally prefer this to krakow i\\xa0\\npersonally prefer this to pretty much everywhere\\xa0\\xa0 that i've been actually so far although we\\xa0\\nhave been to some really incredible places\\xa0\\xa0 such as Bielsko-Biała. Bielsko-Biała stole both\\xa0\\nof our hearts zakopane did the same thing so\\xa0\\xa0 it's really impossible when you try to compare\\xa0\\nsuch different places zakopane and Bielsko-Biała\\xa0\\xa0 have nature they have stunning mountains they have\\xa0\\nthe tatras in zakopane you've got the beskydy in Bielsko-Biała so there's pros and cons\\xa0\\nto absolutely every place but so far\\xa0\\xa0 i am only seeing pros about Wrocław there's\\xa0\\nso many different types of places to get food\\xa0\\xa0 and it is a really diverse city as well so super\\xa0\\npositive first impressions for us from Wrocław\\xa0\\xa0 i couldn't agree more but that is already\\xa0\\nit from us today you guys very quick first\\xa0\\xa0 impressions my name is naomi my name is luke we\\xa0\\nare the two mad explorers and we'll see you guys\\xa0\\xa0 in the next video and this is a reminder to keep\\xa0\\nexploring i always forget the last part i thought\\xa0\\xa0 i had to say that again okay thanks for watching\\xa0\\npeace i can hear the pierogi calling me naomi whispers of pierogi\",\n",
       " 'The Polish state was the first nation to fall\\nin this war, but the Polish people are far from defeated. Fired by vengeance and hope\\nof liberation, Polish troops fight for the Allied cause. Whether it’s in the skies\\nover Britain, the hills and valleys of Italy, or the mud and blood of the Eastern Front,\\nyou can be sure there are Poles there fighting. I’m Indy Neidell, this is a World War Two\\nSpecial on the Polish Armed Forces in exile. I said armed forces – plural - because after\\nthe dual invasion of Poland by the Wehrmacht and Red Army in September 1939, Polish servicemen\\nare scattered across Europe and beyond. After the Soviets invade on September 17,\\nPolish Commander-in-Chief Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły orders his troops to do what many other Poles\\nare doing and save themselves by fleeing to Romania or Hungary. By summer 1940, about\\n70,000 Polish soldiers have made the journey and many of them are in internment camps.\\nThese, though are apparently quite easy to escape. Franciszek Nedza is one of many who\\ndoes so when his hosts simply look the other way. “On every railway station was the police,\\nchecking every train. Before we left camp we dressed in new civilian clothes, poor and\\ncheap, and we managed to reach Budapest… In Budapest we had to wait for some documents\\nto cross into Yugoslavia… We crossed the river by boat and on the other side was a\\ncoachman and two horses waiting for us to take us to Zagreb.” After Yugoslavia, France is his final destination.\\nBy April 1940, 45,000 have made it there via land or sea. For many France is the ultimate\\ndestination. Many of them form the core of the new Polish armed force ready to take the\\nfight to the Germans and win back their homeland. Except their new hosts don’t see things\\nquite the same way. Polish Prime Minister in Exile Władysław\\nSikorski gets on well enough with the French, but they aren’t keen on military offensives\\nor an independent Polish force. It goes against their hopes for a negotiated settlement...\\nat Poland’s expense. Nonetheless, the Polish Army in France is growing and growing. The\\nFrench have allowed Poles who were already living in the country before the outbreak\\nof the war to join the force although those working in restricted occupations like mining\\nhave to stay at their jobs. Altogether this means there is a force of about 80,000 Poles\\nwhen the Germans invade in May 1940. The Battle of France is a complete disaster\\nfor the Poles. I mean, it’s a complete disaster for all the Allies, but Polish losses are\\ndisproportionately high. The French press the underequipped and undertrained Poles into\\nthe line. Training units like the Polish armoured school and the officer and NCO schools are\\npushed into frontline combat. The French also take Polish anti-tank companies and artillery\\nfor themselves. And when hastily installed French Prime Minister\\nPhillipe Petain asks Germany for an armistice on June 18, the Poles feel totally betrayed.\\nThe next day, Sikorski urges all Poles to evacuate France and head for Britain. Once again, they are on the move. A lot of\\nthe men end up fending for themselves during the dash to the ports. Josef Zachwieja sets\\noff by car: “The roads were packed with refugees and\\npushcarts… After two days we were near to La Rochelle, but the Germans had got there\\nfirst, so we were diverted to Bordeaux. We went along the Southern side of the Gironde\\nto Le Verdon where four British ships were waiting. It took more than half a day to get\\nloaded. We were attacked by waves of Stukas… while a few boys got hit by machine gun fire,\\nnot a single bomb hit the ships. The nearest thing to a miracle I have ever seen… That\\nwas the 23rd of June. On 26th June we arrived in Liverpool and on my first night in Britain\\nI slept on a bench in Liverpool football stadium. Next morning, we were put on the train to\\nScotland.” He’s one of the lucky ones. Only about a\\nquarter of the Polish forces make it to Britain, about 20,000 men. Most are taken prisoner,\\nsome escape elsewhere, and some even slip away and join the French Resistance. The Polish\\nground forces are formed into the Polish I Corps and guard Scotland against German invasion.\\nReally, they are little more than a division. But the impressive title keeps morale up,\\nand compared to the British Home Guard the well trained and experienced Poles are nothing\\nto be sneered at. The Corps will never fight as a single formation, but individual units\\nwill be attached to other Allied forces later in the war. Looking ahead a little to 1942,\\nthese units will be the 1st Polish Armoured Division, 1st Independent Rifle Brigade, 1st\\nIndependent Parachute Brigade, and the Training Brigade. The Polish Navy is also in Britain. They actually\\nescaped Poland back in 1939. They have three destroyers and two submarines and have seen\\naction in the invasion of Norway and the evacuation from France. They will continue fighting alongside\\nthe Royal Navy until the end of the war. In 1940 and 1941, though, it’s the Polish\\npilots who steal the show. They fight in two Polish squadrons, 302 Poznanski and 303 Kosciuszko.\\nAt the height of the Battle of Britain in September 1940, Polish pilots form 12% of\\nFighter Command’s strength. 303 squadron are the highest scoring in the RAF. Head of\\nFighter Command Hugh Dowding later writes “had it not been for the magnificent work\\nof the Polish squadrons and their unsurpassed gallantry, I hesitate to say that the outcome\\nof the Battle would have been the same.\" So, the Polish pilots are winning hearts in\\nBritain. But some of their countrymen are in a truly miserable situation. We’ve talked before about the Katyn Massacre\\nof 22,000 Polish officers, police, and intellectuals in 1940, but there are still approximately\\n2 million Polish men, women, and children being held in prisons and labour camps across\\nthe USSR. The British and the Polish government in exile in London reckon that between 100,000\\nand 250,000 could be suitable for military service. Sikorski has been pressing the British\\nto help him tap into that pool of manpower. The problem is that Josef Stalin doesn’t\\nrecognise Sikorski’s government in exile. All this changes when Germany invades the\\nSoviet Union and Stalin finds himself in alliance with the Poles. On July 30 1941, Sikorski\\nand the Soviet ambassador to Britain Ivan Mayski re-establish relations. Their agreement\\ngrants amnesty to Polish citizens held in the USSR from whom a Polish Army can be established\\non Soviet territory. After much negotiating, the British and the Poles manage to ensure\\nthat this Polish Army will be loyal solely to Sikorski’s government. From there, things move slowly and painfully.\\nPoles released from captivity make their way to recruitment camps northeast of Stalingrad.\\nBy November these hold about 40,000 men and women. Sikorski chooses General Władysław Anders\\nto command this army. He decides to move his forces to various military camps in the ‘stans.\\nUzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan. Polish soldiers and civilians make arduous\\njourneys from across the USSR. Kazimerz Szmid is a Polish teenager who is separated from\\nhis family while travelling to Uzbekistan: “The trains were totally unreliable... I\\ncan\\'t begin to describe the absolute mess, confusion and uncertainty that existed. At\\na place called Kuybyshev, my father and I left to find some food and when we returned\\nthe train had departed with my mother and younger sister. We tried to catch up, but\\nthis was an impossible task. At this point my father became ill and eventually died,\\nI don\\'t know where. I buried him and was on my own. What I did to survive I would not\\nrather talk about… The hunger was unbearable, and I would lie there thinking what I would\\ngive for a piece of bread.” Things aren’t all that much better when\\nthe Poles arrive in Central Asia. The Soviets are only supplying rations for 44,000 even\\nthough Anders has 70,000 military personnel and tens of thousands of civilians by the\\nspring of 1942. Hunger and sickness are rife, and the dead fill newly built Polish cemeteries. Anders wants to get his people out of the\\nUSSR. Not only are they dying before they even make it to the battlefield, but he also\\nbelieves that the new German offensive – Fall Blau – will overrun the Soviet Union. But\\nSikorski wants to have Poles fighting on the Eastern Front alongside the Soviets. It’s\\ngood for the alliance, keeping both Stalin and Churchill happy. In March, Anders manages\\nto get permission from Stalin to evacuate 44,000 military personnel to the British part\\nof occupied Iran. It helps that by now Churchill wants extra manpower in North Africa and the\\nMiddle East. The first evacuation begins on March 24 and\\nAnders pushes his luck and evacuates 45,000 military personnel and over 25,000 civilians.\\nIt\\'s a real slog of a journey crossing Soviet central Asia in trucks and railway cattle\\ncars and then by steamship over the Caspian Sea. The final destination is the Iranian\\npart of Pahlevi. Adela Krasnopolska remembers the sea voyage: “We left the Soviet Union,\\nthat inhuman land. We sailed through the Caspian Sea to Persia and Iraq. Some people on the\\nship died during the voyage, and their bodies were thrown into the sea.” Anders receives\\npermission to evacuate the rest of the Poles between July and September. By the end he\\nhas evacuated 114,500 people. 78,000 are servicemen and women. The rest are civilians. Once the Poles are in Iran, the British sort\\nthem into a fighting force, but again, the Poles find themselves in disagreement with\\nan ally. Sikorski wants an army of two corps, each\\nof two divisions, plus a brigade of tanks for a total of about 55,000 men. But after\\ntheir ordeal, so many of the Poles are unfit for service that the British believe only\\na single corps of two infantry divisions and a brigade of tanks is possible. Churchill\\nsays he’s been waiting for the Poles for two years and he won’t wait any longer for\\nreinforcements. It\\'s not just military disagreements either. News of the Katyn massacre emerges\\nin April 1943 and the Polish government immediately calls for an independent Red Cross investigation.\\nChurchill tries pushing them in the other direction, telling Sikorski “If they are\\ndead, nothing you can do will bring them back.” Sikorski withdraws his demand for an investigation\\non the condition that the Anglo-Americans press Stalin to release more Poles held in\\nthe USSR. See, the Soviets have declared that hundreds of thousands of Poles are not covered\\nby the amnesty either for technical reasons or because they are under investigation by\\nthe Soviet state. But even though Sikorski gives up his demand for a Red Cross investigation,\\nthe Soviets break off relations with the Polish Government on April 24. This will have huge\\nramifications pretty soon. Back in the Middle East, Anders’ Army goes\\nfrom Iran to Iraq and then Palestine. Here they merge with the Carpathian Brigade in\\nJune. Backtracking just a bit here, the Carpathian\\nBrigade is made up of Poles who escaped Romania and Hungary into the Middle East. The Brigade\\nhad been serving with the French in Syria at the time of the Armistice in 1940. After\\nthis, they escaped to British Palestine. Composed of about 5,000 men and officers they fought\\nwell in North Africa alongside British and Commonwealth forces against the Axis. Since\\nMarch 1942 they’ve been back in Palestine waiting for something to do. Anders’ Army and the Carpathian Brigade\\nbecome Polish II Corps. Initially, it consists of three units. The Carpathian brigade is\\nexpanded into the 3rd Carpathian Infantry Division. The two others are the 5th Kresowa\\nInfantry Division and the 2nd Polish Armoured Brigade. And that pretty much brings us to where we\\nare now, December 1943 when the Carpathians start arriving in Italy. The rest of the Corps\\nwill follow early next year. The Poles won’t see battle until March and their baptism of\\nfire will be in May at a place called Monte Cassino. Every step they take is one step\\ncloser to liberating their home, right? Well, not quite. Poland is in the middle of\\na tug-of-war between the Western Powers and the Soviet Union. Remember how Stalin let Anders’ Army go?\\nWell, he’s been busy creating a replacement. You see there are some, not many, but some\\nPolish officers and men who didn’t want to leave the Soviet Union. About sixty of\\nthe officers responded positively to Soviet ideals during their captivity. There are also\\nstill lots of Poles left scattered across the USSR. Back in May, one of those officers named Colonel\\nZygmunt Berling was chosen by Stalin to lead something called the First Tadeuz Kosciuszko\\nInfantry Division. The Division is under the political control of the Union of Polish Patriots,\\nan organisation of Polish Communists in the USSR. The soldiers took an oath of “fidelity\\nto the alliance with the Soviet Union\\xa0and\\xa0adherence to the brotherhood of arms of the allied Red\\nArmy.” The Polish Government in London is enraged and sentences Berling to death in\\nabsentia. The division sees its first action at the\\nBattle of Lenino. The Soviets aren’t hugely successful at attracting Poles, though. I\\nmean, 3/4 of its senior officers are Soviet citizens. But the force is growing and by\\nnext year it will be expanded into an Army Corps of about 80,000 men. Berling’s Army really isn’t representative\\nof Poland. But they are pushing westward with the Red Army. Stalin has set up his own Soviet-friendly\\nPolish government in exile and this new military force will help him stake his claim to Poland.\\nAnders’ men have gone through hell to get to where they are now. Soon they’ll be throwing\\nthemselves at the German defensive lines in Italy. They hope that the Western Allies will\\nreward their service with a liberated Poland. But as the saying goes, possession is nine\\ntenths of the law. Their sacrifice might all be for nothing if Stalin’s men make it to\\nWarsaw first. Only time will tell.

       " \"Hi everybody, this Eva zu Beck for DW Travel \\nand dzień dobry from Poland! Today I want to show you the most \\nbeautiful village in the entire country but before we head over there, \\nlet me take you on a super quick tour of Kraków,  the cultural capital of Poland. Let's go! Kraków pops up on most \\ntravel itineraries in Poland, thanks to its rich history and fairy tale beauty. The entire old town is a \\nUNESCO World Heritage Site with architecture dating back\\nto medieval and renaissance times. In fact, Kraków as a city \\nis so old that it predates  the official establishment\\nof Poland as a country. Honestly, it's hard not to love it here. But today, I'm on my way to a very different\\nkind of place, a two-hour drive away from Kraków. It's a little less grand than the big city,\\nmaybe, but it has an intriguing story of its own. Allright, it looks like we've just arrived here in Zalipie.  Zalipie, by the way, it's considered to be \\nPoland's most beautiful village. I see a map over there,\\nso let's stop for a second and see what exactly we can check out here. It looks like these are all the houses that\\nwe can see here, so we are right here right now. There's a museum over there on the other side\\nof the village, and all of these colorful points  are private houses, privately owned homes which are decorated \\nin the traditional Zalipian style. So let's start at the beginning. Somewhere right here. It's helpful to have a map, \\nbut my favorite way to explore new places is to simply get lost in them. Zalipie is a small village \\nwith a very specific claim to fame. It first appeared on the tourist radar about\\nten years ago when the story of these painted houses  became widely shared in Poland. We will go to that story a little bit later in the episode. For now, let's take a look around! So, looks like this courtyard is empty, there's\\nnobody here, but the gate is open to visitors, and there's a lot of people who come and check\\nout the beautiful paintings on the houses, so I think I will just gonna go inside. Wow, this place is absolutely\\nbeautiful. Come take a look! I know it doesn't really look like it, \\nbut this is a door that leads to a cellar. It's probably the most beautiful cellar door\\nI've ever seen in my life. Check this out, all of these colours, all of \\nthese flowers are hand-painted by the people who live in this house. So you've got really\\nlovely summer motives, you've got sunflowers, you've got orange, and red, and purple flowers. You can see that the people who create these\\npaintings really care a lot about keeping up tradition.  And that's just not something\\nthat you see every day anymore. Can I take this with me? Check this out. I'm super excited to show you this house specifically. So I'm Polish, and my great-grandma \\nused to live in a house similar to this one. A house like this in Poland is called a khata\\nand khatas are traditional wooden cottages with thatched roofs, so this is what that is. \\nAnd in addition, because it's in Zalipie, this khata is also painted. It's so awesome, honestly, I wish I could\\njust take this house, move in and live in it. It's so cute. This isn't like the cutest home \\nyou've ever see in your life? Some people here in the village have found a way to commemorate the floral tradition of Zalipie. The lady that owns this house has learned\\nthe craft of painting flowers from her grandma, and she inherited this beautiful home.  So now she runs a little shop \\nwith handpainted souvenirs. And she makes all sorts of different\\nbeautiful things in her own signature style. And I think the best thing for me \\nabout this room is this spot right here. I don't know if you know what this is, but\\nit's a traditional old-school Polish oven. In here you make bread,\\npancakes, potatoes, anything. This is basically a kitchen,\\nyou can also sleep on top. Again, I remember my great-grandma \\nhad an oven like this in her house,  and we used to sit on top of it \\non really cold winter days and warm ourselves up. Obviously, it serves a slightly different purpose here. I want to take a look at some of the handmade\\nsouvenirs that the lady has gotten in here. So, initially, before coming to the village\\nof Zalipie, I was a little bit worried  that this place will be super touristy, but being\\nhere right now, it's completely not like that. You know, there's a real sense that it is\\nan actual normal village which it is. Some of the houses are painted, others are not \\nand the people who live in this village  are just normal ordinary people. So it feels \\nreally natural and cool and welcoming. And a little bit special without any of that \\ntouristy artifice that you see in some places. After spending a couple of hours\\nin the village, I met up with Maria, one of the traditional painters from Zalipie. I wanted to ask her how\\nthe flower paintings came about and what the newfound wave \\nof tourism means to the village. I'm here with Maria, who is about to show\\nme the local art of painting flowers. So I'm about to learn something. I've got this little piece of wood. I've got a brush, we've got some water, \\nwe got some paints. I think we're ready to get started. So I'm about to paint my second type of flower. Well, it wasn't quite the same level of craft\\nas the artists from the village,  but let's say it wasn't the worst of my work. So, check this out. I have made this under the very helpful supervision\\nof Maria, but this is still something I made. The final touch on my masterpiece is to write\\nthe name of the village of Zalipie as a signature. The village of Zalipie is a great example\\nof responsible tourism done right in Poland.

       " \"After the death of the Swedish King John III\\nin the autumn of 1592, his son Sigismund III Vasa was next in line to succeed him. Since Sigismund had been elected as King of\\nPoland and Grand Duke of Lithuania only five years earlier, his accession to the Swedish\\nthrone was set to create a personal union between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth\\nand the Kingdom of Sweden. Sigismund sailed with his fleet across the\\nBaltic Sea in September 1593 and headed for Stockholm with many companions and the most\\ninfluential nobles from Poland and Lithuania. However, his arrival meant more than a change\\nof ruler in Sweden. Since Sigismund was a Catholic and a great\\nsupporter of the Roman Church and the Pope, this represented a significant increase in\\nthe influence of Catholicism in the country. At that time, Sweden was mostly Protestant,\\nand only a few months before the arrival of Sigismund, under the influence of Duke Charles,\\nthe Uppsala Synod was held, and the Lutheran Church of Sweden decided to make Lutheranism\\nthe state religion. Although he was a staunch Catholic, King Sigismund\\nof Poland was forced to recognize this decision to be accepted as King of Sweden, setting\\nthe stage for both internal religious conflicts in Sweden and further Wars\\nbetween Poland and Sweden. In February 1594, Sigismund was crowned as\\nKing of Sweden and the personal union between  Poland and Sweden became a reality. Shortly after his coronation, Sigismund returned\\nto Poland and by agreement, he left his uncle Duke Charles and the Swedish Privy Council\\nto share power over the Scandinavian kingdom because of his stay in Poland. After Sigismund left, the situation in the\\ncountry became even more complicated. The Swedes did not have sympathy for their\\nking, and in 1595 a parliament was held without the presence of Sigismund, making the decision\\nto appoint Charles as regent of Sweden. In response to this, the Finnish nobility,\\nsupported by King Sigismund, rejected the decision on the grounds that it was illegal\\nand openly declared Charles a rebel. Large engagements soon broke out throughout\\nSweden and Finland, and after years of unrest, in 1597, Duke Charles emerged victorious from\\nthe Civil War. Seeing the situation, Sigismund decided to\\npersonally intervene in this conflict. In the spring of 1598, he raised an army composed\\nmostly of mercenaries near Gdańsk and, together with his Swedish supporters, set out for Kingdom\\nof Sweden in the summer. After a few days of sailing, Sigismund and his fleet\\nreached Kalmar, which surrendered without a fight. King Sigismund initially held the advantage\\nand conquered several fortifications, including Sweden’s most important city, Stockholm. He then defeated his uncle Charles at the\\nBattle of Stegeborg, but negotiations began between the two soon after. Charles took advantage of this ceasefire to\\ngain the initiative. After being defeated at the Battle of Linköping,\\nSigismund made a treaty with Charles and left the country, but did not relinquish the title\\nof King of Sweden. Duke Charles used this to regain the lost\\ncities and establish his rule, settling accounts with the supporters of King Sigismund. By the autumn of 1599, the entirety of Sweden\\nand Finland were under his control. During that time, the Swedish parliament officially\\noverthrew Sigismund and offered to proclaim his infant son Władysław as king on the\\ncondition that he would be raised in Sweden, where he was to be brought up following the\\nLutheran faith. As a devoted Catholic, Sigismund rejected\\nthis proposal and thus the personal union between Poland and Sweden ceased to exist. Consequently, the conflict between Sigismund\\nand Charles continued. Sigismund began searching for allies throughout\\nEurope to support him in his conflict with his uncle. Diplomats were sent to Russia, where they tried\\nto form closer ties to the Russian Tsar Boris Godunov. Letters were further sent to the Pope, the\\nHabsburgs, and the Danes, but these diplomatic actions mostly ended without success. Although the Polish Sejm, the Parliament of\\nnobles that held significant power in the country, were disinterested in Sigismund's\\nattempt to remain on the Swedish throne, their view of the conflict changed drastically when Duke Charles\\nlanded in Estonia with 14,000 troops in 1600. Charles quickly took control of a number of\\ncities that had previously been part of the Kingdom of Sweden but had supported Sigismund\\nin the civil war. In the fall of 1600, the Swedes launched an offensive\\ninto Latvia, which was officially part of the Commonwealth. The Swedish army made significant gains, capturing\\nseveral cities, and breaking through to the Western Dvina River, directly threatening\\nRiga and besieging the city of Koknese. Consequently, the Polish Sejm realized that\\nDuke Charles was not only a threat to Sigismund in their fight for the Swedish crown, but also an enemy\\nof the entire Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. More money was quickly allocated to the army\\nand Lithuanian commander Jan Karol Chodkiewicz was withdrawn from Moldova and sent to the\\nnorthern front. The Poles counterattacked, recapturing lost\\nterritories and defeating the Swedish army, forcing it to retreat North to Estonia. Following this, the war devolved into a series\\nof bloody sieges until the Battle of Weissenstein, after which the Swedes found themselves in\\nan increasingly difficult position. However, disagreements within the Polish Sejm\\nled to the neglection of the northern front, instead focusing on conflicts with the Hapsburgs\\nand Ottomans in Moldavia and exploiting the Russian Time of Troubles to the East. Meanwhile, Charles was preparing for an even\\nbloodier war. In 1604 he was proclaimed King of Sweden and high taxes\\nwere introduced to finance the war with Poland. Russian Tsar Boris Godunov also financially\\nhelped Sweden to draw the attention of the Poles and postpone the potential Commonwealth\\ninvasion of Russia. With large sums of money, King Charles IX\\nraised a strong army and hired a large number of mercenaries from across Europe, landing in Estonia\\nand Latvia in the summer and autumn of 1605. The Swedish army was divided into three parts. The first landing took place near Reval, from\\nwhere the army headed south. The second landing was near Riga, and from there the Swedes\\ntried to surprise the enemy and quickly conquer the city. However, the impressive Lithuanian commander Jan Karol\\nChodkiewicz managed to prevent the fall of Riga. Despite facing severe shortages of money,\\nresources and support from the Polish Sejm, Chodkiewicz persistently resisted the Swedish\\narmy. He soon left a small part of his troops near\\nRiga to defend the city, heading north with the rest to intercept the Swedish army that\\nwas advancing from Estonia. In September, King Charles IX himself landed\\nat Pärnu, where he united with another section of his army and also marched on Riga to conquer\\nthe besieged city. Realizing that he was faced by a significantly\\nlarger force, Chodkiewicz gave up the interception and retreated towards Kircholm, where he encamped. When the Swedish king reached Riga, learning\\nthat the enemy army was nearby, he decided to use the opportunity his numerical superiority\\ngave him to destroy the Polish army. At dawn on September 27, the Polish-Lithuanian\\ncommander received news that the Swedish army was nearby and marching towards his camp. The troops were awoken and took up their fighting\\ndecisions. In the Swedish camp, King Charles IX deployed\\nhis army into 4 lines. In the first row, under the command of Anders\\nLennartsson, were 7 infantry regiments in square formations comprised of both pikemen\\nand musketeers, with overlapping arcs of fire. Between these regiments were large gaps that served for the\\npassage of cavalry through the line to harass the foe. In the second row was the cavalry, deployed\\nin 3 regiments of Finnish and 3 regiments of Swedish reiters under the command of Generals\\nBrandt and Mansfield. The third row was once again formed of infantry, deployed in \\n6 regiments under the command of Frederick of Lüneburg. The fourth and final line contained 5 cavalry regiments\\nof reiters under the command of King Charles. In total, the Swedes had about 8,000 infantry\\non the field, 2,500 cavalry and 11 cannons, primarily deployed in the first line. On the other hand, Chodkiewicz placed Lieutenant\\nWincenty Woyn in the center with a detachment of hussars and with Polish haiduc infantry\\non their flanks. The right wing was also formed of hussars\\nled by Jan Piotr Sapieha, while the left wing was the most numerous and was composed of\\nmixed cavalry units, among which were hussars but also light cavalry such as the Cossacks. The Polish Left was under the command of Tomasz\\nDąbrowa, forming the traditional strong Left Wing of the so-called ‘Old Polish Order’\\nof battle. Behind this first line was a second and third,\\ncontaining more hussars, but also other cavalry units, such as the Cossacks, and reiters from Courland\\nwho crossed the river just before the battle lend assistance. There was also a reserve force behind the\\narmy, while a small detachment remained in the camp. Chodkiewicz had about 2,500 cavalry and about\\n1,000 infantry under his command, making the Swedish king numerically three times stronger\\nthan the Poles. The two armies stood opposing one anther but\\nneither King Charles nor Hetman Chodkiewicz gave the command to attack. Both armies were in strong positions on two\\nseparate hills, while a plain stretched between them. Although numerically superior, the Swedish\\nking did not want to abandon his positions and face the hussars, known for the strength\\nand ferocity of their charge, on open ground. Chodkiewicz also believed that charging uphill\\nagainst solid formations of pikemen and musketeers would be suicidal. However, after a lengthy wait, the Poles made\\nthe opening move. The Polish light cavalry left their positions and rushed\\ntowards the Swedish infantry, which held its ground. This was no mass cavalry charge, but only smaller\\nand faster detachments to harass the foe. Although fighting had broken out, the engagement\\nbetween the Polish light cavalry and the Swedish infantry was really a series of smaller skirmishes in which\\nthe Poles tried to lure the Swedes into a general attack. These clashes were limited, and losses were\\nminimal on both sides, mainly due to the inaccuracy of contemporary firearms at such distances. After several hours of skirmishing, the Polish cavalry\\ngave up and headed back towards the main army. During that time, Hetman Chodkiewicz, realizing\\nthat the Swedes did not intend to leave their positions, and knowing that he could not win\\nthe battle simply by charging uphill against a more numerous opponent, ordered his entire\\narmy to retreat to the east. Seeing the enemy leave the battle, King Charles\\nIX decided to follow him and use the opportunity to destroy as many Polish troops as possible. The first line of infantry, moved forward,\\nwhile the cavalry from the second line spread out onto the flanks and also began to advance. Descending onto the plain, the Swedes were\\nnow headed uphill towards the retreating Poles. However, instead of abandoned positions and\\nspoils of war the Swedes saw a mass of Polish hussars and reiters rushing towards them. In addition to the charge of enemy’s cavalry,\\nstrong infantry and artillery fire opened up, further adding to the disorder and panic\\ncaused by the oncoming cavalry. It was at this moment that King Charles of\\nSweden realized that the Polish withdrawal was in fact a feigned retreat, and that the\\nPoles had succeeded in luring the Swedes away from their favorable defensive positions. A strong Polish charge collided with the center\\nof the Swedish infantry and inflicted heavy casualties. Simultaneously, the Polish cavalry rushed towards\\nthe horsemen on both flanks of the Swedish army. As Hetman Chodkiewicz concentrated the largest\\nnumber of his cavalry on his left wing, the Polish charge was most effective here. After a brutal clash that lasted mere minutes,\\nthe entire Swedish right wing began to flee. The Swedish infantry, with the threat of having\\ntheir flank turned by the feared Polish hussars, also started a gradual retreat. Realizing the dire situation, King Charles\\nattempted to strengthen his front lines, bringing his cavalry reserve forwards. However, due to the great distance which had\\nopened, the second infantry line was now too far to join the battle, leaving the army divided\\ninto two parts. Hence, King Charles could only send his cavalry\\nas reinforcements. During that time, the Swedish infantry continued\\nto retreat slowly while a fierce battle was being fought between the Swedish left and\\nthe Polish right wing. The outcome hung in the balance, due to the disparity\\nin strength between the Polish left and right flanks. The Swedish cavalry reserve arrived and began\\nto turn the tide against the Poles. Having lost the initiative, and suffering\\nlosses, the Polish right began a gradual withdrawal. In response, Chodkiewicz sent a section of\\nhis reserve forces composed of hussars and light cavalry towards the endangered right\\nwing. This detachment was commanded by Teodor Lacki. Approaching the battlefield, Teodor Lacki\\nattacked the exposed left flank of the Swedish left wing, driving into their formation and\\nsowing panic. Within half an hour of fighting, the Swedish\\nleft wing started to leave the field in panic, and seeing their escape, the rest of the Swedish cavalry\\non the battlefield also started a disorganized retreat. Seeing this, King Charles IX himself abandoned\\nthe battle, but soon lost his horse and escaped only because a Swedish handed the monarch\\nhis own mount. However, the bloodiest part of the battle\\nwas yet to follow. After the Swedish cavalry had withdrawn, the infantry force\\nwas left exposed and divided into two detachments. Their bulky and slowly moving square formations\\nwere unable to escape the Polish cavalry. Threatened from the flanks and rear, they\\nwere subjected to numerous charges by the hussars, while between charges they were attacked\\nby hajduk infantry and cannons. Step by bloody step, their strength waned,\\nuntil the battle turned into a complete massacre. After the collapse of the last resistance, thousands\\nof Swedish soldiers lay dead on the battlefield. According to some sources, the total Swedish\\nlosses amounted to up to 8,000 men, while the Poles had only 100 dead and 200 wounded. Given such light losses, the biggest blow\\nfor the Poles was the loss of a large number of horses, decreasing the mobility and thus\\nthe strength of their army. After the Battle of Kircholm, the Swedish army\\nabandoned the siege of Riga, fleeing back to Sweden. However, Hetman Chodkiewicz could not exploit\\nthis magnificent victory since the troops were not given their pay, leading to discontent\\namongst the ranks and an inability to purchase supplies or fodder for their horses. Although the news of Battle of Kircholm spread\\nthroughout Europe, the money to finance the war from the Polish Sejm never arrived, leading\\nthe campaign to grind to a halt. Despite the routing and destruction of much\\nof the Swedish army, the Poles were unable to regain their lost territories in Latvia. Due to the weakness of both sides, the war\\nin Latvia was without major clashes until 1608, when the Swedes once again raised an\\narmy and went on the offensive. But Swedish army was again stopped by Hetman\\nChodkiewicz. However, in 1611, the Swedes signed an armistice\\nwith the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, as they were forced to turn to other battlefields…\",\n",

       " \"there are more and more indications that the winter of 223 224 will be one of the worst moments for Ukraine since the beginning of the epidemic. Russia, despite some successes and the operation aimed at breaking through the left bank of the Dnieper, the Ukrainian offensive is at an impasse and Russia seems to be preparing for a massive attack which may actually happen At any moment, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky warned against the possibility of an increase in Russian attacks on Ukraine's infrastructure this winter. In one of his last speeches, he emphasized that Ukraine must prepare for an increased number of drone or missile attacks on the country's infrastructure. Zelensky also thanked several countries, including Poland, for the support provided to Ukraine in strengthening its air defense. However, there are many indications that if this country finds itself against the proverbial wall, Poland will have to provide assistance, as usual, because we and Romania are the only ones who can save Ukraine from energy collapse. Poland and Romania are said to have already prepared high-voltage transformers which the Ukrainians will take when they need them, as written in The economist. According to the undp report, in April 2023, the electricity generation capacity in Ukraine decreased by 51 % compared to the period just before the Russian invasion in February 2022, although Ukraine boasts of improving its anti-missile shield with the help of, among others, Poland, the USA or other allied countries, the strike force that Russia is currently gathering in Crimea may shake the stability of the Ukrainian state, so Poland can expect further Ukrainian requests for help, and it is now receiving them as a partner Today's material is the Ley shops cashback platform, to use their services you need to go to the link in the description and then download the application or log in to the platform, for example using Facebook or Google, the whole process is very simple and will take only a few seconds Leti shops also has the option yes called hot cashback, for example, it is now available on Allegro hot cashback from your purchases will be five times larger than standard, so it's worth hurrying because it's a really good opportunity, you can save much more money, and no matter how you look at it, the holidays are coming now, so money for gifts They will definitely come in handy. Leti shops also thought about this by creating a lottery for you in which you can win as much as PLN 100,000. You have time to enter this lottery from November 20, 2023 to December 22, 2023 at 6:00 p.m. All you need to do is register in Leti Shop, accept the lottery regulations and make purchases in selected partner stores using their platform, for each purchase you receive lottery tickets, link to Leti Shop from their lottery and hot cashback on Allegro are in the description I think it's worth using, there will always be something left in your pocket Well, now it's time for today's material, I invite you energy from Polish power plants has been saving Ukraine from Blackout for a long time Our neighbor in mid-August was struggling with heat and record demand for electricity, so he bought energy from us on an unprecedented scale, as the Ukrainian network operator explained, this is the best option But the alternative is to turn off electricity to consumers before the Russian invasion. Ukraine was able to produce much more energy than it consumed. This allowed it to survive when part of the energy system was destroyed by the invaders. It also had transformers that had just been decommissioned and could be reconnected to the grid when the Russians destroyed them. the newer ones, nevertheless, between October 10 and the end of December last year, the average Ukrainian household did not have electricity for a total period of five weeks, hence Ukraine has now informed Poland that in the event of further infrastructure destruction it will need it. Once again, energy support from Poland, of course, Kiev has pay for this energy because, as you know, if there were deliveries for the glory of the homeland, many Poles would probably not be satisfied with this fact, especially since the relations between Poland and Ukraine have recently become significantly cooler, but the authorities of our eastern neighbors are as usual There have been requests for much more than that a dozen or so days ago, on November 2 , 2023, the President of Ukraine, Vlad Zelensky, appeared at the forum of the Supreme Council of Poland with an appeal for help in the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war, in his speech he said that Ukraine needs to rebuild everything that Russia has destroyed, we need Poland to rebuild our country to be able to live in peace and security, which is important Załęski He also emphasized that Poland is one of Ukraine's most important allies in the fight against Russia He thanked Poland for the help provided to Ukraine since the beginning of the war, including accepting over 2 and 5 million refugees from Ukraine at the same time Counting on our country's support in rebuilding the war damage, may we participate in this reconstruction, and hopefully this time not for nothing, it is disturbing that some in Europe are playing Solidarity in the political theater, turning the seed into a thriller. The words of the President of Ukraine spoken at the UN about the play of some countries in the Moscow theater and the cooling of mutual relations in August were completely unnecessary and many Poles he certainly holds it against him. Especially since in terms of military support for the defending Ukrainians, Poland is at the forefront and has often given more than it really could. The undisputed leader here is, of course, the United States, whose support has so far cost almost as much as In my opinion, this is what it is heading towards, and it is increasingly coming to the attention of both warring parties to Putin, and they both know that the Chinese and the Americans want to stop the escalation of military actions, to stop military operations, to reach a ceasefire, and most importantly, the vast majority of this equipment has already reached Ukraine, it includes Patriot systems, Abrams tanks and Haars long-range artillery systems. The Polish government does not conduct regular cyclical information activities. So there is no complete information about the deliveries, but what we have provided is worth over USD 4 billion, causing To this day, we are among the six countries that have provided the Ukrainians with the most military equipment, but this amount is greatly underestimated because they often gave us equipment whose value on the market differed significantly due to its age, so the amount of even $6 to $8 billion may not be at all be greatly exaggerated because not everything was included in the official data, let's first take into account tanks, among those delivered to Kiev the T72 dominates, well known to the Russians because of the Soviet design, Poland delivered the largest number of this type of vehicles and, according to unofficial data, at least 250 versions of this type were delivered to Ukraine t72m t72 M1 and t72 m1r When it comes to tanks, Poland has no equal, no one, not even the Americans, delivered as many of them as we did, the Polish authorities also sent 10 MiG 29s and declared the transfer of, among others, the S60 anti-aircraft guns along with 70,000 missiles intended for them, among others. equipment transferred from Poland to Ukraine also included various types of small arms, including grenade launchers, mortars and, among others, carbines, lightning bolts, Stinger launchers and many others. Also, the Polish defense industry plays a huge role in rearmament. Only last year, the Ukrainian side signed a contract with Huta Stalowa Wola , the manufacturer of guns, hit scrab, contract for the construction of 56 crabs, as noted by The economist, despite the delivery of such a huge amount of equipment during the 5 months of the counteroffensive, Ukraine managed to move the front line by only 17 km, and as the dependent general stated, currently the fighting is at a stalemate and without major supplies from the West in Therefore, Poland's continued counteroffensive and even defense may be much more difficult or simply impossible at the same time. Further tranches of support from Poland to Ukraine and the entire West are in doubt. Anyway, you remember perfectly well what Prime Minister Morawiecki said that Poland is now rearming . But back to the topic, the former chief Czesław Mroczek, vice-chairman of the parliamentary defense committee, who will most likely take power with his position, emphasized that decisions on how to further specifically help Ukraine in military matters require knowing the state of its own resources. Poland should act as part of the Ramstein group to support Ukraine in supplying it with military equipment and armament, we should make efforts to increase European Union spending under the European Peace Instrument are very serious measures thanks to which, among other things, we received a refund for the armament provided to Ukraine, Mroczek said in an interview for defence24.pl Therefore, it can be assumed that we will continue to send equipment to Ukrainians, but the opposition's declaration so far shows that these will no longer be such generous supplies because we have nothing left to give. In some time, we will certainly deliver another 30 Mig 29 and other prorad sieck equipment, but with and Solomon will not pour it out, and in the face of Russia's threats, we must also be ready for potential defense. It is also worth mentioning that we do not provide only weapons, but also humanitarian and infrastructural aid. The best proof of this is the fact that Rafał Trzaskowski announced at the beginning of November that Warsaw donated a total of 60 fully functional 81 series wagons that were withdrawn from everyday use with the arrival of new trains, older Warsaw metro trains are already carrying the inhabitants of Kiev, which the mayor of Warsaw shared on his Twitter or, if you prefer, on the x platform, even despite such gestures, considering As currently what bilateral relations look like, returning to the cooperation from the beginning of the conflict may turn out to be impossible, the proof of this is, of course, the Zbożów scandal and the submission of a complaint against Poland to the world trade organization on September 18 this year, the last hot dispute is also the blockade of the Polish-Ukrainian border by truck drivers this conflict turned out to be so crucial that the European Commission is even considering starting a criminal procedure against Poland. According to reports by rmffm journalists in Brussels, Polish drivers have been blocking three border crossings with Ukraine and adjacent roads for over a week, accusing the government of passivity and helplessness in the face of the losses suffered by Polish transport companies due to the need to compete with Ukrainian carriers after the outbreak of the war between Russia and Ukraine Poles are demanding a limit on the number of permits for Ukrainian trucks to enter the European Union, which is of course not agreed to Kiev police still won't let us go so that there won't be any short-circuit between drivers and Ukrainians sometimes come across sporadic cases where a boy's window was broken somewhere, he was just driving somewhere, not exactly. During the Polish-Ukrainian talks on November 13, it was not possible to reach an agreement on this matter, the Ukrainian delegation rejected Polish demands for restoring permits for commercial transport. Poland being one one of the most important transport companies in the European Union is incurring gigantic losses in making the market available to Ukrainian carriers, so far they performed about half of the transport on the Polish-Ukrainian border, currently they are responsible for over 90%, which generates gigantic losses, especially for the inhabitants of Podkarpacie due to the failure of these talks, Polish carriers announce that from November 20 they will begin a blockade of the medical terminal, which may last until January 3, this is a huge threat to interrupting the logistic chain of Ukraine, at the same time leading to significant economic destruction, which may be intensified by the upcoming winter, and the winter beyond our eastern border is already quite severe for the beginning November, the Russians will probably decide to use this moment to further weaken Ukraine. Especially since they have collected over 800 missiles in the annexed Crimea, it is highly probable that all these missiles will be used during the Energy Terror. Ukraine announced that 800 missiles, mainly of the I-caliber caliber, have already been concentrated on the occupied Peninsula. So nothing. It's no wonder that the Kiev authorities, knowing what may happen to them this winter, are trying to improve relations with Warsaw. Włodyki also expressed warm wishes to us on the occasion of Independence Day, informing at the same time how important Polish-Ukrainian cooperation is, especially when the ground is on fire, whether these wishes were sincere. It's hard to say . relations with our neighbors are based, as I said in previous films on the principle of give give give and the number of disputes is increasing An example of which is the current situation in connection with the carriers' protests, an understandable aspect is that the independence of Ukraine It is also important for Poland, but even more important for us Poles is the independence and independence of our homeland Please let us know in the comments what what do you think about curses because I'm curious about yours Thank you for today and until the next material Hold on and keep your fingers crossed for [Music] me and\",\n",

and squeeze it into this tiny little box aboard the lunar module luckily for nasa robert noyce just a couple years earlier invented the planar integrated circuit made from silicon and this is quite literally what blasted the entire silicon valley into the moon at a fairchild semiconductor many employees and founders left to found companies such as intel sandisk and amd and the venture capital fund sequoia and kleiner perkins also came out of fairchild semiconductor all of a sudden we have ourselves a budding ecosystem in addition to that the total population of those who live in silicon valley is just under 40 percent so almost half whereas the national average for the united states is less than 15 so returning back to my previous question what are those elements that you need to start an ecosystem well you need this culture of entrepreneurship you need a high density of highly skilled workers you need a lot of public capital to catalyze the reaction you need a lot of investments into high-tech areas and finally immigration now to really drive my point home here i want to talk about israel so here's a country that's basically an island except being surrounded by water you're surrounded by a bunch of countries that are trying to wipe you off the face of the earth so the israelis had to get creative with how they were going to defend themselves they also had to think fast and act like a startup so when the israelis organized their military they organized it such that it had a horizontal structure and not a vertical structure like almost every other military in the entire world what this did was fostered a culture of entrepreneurship so much so that today for every 1844 citizens in israel there's one startup so we have our culture of entrepreneurship next up for every 10 000 employees there are in israel there's roughly 140 scientists and 135 engineers the most out of any developed society in the entire world so we have our high density of highly skilled workers next up in 1993 israel launched something called the asma group yasma which stands for initiative yazma was responsible for funding its first generation of venture capitalists in the country they provided 40 percent of the total capitalization of a fund and this was in the form of a refundable grant so the investors realized a lot of leverage now this chart i want you to just take a mental note of this chart we're going to use it later but beginning in 1993 yazma started deploying funds to its vc ecosystem and as you can see it went up and to the right and it sustained itself even after the dot-com bust so we have our public capital to catalyze a reaction next up in 1974 intel was looking to create its second headquarters and it decided to pick israel it was instrumental in developing its generation of mobility chips these mobility chips to this day make up half of intel's revenue intel has since invested 10 billion dollars in the country actually more than 10 billion dollars since 1974. then in 1998 cisco decided to build its second headquarters in israel it was responsible for the development of the crs-1 web router this is a very high piece of technology that lives in many data centers and cisco has since invested two billion dollars since 1998 and so we have our large investments into high-tech areas finally in 1990 after the fall of the soviet union roughly 800 000 jews emigrated from the soviet union or the former soviet union back to israel one in three of these individuals had some sort of formal technical training they're either a scientist or an engineer so we have our immigration story but on the other hand we have a place like dubai so dubai arguably has a phenomenal culture of entrepreneurship it has one of the highest immigration rates out of any developed country in the entire world and there's lots of public capital flowing into its ecosystem but it's missing two very important things it's missing a high density of highly skilled workers and because of that companies aren't creating centers of innovation in dubai sure large tech companies have presences in dubai but these are service centers these aren't centers of innovation so if you don't have all five of these elements that doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to have a tech ecosystem so this is very important so the question is is what about poland what's the story here well ironically poland's culture of entrepreneurship stems from the many decades behind the iron curtain because of a centrally planned economy and state enterprises this created economies of shortages in the country long lines like this were not uncommon in those days and i'm sure many of you sitting in this audience have stories from parents or grandparents or other family members about these days here's an article from the new york times 1975 black markets bloom in eastern europe behind facade of straight-laced marxism if you had an old pair of blue jeans and if you're in warsaw you can get up to 70 for that old pair of blue jeans that just gives you an idea of this black market it's estimated that anywhere between 20 to 30 billion dollars annually was the size of the polish black market during that time so we have our culture of entrepreneurship next up we're going to talk about the highly skilled workers here in the country and what better place to start than looking at stem graduates so this is a period between 2013 and 2019 so a seven year period poland produced 761 000 stem graduates in that period so number four in europe even though it's number six in terms of population so this high number isn't simply a function of the population of the country but rather it's a function of the stem graduates per capita now poland is number nine overall in that seven year period in terms of stem graduates per capita but if we want to go beyond the united kingdom we only need to increase this figure by roughly 12 or 14 000 students per year so very very tight race here at the top now the next couple of charts that i want to show you are one of poland's superpowers and that's its women poland is also number four in terms of total stem graduates total female stem graduates at 324 000 but look at this it's number one on a per capita basis and what's even more striking is if we look at the female to male ratio for stem graduates poland's at 43 it's almost half compare this to norway or finland which are 28 and 27 so we have not only our high density of highly skilled workers but we get brownie points for great gender diversity next up we're going to talk a little bit about the public funding situation in poland so there's two vehicles that provide funding to both startups and vcs we have the national center for research and development and pfr specifically pfr ventures pfr is the yazma of poland ncbr since 2016 will have deployed four and a half billion dollars through its fast track and bridge alpha program and pfr will have deployed 750 million dollars if we're going to compare this with yazma that deployed 250 million dollars back in the early 90s pfr alone will have deployed three times as much capital but if we combine this with ncbr it will have been 20 times more capital remember this chart let's zoom in on vc backed startups 1993 was the inflection point here's poland there's our inflection point so poland today is where israel was in 1995. so we have our public capital to catalyze a reaction i'm sure all of you may have heard google just recently announced a massive cloud development center here in the center of warsaw at least 14 floors and is deploying roughly two billion dollars into this project and they're probably doing this because microsoft just a year earlier announced that it was investing a billion dollars also into its azure cloud platform here in poland and finally poland is fighting for an 80 billion dollar prize from intel and this is also in addition to the 3 300 employees that are in gdisk in the north of the country so we have our large investments into high-tech areas finally back in 2014-2015 with the political situation in ukraine roughly two to three million ukrainians emigrated to poland in a five-year span this is one of the largest migrations in the history of europe and also since 2000 as the economic situation is continuing to improve in poland more and more people want to move to poland for economic opportunity so we have our immigration picture but now there's one last thing that i want to bring up that i haven't mentioned at all wasn't part of the five vectors and it's poland's other secret superpower that it has that no other country has in the entire world and that's its diaspora in the 20th century many polls left poland because of the war and because of communism because of that poland has one of if not the largest and most dispersed diaspora in the entire world to put it in the context there's roughly 10 million people of direct polish descent living in the united states and 6 million living in europe that's 42 percent of today's population imagine if we were to repatriate 1.6 million of these individuals back to poland that's four percent of the population [Music] these people would bring back soft skills that would complement a highly skilled workforce here in poland so i go back to my original question does poland have enough of these vectors to sustain and to build a big tech ecosystem i think it does but not only that [Music] i also think poland has an opportunity to not just become any old tech ecosystem but one of the largest tech ecosystems in the world and that's given the fact that we have the largest diaspora in the entire world when the 800 000 jews left the soviet union back in the early 90s and came to israel that was the spark that initiated the israeli tech ecosystem imagine if the same happened for poland so if you're out there right now and you're listening and either you your parents or your grandparents left poland many years ago i want you to consider this as an invitation an invitation to come back an invitation to utilize your skills and apply them to a highly skilled workforce here in poland an invitation to come back and build the largest tech ecosystem the world has ever seen thank you very much [Applause] you\",\n",
       " '- The transcript you’re about to hear, like every single police statement presented in this video, has never been released to the public before. Making this the first and only documentary about the true crime case of Lori Poland, most commonly known as “The Girl in the Hole.” - Brenda, it’s really important that you’re sure. - Kidnapped, abused, and left for dead. 3-year-old Lori Poland was taken in broad daylight. With no evidence in sight, the police had to turn to the neighborhood children and their parents to gather any information that could lead to the capture of the kidnapper and bring Lori back home. - Just bring her back and not hurt her, please. - Trapped 10 feet underground, the little girl was left to fend for herself. But her resilience defied any and all expectations, proving that even at such a young age, she was already a true survivor. - In the small town of Sheridan, Colorado, a tight-knit community where everyone knows each other, 3-year-old Lori Poland was playing in her parents’ front yard with her 5-year-old brother. It was a sunny day right around noon, and many people were out and about enjoying the weather. Her father took the day off to paint their house, but it was very hot outside and the children asked him if they could have a popsicle. There were lots of neighbors around and Lori was with her brother. So Richard Poland, her father, left them alone for a minute to go get them some. Inside, he could still see them through the window until he turned his back and reached for the fridge. - Seconds later, my dad came back outside, just a moment later. He looked at the curb, he looked at my brother, he looked at the curb again. My pants were on the sidewalk. - Richard, frantic about the situation, started to look around his property and went to his neighbors for help. Some reported a car stopping briefly in front of the house but leaving just as quickly, and nobody noticed anything suspicious about Lori’s whereabouts. Distraught, Richard didn’t waste any more time and called the police. - The search for Lori became an immediate concern for the entire community. The police started a massive manhunt, going door to door in the neighborhood, interviewing anyone who had seen something. Word of the missing girl quickly spread and the town came together to help in the search efforts. Flyers were posted all over town and volunteers joined the search parties scouring the nearby woods. The family was devastated, and Diane Poland, Lori’s mother, made an emotional plea to the kidnapper begging for the safe return of her daughter. - A desperate plea from the mother of Lori Poland. - Just bring her back. - It was the prototypal abduction, before Stranger Danger. Before Amber alerts, before social media, there was almost no prevention being done by the government in regard to kidnapping and child abuse in 1983. - So in 1983, it was more of a crime to cause harm to an animal than it was to a child. So you had a larger sentence if you hurt an animal or killed an animal than if you did it to a small child. - This is how it all happened from Lori’s perspective. The kidnapper parked in front of the house in a hurry and opened his passenger door. The man offered her some candy, and she, being only three years old, was easily lured by the treat. - When he pulls up, he asks if I like candy, and like any sugar-loving 3-year-old, I’m like, “Dude, yeah.” - He forced her to take her pants off, snatched her, and was gone in a moment’s notice. The kidnapper was well aware of the danger he had placed himself in by committing such a brazen crime in a well-populated area. - In the middle of the summer, it was middle of the day, just a really bold move. - He knew that he had to put as much distance as possible between himself and the town in order to evade the police. This led him to drive recklessly, careening down mountain roads and twisting through the forested countryside. - He took me to the mountains in Colorado about 20 miles west of Denver, and then he took me up to Chief Hosa exit up by 70. - Finally, he arrived at an old abandoned outhouse set back deep into the woods. She didn’t know it yet, but this was to be Lori’s prison for the foreseeable future, but not before the kidnapper had his way with her. - He proceeded to severely abuse me and do a lot of pretty horrific things to me like... - Out of respect for Lori, who was only a toddler at the time, we won’t cover any more of the assault as it is extremely graphic. When he was done, her kidnapper lifted her up and with a cruel and heartless gesture, dropped her down the outhouse’s 10-foot-deep toilet right into the latrine pit. There was no way for her to see, but she could feel something was wrong with her foot after crashing down at the bottom. There, she was trapped in the dark, surrounded by filth and chemical-laced ice-cold water. The sound of the door slamming shut echoed in her mind as she started to cry in fear and pain. She had just been left to die underground. - Lori was taken while she was playing outside her home. - Without reliance on Amber alerts or the internet, the parents turned to mainstream media to try and locate their daughter. On the first day of her disappearance, both Diane and Richard appeared on TV. They shared their story, expressing their concerns, and pleading for anyone with information to come forward. Luckily, many neighbors contacted the police. One eyewitness, Paul Weaver, was particularly observant, recalling crucial details about the car involved in Lori’s kidnapping. - On the same day, another witness, Michael R. Fisher, also came forward with important information. His children reportedly had a concerning encounter with a suspicious man a week prior. - With a description of the car and details regarding the kidnapper’s physical appearance, the police were in a good position to find the culprit. There was still hope the little girl was alive, but on that matter, they had nothing. Absolutely zero information regarding her location nor anything that could lead them there. - What happened on August 22, 1983 completely stopped the entire community of Colorado. - Down the hole, Lori somehow knew there was something wrong with the water. In total darkness, she could only rely on her sense of touch and smell to tell apart her surroundings. But these two were enough for her to understand that she should stay as far away as she could from the sludge. There was some sort of mound of wood and rubble over the murky water, so she stuck to it, flattening it with her arms, turning it into a kind of seat. It is at this moment that Lori recalled a memory of her mom for a second. - And I had just turned three and I had just gotten potty trained and I had to go to the bathroom, and I was so worried that I was gonna let my mom down. - Lori’s worries may seem trivial now, but what she didn’t know was that right above her head, years of untreated methane gas and hydrogen sulfide had accumulated in the upper layer of the pit. If she were to stand up even for a minute, she would probably pass out, fall down the mound, and drown in the water. And the same was true for the underlying sludge. She would risk severe infection if her wounded legs came into contact with it. But even if the little girl knew better, the mound was very small and there was no way she could fit her entire body onto it. And so Lori let her legs hang with her toes sometimes coming into contact with the surface of the water. - And he left me there. And he left me there to starve to death. He left me there for dead. - The following day, the police still had nothing concerning Lori, but were closing in on the culprit’s identity. Investigators coming directly from the FBI joined the local police and started going door to door all around Denver in hopes of finding more information about the mysterious missing letters on the kidnapper’s license plate. And against all odds, they struck gold when they bumped into Wuanita Zappa, a grandmother living in an adjacent town. - And right there, they had a match. After running the plate, they associated it with Robert Paul Thiret, a local golf club groundskeeper with no criminal record. They tried to get to him, but the man wasn’t home at the time and the police had no time to waste. So they went for the closest relative they could get their hands on, his mother. - The police didn’t let that statement linger. Instead, they went directly to the facts. Robert and his car had been identified in three separate incidents, and in all of them, he offered children candies and asked them to take their pants off, including Lori Poland. These words resonated loudly in the room before Betty Ann continued her statement. - An unknown amount of time later, Lori’s young mind was starting to fail her. She couldn’t discern night from day as minutes lasted like hours, while the pain from her now heavily infected legs kept her awake at all times. - The chemicals that were in this toilet made it up into my pelvis. My legs were completely black all the way up to my upper thigh. - But as much as the underground seemed depressive to her, it was also her salvation. The biting cold of the latrine was nothing compared to the nighttime temperatures in the Colorado mountains. If she had been left in the forest, she wouldn’t have lasted more than a night naked in the cold, but down the pit, she managed to survive four days straight without food or water. - I was starving to death. That’s torture. - She couldn’t see them, but her legs were almost black with infection, and her time was running out. With only a few hours left to live, Lori tried to reminisce about her mother, but her memory was blurry at best. How long had she been down there? Days, weeks, months. And suddenly, one clear memory came back. She remembered her mother’s face congratulating her for something  she did only a few days back. But the recollection slipped from her mind almost as fast as it came in. Now all she could hear was the echo of her own cries amplified by her buzzing fever and nothing else. Not even the door slamming up top nor the scream of the disturbed couple who happened to find her down at the bottom of the pit. - I was crying, crying for my mom. And bird watchers happened to be driving by. - Cynthia and Steven Gaulin, a couple of bird watchers, were heading out to the mountain for a hike. On their way, Cynthia said she needed to go to the bathroom so her husband turned towards the Beaver Hook trail head, remembering the old camper amenities there. As she walked in, Cynthia heard an unexpected sound. It’s hard to imagine the horror she must have felt when she heard the desperate cries of a little girl coming down from the latrine. Cynthia looked down the hole only to see the reflection of the dim light in the tearful eyes of the child. - And so eventually, they looked down and they said, “What are you doing here?” And I told them that I lived there. And so for me, it was my new normal, I literally thought I lived in the bottom of a toilet. - Steven Baker, a volunteer firefighter, was called to the scene. Once he reached the bottom, he was able to locate the girl and checked her condition. Despite being trapped in the pit for several days without food or water, Lori was still conscious, but her legs were in very bad shape. Steven gently lifted her out of the mound and secured her onto his harness. When they reached the top, Lori was immediately sent to the hospital. Diane, Lori’s overjoyed mother, followed right behind. Once there, the situation was dire, as her mental state went from bad to worse. She was stuck in a disassociative state, suffered insomnia induced waking nightmares, and she was absolutely terrorized by everyone, even her own parents. - Capturing the terror and relief only her parents could feel. - But their reunion was cut short as doctors were faced with a difficult decision. - Her heart, lungs, and brain were failing. Her fingers, feet, and toes were turning black. - The infection was rapidly spreading, and amputation seemed to be the only option to save Lori’s life. But over the course of only a few days, the child’s condition improved dramatically. And miraculously, she was able to keep both of her legs. When she was better, Lori was finally reunited with her parents for good. Tears streamed down Diane’s face. It had been four long, agonizing days since her daughter had been taken from her, but against all odds, they were finally together. - But sadly, their ordeal was far from being over. After the police finally got their hands on Robert Paul Thiret, they turned to young Lori for information. She was asked to make a detailed statement on events her mind had already began to repress. - Dr. Richard Krugman was Lori’s pediatrician at the time at the Kemp Center and shot video of this interview. - As you can probably guess, this was not only traumatic, but also very demanding for such a young child. Then Lori was tasked with identifying her attacker from a row of people. - She was rock solid in her identification. Her body language said, “Mommy, that’s him.” And she sort of reeled back. She was a little scared. - Closing in on the trial, Robert’s wife provided him with a forged alibi. This led the prosecution to believe that Robert might get away with it if he chose to stick with his non-guilty defense. This forced the judge to take a controversial decision. He offered Robert a diminishing plea deal. - He was then sentenced to 10 years in prison. - Instead of being charged with kidnapping, attempted murder, and sexual abuse, all charges were dropped except sexual abuse. This reduced his sentence from 48 years to only 10 years. - And so he was sentenced to 10 years in prison and was released after six for good behavior. - The public was outraged by the reduced sentence. Since the impact of these events on Lori’s life had been long-lasting and profound, she experienced a range of psychological and emotional problems such as depression, anxiety, and PTSD. She also struggled with trust issues and self-esteem problems as she grew up, but proper support and care, like counseling and therapy, helped her cope with the trauma and heal from the abuse in the long run. And now that she’s an adult, Lori sees it from a completely different perspective. - Do you feel like justice was served? - For me, it’s not really about justice. It’s more about being impactful. And every day, I wake up and I just try and be impactful and try and be good in the world and prevent people from growing up and causing harm. - Justice does not help with PTSD. Justice doesn’t stop the nightmares. Justice doesn’t actually help the sufferer. And so I think for Lori and her story, her desire to understand the perpetrator, that actually relieves some of the pain. That allows her to develop context that she did not have at three years old and could not have had. So understanding becomes crucial for her to be free from the silent suffering that nobody else will ever see or know. Justice is for the witnesses more than it is for the victim. - To this day, the ripple effects of what happened continue. But Lori Poland, now a mother of three, has never backed away from a fight, not only for herself, but now for all children who have been abused. - Today, she operates her own therapy practice and works alongside pediatrician, Dr. Richard Krugman, who helped her through her own trauma decades ago as the co-founder of the End Child Abuse and Neglect Association, or ENDCAN. Lori’s work with the association has shown her that abuse is often part of a cycle of violence, with victims on both sides, as most sex offenders have a history of being abused in their own childhood. Robert Paul Thiret’s past demonstrates this, as he was abused as a child, starting at age three, the same age Lori was when he kidnapped her. - Imagine, I’ve sat in a room with 250 sex offenders who’ve shared for the first time in their lives their own lived experience of being harmed, and how that created this anger inside of them to then amplify them causing harm. Again, not to excuse it, not to justify it, but to understand it. - Instead of seeking punishment and justice, Lori’s mission is to promote healing and understanding, recognizing that every person involved in abuse needs support and care to heal and move forward. Her story is truly a beacon of hope, inspiring others to turn their suffering into strength and to use their experiences to make a positive impact on the world. She wants all victims of abuse and neglect to know that their voices will always be louder than silence. - I’ve never met a human, no matter how atrocious their crime, that their primary need is not to matter. It’s up to us to do the right thing. If we, instead of getting angry, had some semblance of understanding, not excusing, but understanding that those people matter, imagine the changes. If we ensured that every human felt like they mattered.',\n",
       " \"These latest strikes come amid a dramatic downward spiral in relations between Ukraine and one of its biggest supporters, NATO, Poland. What began as a dispute over Ukrainian grain imports has quickly escalated in recent days, with Poland's prime minister announcing late Wednesday an end to supplying weapons to Ukraine and a focus instead on arming its own defense forces. Poland and four other neighboring countries issued a ban on Ukrainian grain imports after farmers complained of a slump in prices caused by the increased grain supply. France has sided with Ukraine and called the move unjustified. And the European Council president, Charles Michel says EU support, though, for Ukraine remains steadfast. The EU intends to support Ukraine for its logistics. Ukraine's crime scene and there is a criminal and it's extremely important to make sure that there would be no impunity There also appears to be signs of growing divisions in the US Congress over continued backing of Ukraine, with opinion polls showing a lack of support for Ukraine among Americans. A growing number of Republican lawmakers are threatening to end funding, a position supported by most Republican presidential hopefuls. The US president, though, has promised Ukrainians they won't face Russia alone and has called for global unity to end the war. And that commitment will be on display Thursday at the White House with an announcement of another round of military assistance during a visit by the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. For all his scenes, Kayla Telsey When Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky visits the White House, the U.S. is prepared to unveil a new security package, including artillery anti-armor antimissile and significant air defense capabilities that officials say will help the country ramp up its counter offensive, as well as protect its skies with an expectation that strikes on critical infrastructure will increase. As the weather grows colder. But a U.S. official tells me that deep strike missiles known as attack arms are not expected in this new security drawdown. John Kirby, a top national security official, told reporters that government agencies are still weighing the possibility of sending these weapons to Ukraine. The military in the U.S., however, believes that they're less critical for a successful counter offensive than, say, vehicles and mine clearing equipment that can breach Russian troops on the ground. But it all comes as Zelensky prepares his pitch for skeptics in the US Congress who are weighing whether to greenlight tens of billions of dollars in more aid. Zelensky tells CNN that his pitch to them will be We are near the finish line. I am sure of it. Kayla tells CNN, traveling with the president in New York Barbara Walter is a permanent member of the Council on Foreign Relations, professor of international relations at the University of California, San Diego, and a world renowned expert on how conflicts begin and how they also end. And it's been a while. It's good to see you. It's great to be here. Thank you. Okay. So one way this war could also end is by division and that division within NATO. And that brings us to this decision by Poland to end supplying weapons to Ukraine. This comes amid a dispute over Ukrainian grain farmers in Poland are blaming the imports for a slump in prices. So how significant is this rift right now between Kiev and Warsaw, not just in the impact on the battlefield which seems minimal, but the overall bigger impact of what appears to be some very serious cracks? I think this is actually just a temporary rift and it's temporary because I think it's purely political. Poland has an election next month. Currently, there is a right wing party in power a populist party. The farmers are very important for that party to stay in power and to win the elections next month. And populist voters also tend to be kind of the first voters, Poland first or America first. And so it's a smart political move on some levels for the prime minister to pull back in this month before the elections, to say that we're going to take care of Poland's defense first. To say that we're not going to buy Ukrainian grain, instead we're going to buy we're going to continue to buy Polish green and make the farmers happy. So I think this is a political move that's not going to have long standing consequences. Okay. Well, the French foreign minister, for one, says that this decision by Poland was unjustified citing an EU study which found that Ukrainian grain did not distort local prices. His Katerina Colada. Listen to this. In. There is no market upheaval and there are perhaps internal political considerations on the part of some of our partners, which unfortunately pushes them to have this position that nothing justifies it. So the opinion there from the French foreign minister was essentially that, you know, this is sort of internal politics in Poland coming out to play. But there are other European countries siding with Poland over this issue. But then this also brings us to a division within the United States. And while the White House plans to provide Ukraine with new aid during Zelensky's visit on Thursday, there's a good number of Republicans balking at continued support for Ukraine and divisions among European nations growing divisions in the US Congress. It may not be the start of the crack, but it's just heading in the direction that Putin has been hoping for Of course, every every day, every month that the West doesn't continue to support Ukraine either by buying grain or sending additional resources and and munitions is going to hurt Ukraine. And Ukraine needs all the help that it can get. What's happening here in the United States is in some ways similar to what's happening in Poland. Americans are divided based on party. 71% of Republicans do not support continuing to say to send aid to Ukraine. About 62% of Democrats want to continue to to support Ukraine. So there's very much a divide. And again, the divide is the result of of what different people think about how the US should be spending its money. Republicans increasingly think we should be spending on the United States America first. Why should we be sending our money to a country that's that's far away? Whereas Democrats believe that supporting Ukraine and defeating Russian aggression is important not only for US security, but for the security of our allies and the world as well. And in part one of the reasons this war has dragged on for so long is because Russia has used its veto to block any attempt at the UN Security Council to intervene. So with that in mind, here's the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken. For over a year and a half. Russia has shredded the major tenets of the United Nations Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Humanitarian Law, and flouted one Security Council resolution after another. It's hard to imagine a country demonstrating more contempt for the United Nations in all that it stands for this from a country with a permanent seat on this council. And just moments ago, we also heard from the Ukrainian president saying that, you know, this war cannot end while Russia has that veto power on the Security Council. Is he right? Well, the war can end in lots of different ways. The war could end by Russia being defeated, Ukraine being defeated, or both sides agreeing to some sort of negotiated settlement. The U.N. is not going to really have very much influence in how this war ends in large part because Russia is not going to agree to any new and action that's going to hurt Russia in any way. And that's just not going to change People like to think about the United Nations as having independent power. They like to think of it as an organization that can can act in the in the best interest of all countries in the world and certainly can act against an aggressor and a country that's committing war crimes. But the reality is, is the U.N. is just an organization made up of member countries. And most of the power is in the hands of five countries. And one of those countries is Russia. And Russia is not going to give up that power. And the U.N. is not going to change the system because it benefits those five countries.\",\n",

Dla wielu Amerykanów genealogia\\nto wielki podbój i często jedyny powód, dla którego przyjeżdżają do\\nPolski w pierwszej kolejności. Takich opowieści jest bez liku. Spotkałem się więc z ekspertem, aby dowiedzieć się więcej o procesie odkrywania swoich korzeni. Genealogia jest bardzo ważna, ponieważ pomaga nam uhonorować naszych przodków, zachować pamięć o nich. Na naszych warsztatach zawsze powtarzamy, że gdyby nie oni, nie byłoby nas tutaj. Czy możesz mi podać najważniejsze kroki, które należy podjąć, jeśli chcemy odkryć historię swojej rodziny lub genealogię? Przede wszystkim musimy sprawdzić: co mamy w domu, bo każdy\\nma swoje rodzinne archiwum, związane zwłaszcza z imionami,\\nnazwiskami, nazwiskami panieńskimi, informacjami o datach, a gdy już zbierzesz wszystkie te informacje, możesz skorzystać baz danych online. Potem musisz skupić się na\\nznalezieniu swojej rodzinnej parafii, do której należała wieś twoich\\nprzodków, w której tam mieszkali. Czy uważasz, że dzieci polskich imigrantów, które przedostały się do Stanów Zjednoczonych, są w rzeczywistości Polakami? Jestem pewiena, że nasze pochodzenie nie jest związane tylko z naszymi rodzicami czy dziadkami, udowodnili to naukowcy, historia,\\nwszystko, co widzimy. Każdy człowiek jest związany\\nz jakąś określoną kulturą, regionem świata. Wierzę, że każdy, kto wyemigrował z Polski, ale ma swoje korzenie tutaj, może zdecydowanie uważać się za Polaka, ponieważ to dziedzictwo wiąże\\nsię z naprawdę długą historią. A jako pierwszy przystanek podczas wizyty - polecam muzeum regionalne, które jest solidnym fundamentem\\ndo zrozumienia lokalnej historii. Tego typu wystawa jest bezcenna, ponieważ pozwala z pierwszej ręki zobaczyć, jak żyli tu ludzie na przestrzeni wieków. Na przykład na początku XIX wieku była jedna bardzo odmienna praktyka, która była obserwowana podczas posiłków. Był to fakt, że rodzina dzieliła się\\njedzeniem z jednej gigantycznej miski. To było jakby prezentowane na stole, a jedzenie było dalej rozdzielane. Jej przykład jest za mną. Wzrusza mnie to, że jest on inkrustowany sztuką ludową, za którą kochamy ten region, a przecież był to element\\nzwykłego rodzinnego domu. Kolejnym nieoczekiwanym rzemiosłem, które funkcjonowało w Nowym Targu, było tworzenie kapeluszy.\\nProces był prosty, ale wymagał pewnego kunsztu. Producent czapek zaczynał od założenia kapelusza na tę większą\\nformę w kształcie piłki nożnej i stopniowo zwijając go w kształt, który pasowałby do ludzkiej głowy. Tworzono tu specyficzne kapelusze\\ndla różnych grup społecznych, od chłopów do wyższych sfer, a nawet\\nżydowskich mieszkańców Nowego Targu. Setki lat temu był to ważny szlak handlowy - stąd nazwa Nowy Targ - w języku angielskim New Market. Transportowano tu produkty\\nod soli po węgiel, czy wino. I jak widać po tej wymyślnej grafice z boku, kupcy nie tylko prowadzili\\ninteresy, ale także ozdabiali. Nowy Targ jako serce Podhala oferuje wiele ciekawych dróg do przemierzenia - jedna z nich doprowadziła mnie do\\nniezapomnianego zabytku z listy UNESCO. Spędziłem trochę czasu rozmawiając\\nz lokalnymi mieszkańcami i stwierdziłem, że mamy dużą\\nróżnicę patrząc na ten pomnik. Dla mnie to skarb dla ludzkości, dla nich to wyjątkowa, ale nieco zwyczajna przestrzeń, w której na co dzień się spotykają.\\nŁączy ich jako społeczność. Służy jednak jednemu wyższemu celowi: niedaleko stąd jest sztuczne jezioro, a ta pani, z którą rozmawiałem, kiedyś mieszkała w wiosce, która istniała,\\nw miejscu dzisiejszego jeziora. Plany dotyczące tego jeziora rozciągnęły się na tę wioskę. Jednak wioska została uratowana dzięki temu\\nniesamowitemu, historycznemu artefaktowi. Więc to jest powód, dla którego się tu przeprowadzili,\\nale jest to również powód, dla którego istniała wioska,\\ndo której można się było przenieść. Szyny kolejowe historycznie stanowiły istotne połączenie z tym obszarem, a jeśli przyjeżdżasz, aby studiować historię rodziny - warto zauważyć, że ta forma transportu służyła jako dosłowny element drogi, którą przebywali przodkowie i matki w drodze do nowego świata. Do Nowego Targu nadal można dojechać pociągiem. Można też oglądać te relikty przeszłości w ciszy. To muzeum ma szeroką gamę wystaw, od lokomotyw parowych po dieslowe, elektryczne, pługi i dźwigi. Wydaje się, że ma coś, co zainteresowałoby wszystkich. Muszę przyznać, że poza ciekawą historią, której można się tutaj nauczyć, Nowy Targ oferuje mi też coś, co uważam za bezcenne jako podróżnik, patrzący na Europę oczami Amerykanina. I to jest doświadczenie jak w Disneylandzie. Mam na myśli w najbardziej pochlebnym sensie. Widzicie obrazy, które znamy o Europie, pochodzą z mediów, z książek historycznych, często przedstawiających podróże\\nw czasach romansu lub wojny, pojazdami, które mnie tu otaczają. Dziś stoją nadal i naprawdę łączą Cię z wyobrażeniem Europy, którą miałeś nadzieję znaleźć. Zbudowane na miejscu dawnej parowozowni w Chabówce, muzeum słynie z licznych i ciekawych wystaw związanych z historią kolejnictwa w Polsce. Na koniec należy odnieść się do faktu, że Nowy Targ to miasto położone w centrum jednych z najlepszych\\nrekreacji na świecie. Chciałbym zaoferować jedno z takich miejsc niedaleko miasta - o nazwie Szaflary - bardzo przeoczany klejnot. Pod koniec lat 90. i na początku XXI wieku Polacy zwykle podróżowali na Słowację, aby korzystać z termalnych basenów mineralnych. Wszystko zmieniło się w 2008 roku, kiedy do gry weszły Szaflary - miasteczko oddalone o rzut\\nkamieniem od Nowego Targu, gdzie założono pierwszy basen w okolicy. Chociaż do wyboru jest kilka, dziś odwiedzimy oryginalne miejsce. Te cztery baseny zawierają wysoko\\nzmineralizowaną wodę termalną. Woda jest faktycznie schładzana do temperatury od 30 do 38 stopni Celsjusza. Wydobywana jest z głębokości 3000 metrów. Poza tym wody te różnią się od innych\\nwystępujących w Polsce i zawierają ogromne ilości potasu, sodu, magnezu, wapnia, żelaza i siarki. W związku z tym dostępny jest tutaj szeroki zakres\\nterapii i zabiegów leczniczych. Niektórzy twierdzą, że te wody\\npomagają w utracie wagi, ciśnieniu krwi, problemach z krążeniem, zmęczeniu, stresie i odnalezieniu\\nwewnętrznego spokoju. Uważam, że prawdziwym powodem, dla którego ktoś by tu przyjechał, jest obcowanie z folklorem i magią Podhala - jednego z najbardziej znanych\\nmiejsc w Polsce. Oczywiście wszyscy skłaniają się ku Zakopanemu, a Zakopane jest cudowne. Jest ciekawe, interesujące i bardzo wygodne, ale też bardzo komercyjne. Dlatego w drodze do tego komercyjnego miejsca, gorąco polecam zatrzymanie się\\nw miastach takich jak Nowy Targ, aby zobaczyć, jak żyją dziś prawdziwi\\ngóralscy ludzie w 2020 roku. A do tego czasu jestem\\nRyan Socash for Poland In.',\n",
       " \"Compared to the\\n rest of Europe, Polish churches are alive with \\npeople practicing their faith. Respectful tourists\\nare welcome. Some come to worship and others \\nto remember leading figures in Polish history, such\\n as Kazimierz the Great. If you're going to remember\\none Polish king, remember Kazimierz the Great, who ruled Poland from Krakow\\nin the 14th century. Kazimierz was one of those\\nlarger-than-life medieval kings who left his mark\\non all fronts. He was a great warrior,\\ndiplomat, patron of the arts,\\nand womanizer. His scribes bragged Kazimierz\\n found Poland made of wood and left it\\n made of brick and stone. He even made it\\n onto the 50 zloty note. Most of all,\\nKazimierz was remembered for being a tolerant\\nand progressive king. In the 14th century, when other\\nnations were deporting Jews, King Kazimierz\\nactively welcomed them. He granted them special banking\\nand trading privileges and established\\nthe long-standing tradition of Poland being a safe haven\\nfor Jews in Europe. The neighborhood of Kazimierz, \\nnamed for the king, was a thriving and autonomous \\nJewish community for centuries when most of the world's\\n Jews lived here in Poland. In the 1930s, a quarter of \\nKrakow's population was Jewish. While few Jews\\n actually still live here, the spirit of the Jewish\\ntradition survives. Perhaps the best way\\n to enjoy that is at a Klezmer\\ndinner concert. [ Lively music playing ] Several restaurants\\n offer Jewish music from 19th-century Poland with\\n their traditional cuisine. As Polish and Jewish culture\\nmingled here for so many centuries,\\n it's hard to distinguish between Jewish\\nand Polish cuisine. But with ambiance\\n like this, it's clear that Jewish\\nheritage here is a rich one. [ Applause ] While Poles and Jews managed to\\nlive together relatively well, the story became a nightmare with the rise of Nazism\\nin the 1930s. This thriving Jewish community,\\nlike most in Europe, was decimated\\nduring the Holocaust. The fragile remains\\n of the community, historic exhibits\\n and its synagogues provide a meditative look at\\n how the town was walled in and its residents\\n eventually shipped off to nearby\\nconcentration camps. Ultimately, less than 10%\\n of Krakow's Jews survived the war\\nand the death camps. The Jewish cemeteries\\nof Kazimierz were defiled by the Germans,\\n bulldozed by Nazi tanks. Headstones,\\n broken under tank treads, now create a moving mosaic\\nwall and Holocaust monument.\",\n",
       " 'The main purpose of many people to visit Krakow is...\\nDrinking and Partying hard. Because alcohol is so cheap here. Here is a wine shop. Let\\'s go inside and checkout the prices. Women in Poland are so beautiful and there are so many women in Krakow. We have just arrived Budapest. The capital city of Hungary. Hello everyone, welcome to another new video. I am in Krakow, which is a city in Poland. The capital of Poland is Warsaw but... there are many other cities like Lords, Krakow, where I am right now. Here is my hotel where I am staying. We\\'ll have a coffee and then we will go to explore the city. This is my friend Vikram. We have to take care of mask here because we had arrived here from Prague. There is a mall on the left and a bus stop behind it.\\nYou can see that. When we arrived to that bus stop, 2 cops came to us immediately. Vikram did\\'t wear his mask properly. So, they just gave us a warning and left away. Otherwise we were not asked for any covid report or vaccination certificate. So it happens, they are lenient and don\\'t mind so much. You might know that Poland is the 9th largest country of Europe. And... it is cheaper than many other countries. In fact Krakow is very cheap than other cities and it\\'s like heaven for the alcohol lovers. And our hotel is also like a 5 Start hotel. It costs us 3500 bucks. And it is very nice. If you compare from other places, you might not get even a sharing room in Paris at this price. And... Krakow is a big city in Poland where we have got this hotel. Temperatue is around -5° to -6° in the day. The time is around 2 PM. Luckily the weather is nice today because the sun is up. Otherwise we haven\\'t seen sunlight in Europe since last 4-5 days. So it feels nice that... we have got some heat. This is a very nice thing in Europe that they give priority to pedestrians. Recently we were crossing the road and there was a taxi driver. We were so far from the zebra crossing and he was almost there. But he just stopped there only and allowed us to cross the road. We crossed the road. e could pass first but he kept waiting due to us for almost 40-50 seconds. And that is so pleasing. You can take these scooters on rent. Install their app and use the code to unlock. Then you can pay and enjoy the ride of the whole town. So now we are going to old town. Old town of Krakow, where you will find mostly cafes, bars, and party places. I am going there for the first time, in Poland. Poland was affected a lot during World War 2. Means this old town is not actually old town because... most of the building were bombed during World War 2. I\\'m sure about Warsaw that almost all the buildings of old town have been reconstructed. But can\\'t tell about Krakow. Some countries like Czech Republic, Prague. All the castle in Prague are intact. They were not bombed during World War 2. But if we talk about Poland, it\\'s buildings were affected. We have reached near the Krakow Old Town. It\\'s about 600-700 m away from here. You will hear that it is the oldest part of the city. But most of the buildings have been reconstructed. Like you can see this building is also looking old. But I\\'m pretty sure it was not like this before World War 2. So let\\'s talk about Poland. As I have told you that it\\'s the 9th largest country of Europe. If we talk about ethnicity, most of the people here are Polish population. Most of the people are Christian in religion. Almost 90% and in Christian, most of them are Catholic. The population of Poland is around 40 million. And if we talk about language, people speak Polish here and I found it very similar to Russian. And many young people here can speak English also. I think this is the main square of Old town. This is a church and the place has so much crowd. Christmas tree is decorated but Christmas has passed. The main purpose of many people to visit Krakow is...\\nDrinking and Partying hard because alcohol is very cheap here. And if you don\\'t know, let me tell you that Vodka was invented in Poland. Many of you might think that it was invented in Russia or Finland. But actually Vodka was invented in Poland. I am wearing a glove in the hand from which I am recording but nothing in this hand. And it\\'s numb now. Women in Poland are so beautiful and there are so many women in Krakow. So everybody has these 2 motives. Alcohol, and Girls.\\nVikram, what about you? Wandering with you and falling into the pit. Really! Is that so? This road reminds me of Moscow. The road near red square looks almost similar to this. And people keep walking there like this. Just like Moscow. Here is a wine shop. Let\\'s go inside and checkout the prices. \"zl\" means Polaish złoty, which is the currency here. 1 Polish złoty equals around 18 Indian Rupees average. If you multiply 3.69 with 18, this beer cost around 66 INR. This beer costs around 50-55 INR. And these are small point beers. Beer is available at these prices here. Point beer and large one. And this is flavored, I think. Fruit flavored for 3.79 zl. Means 60-70 INR. Here we will get Wine, Vodka, Whisky.\\nLet\\'s check the price of Wines. I have not much knowledge of Wines. But this is most probably Red wine. 500 ml 34 Polish złoty, that means around 500-600 INR. This is for 19.99 zl. 750 ml for around 350 INR. This Martini and all other bottles are very cheap in price for us. This is nice that you can get dairy products also in the wine shop here. Like milk, yogurt, cheese, etc. All these available at wine shop. So it\\'s very nice that milk and alcohol both are available at same place. Hi! Today I\\'m going to introduce you to a Forex trading platform named \"Pocket Option\". Pocket option was found in 2017 and today... they continue to develop, improve, and constantly innovating trading experience. Pocket option has more than 100K active users.

And I wanted to try something new today from Poland. So, this is a flavored drink and it has 25% alcohol. See... 200 ml drink. It means 50 ml is alcohol in it. And this is a flavored drink. So I purchased 2 bottles of this and 2 chocolates. Total bill was 33 Polish złoty. This was a costly drink that\\'s why the bill amount is high. This costs around 250 INR. Or may be lesser. The others were cheaper like in 50 INR also... I saw a large beer. It\\'s not so good. Just normal with the taste of fruits. It seems like they have mixed Vodka in fruit juice. So I thought it is overpriced. Krakow is known for nightlife. So I thought I should make a video in the day time. I might not shoot video of nightlife due to darkness. But I don\\'t think there is something interesting to show you in the day. As the sun is about to set, We see people are coming. And this place was empty in the morning. So I\\'m pretty sure that people come here mostly in the night time. India...\\nWooo... So today is the second day in Krakow, Poland. I stopped the video yesterday. And right now we are at Burger King. And... We ordered food because we have to catch a bus in the next 30 minutes for Budapest, Hungary. So we have to go fast to reach the platform. This is the bus stop of Krakow. I\\'ll show you after going outside. The bill for the food is 47 Polish złoty. and it is equal to around 900 INR... which includes fries, a long chicken burger, vegetarian burger. Many people are turning vegan, so Burger King also started offering these options. This was not available earlier in McDonalds or Burger King. And this is a cold drink. These all cost 900 INR. But it\\'s okay. Not so costly as compared to many other options. That is our bus to Budapest. That is about to leave within a few minutes. We\\'ve reached at right time. This is a flix bus. Not double decker. Here is a washroom. These are passengers and this is the bus stop. It\\'s almost vacant. This is a village between the border of Poland and Slovakia. First we will enter Slovakia and then after crossing the border, we will reach Hungary. Look A few minutes earlier, there was traffic jam. But that road was fine. But nobody crossed the lane to enter that road. And the jam was cleared easily. This was a good thing. We have just arrived Budapest. The capital city of Hungary. This is the bus stop. Actually we had 2 bus stops. The bus stopped to the other stop before this. Both are at almost same distance from city center. This takes 13 minutes and that one takes around 10 minutes. So we thought that... we will travel to the next stop in the bus and see the places in the city. So we have booked hotel. It\\'s a hostel and we have taken a private room there. The reason is that we have arrived so late. And hostels have a good and lively atmosphere. This doesn\\'t happen in Hotels. So we will move to hostel now and eat something. Then I will update everything before sleeping. Firstly, let\\'s get away from here. Bye... This is our hostel. I have taken a private room here. So let\\'s get in. Here is a coffee machine, this is the common area, and that is a bar counter. And wherever we are seeing, people are having drinks. It means people consume alcohol a lot here. Let\\'s take some coffee. So we are sitting in the waiting area because the work shift of the staff is changing right now. So they asked us to wait for 10-15 minutes. then they will take us to the room. But anyways... I didn\\'t capture Poland a lot in my video, Krakow... because it was so cold at that time. You have noticed we have reached Budapest directly after yesterday\\'s video. It was so sold, around -5° or -6° was the temperature. It was hard to record the video at that time. So we returned back to the hotel. Then we went to Pub Crawl at night and an event was happening there.  I know you are so curios about the nightlife of Krakow. So I had put stories on Instagram. You might have seen. I\\'ll put them in highlights, you can visit to my account and see them. And if I talk about drinks, it was really cheap. One beer or any other drinks were available in 10-12 Polish złoty in the Pub. That means you will get a large glass of beer under 200 INR. Other drinks are also available under 200-250 INR. I told you the estimate in that wine shop about the prices. The light were dim in the club so we couldn\\'t record the video. And... we came back very early. Because it was very cold last night. So that\\'s it. Now we will check-in into a room of this hostel in Budapest and then eat something. People say that Budapest is also cheap if you compare it from Western Europe, and Central Europe. So we don\\'t have any special plans here right now. We will have some light food. And will see a restaurant, pub, cafe etc. from outside only. So this is the hostel room. The room number is 005. The room number is not written on the gate. They told us to enter into the corner room. We found it somehow. I was confused so I went to the reception again. I saw online reviews which were good and that\\'s why I booked it. But it\\'s fine. The bathroom is very spacious. At reception also, they asked us to wait for 15 minutes because the cashier was changing the duty. And they took 50-60 minutes. Wasted so much time. I personally didn\\'t like their service. \"a&o hostels\" is the name of the hostel. It was not a good experience. But it\\'s okay, we have to stay here tonight only. So let\\'s sleep and... finish the video because there\\'s nothing special to show you. Let\\'s see something better in Budapest tomorrow. Anyways, I hope you like the video. Thank you so much for watching.\\nGood bye...',\n",

       " \"Peter pill Travelers Mark here with [walter] [sterling] today. We're the main square here in Krakow Poland beautiful cities Definitely worth checking out and today We have for you are the [10] things that Shocked tourists when they come here to poland and the first thing that shocked people when they come to poland is The Polish Faith the Polish look when you come here, you'll notice that people walk around Like this just there's no motion. It's not happy it's not [sad]. It's just neutral It's funny because you [see] it anywhere looking the train station you going out to eat you're going to the stores You're going all over the place. They just have the same look Okay, it's like wait a minute kitchen Be happy or sad [or] something up they have it's like dead on look which works really well because you'll see the women here are Gorgeous okay, and when you see them longer. Oh, they're just preparing for their supermodel career because when you're on the Catwalk You don't show any emotion so they actually works really well, but it is kind of funny How the people you know you do have this? Look, and that's the first thing I shock people also kind of going along with the people you might be shocked at look the [polls] are not like the jokes you heard as a Kid they're not done. They're not alcoholic stuff like that. You don't have that. I mean. Yes there are but that's everywhere It's not more or less than you get another country so that also kind of [shocked] the people they come here cuz I'm you saw Those Polish jokes where what is it for Polish people, and how do they don't move the bed or something? You don't have that here the second thing that will shock you when you come here also deals with the polish people are how catholic and how religious the people are I mean I remember going on the buses and Lovely and he's like punk rock guys are on the in there and and they go by a church and they all do the sign Of the cross I'm like whoa. [I] didn't expect that people here in poland are very religious and the churches this is st. Mary honestly the first time I walked in there 20 years ago I would just draw drop [wow] the booths are all blue altar the blue steel and everything It's just amazing and the churches around the country are gorgeous, and they're actually building more churches here. You know other countries They're turning churches into apartments and hotels in bars here people still go to church They still do believe and you do have a very religious conservative feel when the people are here Which is kind of a different thing [and] you go and when you go in the churches? That's the real thing [about] it You really see the beauty of the churches the ones that have them been destroyed during the war that Maybe they've been rebuilt but like here and other ones you really go and just see the majestic beauty of the churches here So do take the chance to go into the churches don't just go oh, it's another church Go in and check it out that kind of leads into the third thing [that'll] shock you when you come to poland It's how much poland was destroyed during the second world war I mean, Krakow was lucky didn't really get destroyed during the war But a lot [of] the other cities were just leveled for example Warsaw when you go there You'll go see the uprising [museum] and realize that everything old and Cracow is actually younger than top of your dad Because they had to rebuild it all after the war because [it] got leveled by the nazis and you'll see that and you go around That's why you'll see the [communist] architecture and the big square long rectangle buildings and stuff like that Because there was nothing there It was all destroyed so they had to rebuild and when you really see the level of destruction Throughout the country and how much they've come back and built new stuff You'll be very proud [of] the people and that's what's really cool about it now the fourth thing [is] Gonna Shock you [anna] come to Poland is how completely incomprehensible and illegible the polish language is look if you don't speak Polish [it's] okay the locals know you don't speak polish [also] try to think polish with you, but oh Just to one of those languages you're listing at the train station. You're like. Yeah, I got nothing yeah, I don't know it's City I'm going to it is [a] very tough language It's very hard to pronounce like how do you say? Prz in a row and there's like a hat and there's an L with a line through it Is that a zero well? What is that you do get pretty confused when you are here? And it is kind of shocking that you can't even make out some of the stuff now We are developing better for tourism so you will have a lot of you know English menus and stuff like that But it is a really good idea to know some polish before you come like [Julia]. Which is like Thank you for the steam is please things like that because it really get those people to go from You say not pure protein oh Yes, they polish, and they really open up then okay The first thing [that] might shock you is your eating experience here the [poles] really love their potatoes And their cabbage and even if it's not on the menu like it might tell it to cutlet [night] It'll come with Cabbage and potatoes here I go [ah] I'll have [the] port of the pork knuckle and said oh it comes of pork and calves what?

That's why yesterday I just got the cabbage rolls I'm like look because that I know I'm getting the cabbage Haha, but it came with a side of mashed potatoes And I just liked it laughs okay also kind of interesting is they really love their tea here, too Now the sixth thing that might shock you as a tourist is You notice there's not very many tourists now in Cracow you do get about ten million tourists a year I mean, this is a very popular place because it's gorgeous, and I'll talk about that towards the end But honestly there's not a lot of tourists actually come to poland and so when you go around you really are kind of a special Tourist because you are actually here you might get people going Why are you luling and wiring? Whoosh? Why are you here? You know [some] places like cracow it's obvious You know we go around and there's just so few tourists out there that you're like Hey\\nI can kick back relax And do [ok] and what kind of [leave] thought of that is our next shock is how Cheap it is here because there's not a lot [of] [tours] driving up the prices It's nice because you can have a very affordable vacation here in poland rooms Accommodation food drink making merry all kinds of stuff And you'll see a lot of people come to like krakauer Warsaw to go have a party weekend and stuff like that because you really can your money goes a lot farther here than other places And that's what's really cool now the next thing.

       " 'Narrator: Poland has been dubbed\\nthe worst place to live in the European Union if you are LGBTQ+. In recent years, around 100 local authorities\\nacross the country have signed declarations against\\nwhat they call LGBT ideology. In the face of attacks\\nand hostile hate speech, activists continue to fight back. They march in pride events\\naround the country and have even managed to pressure some\\ncouncils to backtrack on their declarations. Still, much of Poland\\nremains a virtual no-go area. LGBTQ people in Poland told us\\nthey now feel more alienated and afraid than ever. The situation is getting\\nonly worse and worse. We are basically treated not like human beings. Narrator: In the spring of 2019, the quiet town of Kraśnik\\nin southeast Poland signed a declaration saying that\\nbeing lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer undermines traditional values and Polish family life. Jan Albiniak is an elected\\nofficial in Kraśnik who voted in favor of the\\ndeclaration against so-called LGBTQ ideology. Narrator: He believes that pride\\nmarches, and even mentioning LGBTQ issues in schools, damages traditional Polish family values. The declarations are not laws, but they send out a clear\\nmessage to the local LGBTQ community.\\nIn Kraśnik, Adam Cezary Gąska flies the only rainbow flag we could find. For him, it\\'s a protest against the\\ntown\\'s homophobic stance.\\n \\nBut when he put it up in\\n2020, it soon attracted some unwanted attention. Adam is keeping his flag, as\\nwell as his faith in the future. It has never been easy for\\nLGBTQ people in Poland, which is staunchly\\nconservative and Catholic. But support for LGBTQ rights, and the number of pride marches,\\nhas grown steadily over the last 20 years. When the right-wing and\\neuro-skeptic Law and Justice party came to power\\nin 2015, the tone changed. First, they framed migrants\\nas the national threat. But by the 2019 election cycle, they\\'d switched attention to\\ndemonizing the LGBTQ community as a way of rallying voters\\nagainst a perceived threat. Narrator: This is when towns like Kraśnik began signing declarations or\\nadopting so-called \"family charters.\" And in the 2020 presidential runoff, President Andrzej Duda beat the\\npro-Europe and pro-LGBT-rights mayor of Warsaw with his hard-line stance. One of his main campaign\\nmessages: Being gay is, quote, \"an ideology worse than communism.\" Other religious and political\\nleaders have likened it to Nazism or a disease. Miłosz: We are called the rainbow plague. We are basically treated\\nnot like human beings, which has even been said, that LGBT is not people -- it\\'s an ideology. Narrator: Also in 2020, 200,000\\npeople signed a petition calling for a ban on all pride marches and\\ndelivered it to parliament. And in June 2021, the education minister called\\nan equality parade through Warsaw and insult to public morality, the latest official outcry\\nin one of the most religious countries on the continent. Many fear that the language\\nemployed by local councils and central government could be a\\nprecursor for a clampdown on rights -- and even physical violence. While much of Europe is seeing the rise of\\nprogressive, inclusive policies around same-sex\\nmarriage and adoption, in Poland both are outlawed. And with the help of the\\nright-wing, state-owned media, the notion that being gay\\nor trans is an ideology is gaining traction. In Polish we say that if you\\nthrow enough mud on somebody, some of it will stick. You would expect that\\nreasonable people would say, \"Well, that\\'s bulls---.\" But if you hear this bulls---\\nall the time, you know, the repeated message all the\\ntime saying the same things or the same awful things, some of this will stay in people\\'s heads. Narrator: About 25 kilometers\\nsouth of Kraśnik is the district of Niedrzwica Duza. The town council here signed\\na declaration a couple of days before Kraśnik did, in May 2019. Kazimierz\\nStrzelec was stunned. Narrator: Kazimierz has been a\\ndevout Catholic all his life. He\\'s also a gay-rights activist\\nand organizes pride events every year. He says since the polarizing political\\nhate campaigns of the last few years, things have got worse, and\\nnow even feels rejected by members of his own church. In 2019, he helped organize the second-ever\\npride march in the nearby city of Lublin. At the march, police arrested a couple\\ncarrying a homemade bomb. Narrator: Equality marches, as they\\'re known in Poland,\\nwere banned as recently as 2007. They have become more widespread,\\nwith an estimated 25 held across the country in 2019. But they still face\\nconsiderable opposition. Kazimierz has particularly\\nstrong memories of the first ever march in the northeastern\\ncity of Bialystok, which descended into violence in July 2019. Narrator: But the fight back is underway. After towns began signing their declarations in 2019, a group of activists started\\na campaign of naming and shaming. An online map called the\\nAtlas of Hate pinpoints every place that has signed\\ndeclarations or so-called family charters, which both claim to want\\nto halt the spread of LGBT ideology. The map inspired Polish\\ngay-rights activist Bart Staszewski to then put\\nup signs at the entrance to each town declaring them \"LGBT-free.\" Bart: So I created a sign, the \"LGBT-free zone\" sign that I bring with me to the cities that declare as LGBT-free. I put it there. I invite people who are brave enough to join my project from those cities, the LGBT people, to make a\\ntestimonial of how they feel being excluded from the local community. Narrator: And he worries about the future. Bart: The young people are\\nafraid of coming out because the atmosphere is simply homophobic. Those poor kids that\\nare committing suicide because of the homophobia\\nin Poland, because they are just afraid\\nof coming out, because there are families, parents throw them out from the\\nhomes because they heard on TV that they are kind of demons, and\\nthey are perverts, or whatever. Narrator: Both the map and Bart\\'s guerrilla tactics\\ngot international media attention, and the declarations\\ndrew a scathing response from the EU. So I want to be crystal clear: LGBTQI-free zones are humanity-free zones, and they have no place in our union. Narrator: Those behind the map\\nwere nominated for a prestigious human-rights award from\\nthe European Union. Towns highlighted began to pay the price\\nfor their homophobia, losing access to European funds. Kraśnik lost millions in grant\\nmoney from Norway, and was dropped by its twin city in\\nFrance. Then, in April 2021, Kraśnik backed down and\\nrepealed its declaration. In the months that followed,\\nother towns followed suit. But large swathes of\\nthe map are still red. And a group of local governments\\nare suing the activists behind the Atlas of Hate for slander. In many countries, younger generations tend\\nto be more progressive. But in Poland, these deeply entrenched beliefs\\nare held by old and young alike. The All-Polish Youth is a far-right\\nnationalist movement here ... Narrator: Miłosz Przepiórkowski\\nruns a charity offering counseling and support for Poland\\'s LGBTQ community. Miłosz: We can only see how\\ndevastated they are by the fact that they are not accepted for who they are. So this is very tragic,\\nespecially for young people. Narrator: He surveyed 10,000 young\\nLGBTQ people across the country in 2016 together with a\\nconsortium of organizations. They found that 70% had suicidal\\nthoughts or were depressed compared to less than half\\nof American LGBTQ+ youth. And almost 70% of LGBTQ people\\nof all ages in Poland had been the focus of homophobic abuse. Miłosz: I think it\\'s very important\\nto show them that they have a place where they can get real\\nsupport. That there are people who are like them. There are people who can help them. It is a human right to feel protected in their own state,\\nto have this dignity and having the right to marry whenever, who they like. It\\'s not hurting anybody, and they\\nneed to state that this is true. We are not hurting anybody. We just demand equality,\\nnot the privilege. Narrator: When Kasik considers\\nhis struggle for equality in Poland, he takes an optimistic view,\\nand an inspirational quote:',\n",
       " \"[Music] there's nothing here to remind me of my birthplace there was once a beautiful square morinovsky square i remember trees and benches i was born in warsaw into a traditional jewish family i went to a preschool for jewish children where they taught polish at home we spoke yiddish but i had no problem with the polish language we he had this trick where he'd pretend to stitch his fingers together with a needle of course he made a huge impression on us kids would be horrified he had a daughter called lonya who was friends with my sister sometimes i can see it more clearly than the warsaw around me today in my memory it's still the same in the morning warm pretzels would be delivered they were called bagels you won't find bagels like those anywhere these days you could take one and untwist it my parents lived at 49 it was a so-called i remember we had to recite prayers some children would say they didn't know the prayers i was sitting in a sand pit and my mum came over she said there's a war what are we going to do [Music] it's the special quality of the nazi system people who had the energy to develop something had the power to do it when mr dengel took over in warsaw in early december 39 he had the idea to invite hubert cross to come to warsaw and build a german baufa vailton growth upon the advice of mr dengle developed a dream of reducing warsaw to next to nothing on the screen is the visualization from one of my projects it's based on fascist plans for the construction of a new german city the neues this is a virtual reconstruction of that new warsaw this is the city center it's a relatively small city the entrances were to be guarded by watchtowers on all sides these are the main buildings of the new german warsaw deutsche state varsity there was to be a district for poles who would be slowly exterminated the new german city of warsaw was to be inhabited only by germans there was to be no jewish population with regard to warsaw the fuhrer has decided that the reconstruction of that city as a major polish metropolis is absolutely out of the question the fuhrer's wish is that in accordance with plans for the territory's development under the general government warsaw be reduced to the level of a provincial city from the diary of governor general hunts frank once the germans arrived the terror began almost right away with various official announcements and notices all jews were forced to wear armbands with the star of david it was offered in my mind this was a form of degradation at any moment i could be humiliated in the spring of 1940 consultations began with a view to creating one or more jewish housing districts within the city of warsaw in the end however it was decided that a single district should be established in the area where jews were traditionally the majority dr friedrich s s untersturmfuhrer head of division of regional planning office of the governor of the district of warsaw [Music] where was the jewish neighborhood in warsaw there were jewish neighborhoods yeah lefke novolipki where it was almost all jewish but when you when you're a third of the city you're all over the city and the interaction with non-jews was a normal daily event that comes to a crashing halt with the building of the warsaw ghetto wall which goes through the heart of the city and divides jews from non-jews as they were never divided before [Music] the wall didn't appear suddenly bits and pieces of wall started to be built from april 1940. these were sections of wall or barriers with barbed wire they popped up in various places [Music] i had no idea i was jewish so first i was asking why do we have to move and later what does it mean that i'm jewish and why do we have to leave our homes [Music] yes when we arrived in the ghetto the first thing i saw was a horrible poster i didn't want to be like that jew on the poster and i was distraught at being forced to live there i thought that every jew had to look like that i was so terribly humiliated by all this i said to my mum i didn't want to be a jew anymore that i wanted to go back to martial street and why was all this happening anyway notice by order of the district governor and effective immediately a self-contained jewish quarter is to be created in the district of warsaw with a view to preventing the spread of disease in the city of warsaw a boundary running around the jewish quarter has been established all border streets are to be closed off from it on both sides as follows from gielna to krulevska and zwata from zwata to jielna and jalasna from tuvada to jalasna and srebrena from srebrena to tavada and miyajana from miyajana to srebrena and kajimiresh square so so so so we already lived in the area that was now the ghetto because moronowski square was inside the area jews who lived outside the ghetto had to move in and polls who lived in the ghetto had to move out this led to very painful situations for people they left their homes they left their furniture and possessions carrying only a few small bundles with them the ghetto became very crowded [Music] we've all seen the images of the expulsion of the jewish community something similar happened the other way around too there were tens of thousands of people like us i remember sitting on a cart full of our [Music] things [Music] [Music] apartment 110. measures involve the resettlement of around 700 ethnic germans 113 000 poles and 138 000 jews the warsaw jewish housing district is an enclosed area cut off from its surroundings by walls fences and so on movement of persons and goods in and out of the area is by special permit only dr friedrich golett s s untersturmfuhrer head of division of regional planning office of the governor of the district of warsaw [Music] the jewish population always looked for contacts but my mother put aside potatoes and feelings for her later lania stopped coming she and my father just ceased to exist i don't remember any farewell or any of the circumstances maybe my memories suppressed it because it was too terrible the city center was cut off and ceased to function normally when you see which part of the city made up the ghetto you realize it was really the heart of warsaw if you take into account that the germans also carved off a piece for themselves what was left of warsaw for other residents was just a small part the german housing district has been created for the protection of the german population at their request the police cannot guarantee germans living outside of this district the same degree of personal safety as is provided to those living within it hans fliegner nazi party star slighter warsaw [Music] night and day by rail in carts and buses jews arrive here from polish towns and villages the individual vanishes in this enormous human mass people are crammed in individual faces are unrecognizable [Music] the german army and civilians must in any event be protected from the jews immune carriers of disease the separation of jews from the rest of the population polish as well as ethnic germans is a moral and political imperative traffic in the centre of warsaw has also been only minimally affected by the creation of the jewish housing district in the interests of the wehrmacht and the economy great care was taken to ensure that certain main thoroughfares would remain crossable without obstruction to through traffic valdemarchon s s standard fura director of department of resettlement office of the governor of the district of warsaw [Music] the german planners divided things up each administering their division they even designated which streets a tram would travel along to shorten its route through the ghetto that created two ghettos it was all a terrifying mishmash of evil wadna street ended up dividing the jewish district the district was cut into two parts by the critically important tram line that ran along the ghetto was divided into two parts a small ghetto and a large one in order for jews to move back and forth between the small and the large ghetto it was necessary to stop the flow of traffic at intervals since this was inconvenient for the germans jews were given permission to cross over as infrequently as possible as i walked along jalajna i would see from a distance the crowd milling at the corner of kodner people would be shifting restlessly on the spot waiting for the german police to decide when the traffic on kwatner was light enough and the crowd on zalajna thick enough to warrant letting the jews across the street when the moment finally came the police cordon would part and the impatient crowd would surge forward in both directions pushing each other over in the panic to distance themselves from the dangerous german presence and melt once more into the depths of the two ghettos a line in the pavement shows where the ghetto border ran how the ghetto fit into warsaw it wasn't an isolated island surrounded by the unknown it was embedded in the city in each plaque there's a marker showing where we are the parts of downtown warsaw that were torn away are elevated and my intention was to show the ghetto in real space how it was and where the boundary ranked who didn't have a lot of money or didn't have a pole who was his friend didn't stand a chance there was nothing he could do he cared only about what he would eat the next day and what he would give his children about 80 of food in the ghetto came from smuggling not from the official suppliers authorized by the germans if someone had money they could get things into the ghetto somehow i once witnessed a tram passing through muranowski square and as it turned the corner items were thrown out it couldn't stop in the ghetto this was how trade carried on in some places the ghetto walls did not come right down to the pavement at regular intervals there were openings at ground level through which water flowed into drains running along the sidewalks these openings were also used by children for smuggling tiny dark creatures with legs like matchsticks would converge on these openings from all sides terrified eyes darted from left to right and frail paws dragged through bundles that were often bigger than the tiny smugglers themselves so so [Music] [Music] notice any jew unlawfully leaving the designated housing district is to be punished by death the same punishment will apply to persons who consciously protect such jews or in any way assist them warsaw 10th of november 1941 dr fisher governor is a very important street for me this is a street i was scared of and i still am to this day i've never walked this street without feeling afraid behind this wall i spent more than two years in the ghetto with my family when i first found myself back here i began looking obsessively for the hole through which my mum and i had escaped i just stood there going back in time trying to figure where that hole could be but the hole was probably somewhere else further on i see two years of humiliation imprisonment hunger i still expect to either see or remember something terrible there [Music] [Music] so [Music] so all around i could see handcarts and on them bodies of men women and children piled carelessly one on top of the other i became aware of a strange vaguely sweet and sickening odor but never smelled before [Music] a jewish policeman explained next to the jewish cemetery there was once a large field today it's one of the biggest mass graves ever filled with the bodies of jews from all corners of europe could this be real how is it possible that a human being of flesh and blood should have to die in such a pitiful fashion the german occupation murdered 90 of the jews here it's heartbreaking and then if you could imagine that not only does the wall go through the heart of the city right in the middle of a street it stops but on the other side of that wall starvation disease and very soon after deportation to death for security reasons i order that the ghetto of warsaw be demolished all utilizable building parts and other materials of any value are to first be salvaged an overall plan for the raising of the ghetto is to be submitted to me we must in any event ensure that the living space occupied until now by five hundred thousand sub-humans and in no way fit for habitation by germans disappears completely and that warsaw this city of one million always a center of corruption and revolt is reduced in size heinrich himmler reichsfuhrer ss at the same time as an organized resistance group was preparing to fight jews in the ghetto were going into i went into that bunker in january 43 and in april the uprising broke out my brothers left to take part in the uprising this bunker was built around a basement that had been dug deeper with boarded up sides the dugout earth was piled up all around and it provided some kind of insulation when the fires started everything in the neighboring basements collapsed and burned but this bunker survived [Music] i remember 1943 seeing uncanny clouds of smoke rising from the north fighting in the ghetto something was happening there [Music] there is no longer a jewish quarter of warsaw jurgen stroup s s gruppenfuhrer it still pains me that after all these years i never got to mourn my family i never even had time for that i lost everyone i had six brothers and a sister and parents i'm the only one who survived it all i was left as a witness without me there'd be nobody the value of life is in bearing witness street concentration camp was set up to hold people needed to demolish the ghetto it wasn't only blown up with dynamite but also dismantled it was completely plundered and that camp was hell people died there on the ruins of the ghetto the nazis wanted to create a park for germans hence the demolition the area was to be covered over with earth and turned into a garden paradise the intention was to destroy the capital of what was formerly poland that was the main intention to destroy the idea alone of a capital because there was no more poland i spent almost a year on the aryan side there was a whole network of helpers if things got dangerous someone would come by and take you by the hand [Music] on the 1st of august 1944 the uprising broke out twice i lived through the burning of warsaw all around the walls were almost red-hot and people were being herded along on both sides of the streets burning debris was coming down warsaw was on fire and you could feel it [Music] after liberation in 1945 you couldn't live in warsaw really and slowly trying to rebuild and then getting again undermined by soviet occupation and oppression it's difficult to imagine what was here before the war this area has changed so much certain streets and squares ceased to exist names were changed directions were altered no more than a dozen or so original buildings have survived this area has many layers underneath the ground is a second layer which shows itself when workers dig down to lay pipes then the remains of the past are uncovered in 1949 the architect created a housing estate which was to be a memorial space what was unique was that the bricks of the buildings were made from rubble on top of whatever else that was in the rubble including human remains that stands out because warsaw is a flat city [Music] people calling me and saying there are spirits in my apartment i'm in the old ghetto can you do something well i have this that's beyond my competence but i did go and i said psalms because if a person feels i could make them if i make someone feel more at peace then i'm happy to do so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] on this map i've marked the location of your former home superimposing it on the current image it was on this street at the intersection that's where your home used to be i was born here [Music] [Music] the memory of the ghetto it's beginning to really return into the memory into the soul of warsaw give people a chance to remember and chances are they will remember april 19th the anniversary of the warsaw uprising while we're moving farther away from the event actually the number of people coming is growing that's a sign of hope [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you\",\n",
       " 'Holidays are a time when each of us is looking for a pleasant, light reading and I would like to recommend such reading to you today, or actually two such readings. Of course, we remain on the Polish topic and both readings will be about Poland. I am Ania, I am a teacher of Polish as a foreign language, and apart from Polish, I love all the languages \\u200b\\u200bof the world. And this is Płynnie po polsku, channel for learners of the Polish language. And not only. First of all, it is a book by Bernard Newman entitled \"Pedalling Poland\", that is, the Second Polish Republic. Bernard Newman was obviously not a Polish writer, but an English one. Bernard Newman was an Englishman. And besides being a writer, he was also a traveler, so he was describing his travels. In his books, he described very often how he traveled in certain countries. He also just described his journey through the former Poland, which then in the years 1918-1945 - let me remind you - was called the Second Polish Republic. Today, we could say that such a country does not exist anymore, because the Second Polish Republic also included areas that are not part of Poland today, such as Vilnius and Lviv. And Bernard Newman rode a bicycle in these areas. It is an absolutely fascinating story, written with fantastic English ironic humor. Bernard Newman also described not only his next stages of the journey, because he traveled all over the country, he reported his trips to Gdańsk, Kraków, Silesia, Warsaw, he also described his struggles with learning the Polish language, which for me was probably the most interesting part. He was amazed that we had so many declensions. He also described his mistakes, but also his little successes. That is why I think this book is a fantastic choice for a vacation, because it is very light, very pleasant, and at the same time we can learn a lot about Poland and Polish. I think it is especially interesting if you can read it in the original, because it is written in the original in English, of course. I read it in Polish and I recommend it as well, because the translation was really, very good. Apart from describing specific regions or cities, Bernard Newman focused more on meeting people, on such episodes from the everyday life of the town he was in, the village or the city. And I think that this also made this book a picture of how Poles lived then, what they ate for breakfast, where they worked, how they behaved, which was strange for them and what was strange for an Englishman then in Poland and in Poles. The second reading I would like to recommend to you is Zbigniew Rokita\\'s report entitled \"Kajś. A \\u200b\\u200bTale of Upper Silesia\". The book may be a bit more difficult than the previous one. This time the book was written in the original Polish by a Polish author. And about Poland again. More specifically, about Upper Silesia, which is one of the regions of Poland. I think this book is interesting not only for foreigners, but also for Poles, because I learned a lot from it. I must admit that I reached for it without conviction, that is, I had to force myself to finally start reading it. But I was not disappointed, it was really amazing. And I did not expect it to be so light, so pleasant to read. Rather, reportages remind me of pages filled with a lot of information, so much that after a few pages I cannot read any further and have to put them aside. Of course, I like reportage very much, but it is often informative reading. This report was written like a story, a bit like a novel actually. And I think that\\'s why it surprised me so pleasantly, because I felt like I was really immersed in this reading, deep in history. And really a family history, because it is a family history, it was very immersive. It\\'s such a new word maybe. We often say that books are immersive. Immersive, they immerse us, which means they are very, very interesting. We cannot tear ourselves away from them. So much for my today\\'s recommendations. Very short and very fast. But I hope that you will choose one of these two for your vacation to learn something about Poland. And maybe read some of these books in Polish. Let me know in the comments what your reading is for the holidays, I hope it is something in Polish, or at least that it is about Poland. And we will see you in the next episode. See you, bye bye!',\n",
       " 'Did you know that Poland has the third lowest unemployment rate in  the European Union? There is still not enough people to work. Not only in new technologies or IT sectors, although first of all, but also in the service industry and construction.  Does it pay to work in Poland? You\\'re about to find out! Cześć! I\\'m Weronka from Wellcome Home and I\\'m your guide for your relocation to Poland. Today I\\'m going to tell you about our labor market in Poland. If you\\'re looking for a job you have to know our labor system, different types of agreements and the most common benefits. Many of them can really surprise you!  Types of agreements, which one will be the best for you? When browsing job offers it\\'s important to understand what type of agreement is offered to you. Listen carefully, because here I\\'ll also mention what to do to work in Poland legally.  What types of agreements do we have in Poland and which one will be the best for you? Employment contact, in Polish it is umowa o pracę. it’s the primary form of agreement in Poland. Later on, when referring to salaries and most common benefits, I’ll refer to this contract. A full-time job has an 8 hour work day, for 40 hours per week. It can be signed for a definite or indefinite time period. Usually at the beginning there\\'s a 3-month trial period. There is a notice period and minimum monthly wage. I\\'ll talk later about this. Pros? You have a stable employment and regular pay. In Poland you get paid no later than on the 10th. Also, you have a health insurance, paid sick leave, paid vacation,  maternity leave, the longest in Europe! Cons? Lack of flexibility and again the notice period, especially if you\\'re the one who wants to leave early.  Contract of mandate in Polish is umowa zlecenie. It\\'s popular especially for students and first time job seekers.  There’s no minimum number of hours per month. And there’s a minimum wage. Pros? It’s flexible and you’re insured you have paid sick leave and maternity leave. Cons? No paid vacations and a rather low salary. Also, it can also be terminated at any time. Specific-task contract - umowa o dzieło.  Is a specific contract on which both parties agree on the result of the work and not a process itself. It’s flexible, with no defined work hours. Cons? No insurance nor other benefits and no minimum wage.  It’s good if it\\'s a sideline for your main job. And what about self employment? In Poland, you can run a one person company and provide your services to companies based on a B2B contract. Some companies may accept, or even prefer such a contract to work with you. You pay personal income tax (PIT) and social and health premiums. The basic income tax is 17%. Pros: You’re independent, flexible and you can provide your services to many companies. You’re also more cost-effective for the employer than when hiring an employee directly. Cons? You have to pay your taxes yourself and you deal with all the red tape.  Also, this solution is beneficial only above a certain salary amount. Would you like to know more about self-employment in Poland? Let me know in the comments.  Important info for foreigners Whether you can legally work in Poland depends on your citizenship and/or the visa on which you came here. We talk about this in detail in the video: 7 things to know before coming to Poland. One more thing!  Make sure to apply for a PESEL number. It\\'s needed to settle your annual taxes. We talk about this in details in the previously mentioned video. Make sure to check it out. Ok, time for something you’re here for - money!  Beware the advertised salary isn’t the same as your take home pay. Let me explain this. Advertised salaries in job offers are usually given in gross amounts they haven’t deducted income tax and insurance you have to pay The final amount (the one that will take home) is the net amount  after taxes and insurance have been paid. But! The total cost to the employer is your gross salary plus some additional premiums he has to pay for you. 2022 is a crazy year we’ve faced a huge tax reform - a New Polish Deal. and to understand all the calculations is kinda tough. but let me give you an example. to get 5000 zł net (your take home) your gross salary should be around 7000 zł, although the total cost for the employer is 8500 zł because of the additional premiums he had to pay. The Polish minimum monthly wage is currently 3010 gross, around 2200 zł net. The hourly rate, if you work, for example, on a contract of mandate is around 20, just under 14 zł net. Not much, but the average monthly wage in Poland at the beginning of 2022 was about 6100 PLN gross, just under 4400 PLN net, quite a jump. You can expect the minimum wage or close to it when working in the service industry - as a server or sales person especially if you’re just starting out in the labor market.   Unfortunately, government employees in Poland also earn closer to the minimum wage rather than the average salary.  Higher salaries are possible in private companies in growing industries, hold on a second, I\\'ll get to them soon. Now your question surely is: how do I know my final net salary?  There are special online payroll calculators. Check the link to some in description. Your first 30 000 zł is tax-free. Above that the tax is 17% - up to 120,000 zł per year, the first tax bracket, and above this amount the tax is 32%. Important: Employees under 26 don’t pay income tax. So this is somehow intended to compensate for a lower salary when starting out. And where to search for a good job in Poland? Before we get into this, you have to know the following issues. Did you know that in Poland, after having a baby, a woman can return to work after up to 4 years of leave?  What are  some other employee benefits in Poland? Remember, we are still talking about a full-time basic employment contract. 26 days of paid vacation per year These are weekdays, without weekends. On top of that there are 13 public holidays per year! What’s more, if a holiday falls on a Saturday, a day off can be used another time. Paid sick leave is 80% of your pay. Pregnant women get full pay on sick leave. Remember: it must be issued by a doctor. Maternity leave in Poland lasts 52 weeks - the longest in Europe!  20 weeks apply to the mother, she receives 100% of pay. Then the mother or father can  take \"parental\" leave for another 32 weeks, receiving 60% of their salary. This for a total of one year. You can add to this your paid vacation days that accumulated during that period. but it’s not over… After that you can have… extended post-maternity leave for another 3 years! You don’t get paid, but you’re still an official employee with health insurance and your old-age pension insurance paid. The notice period depends on seniority Up to 6 months seniority it’s 2 weeks up to 3 years - a month and above that your notice period is 3 months. This is a safeguard for you, but also for the employer - so that the employee doesn’t suddenly leave. You can leave earlier if your employer agrees but he doesn’t have to. And additionally, a pregnant woman cannot be fired in Poland. A work day is usually 8 hours including ONLY a 15-minute lunch break. Yeah, that’s official law  but more and more companies agree to flexible work hours, so you decide when you start, when you have a break. And hybrid working models with some days from home. Don’t be afraid to negotiate! If you’re still here, it means you’re really thinking of working in Poland.  Time for some previously-mentioned data. Top 3 best paid professions in Poland are brand manager, key account manager, and IT Security Specialist. They can expect around 10 000 zł gross a month. Software developers rank 7th, but this is an average salary.  An experienced Senior Developer can expect 15 000 zł. The fastest growing sectors with an ongoing need for skilled employees are IT, telecommunications, marketing, and e-commerce. Although starting salaries may be lower, many jobs are also waiting in construction, the services and hospitality industries, the medical profession, and logistics.  Well, the best way is to search online. he biggest website for job offers in Poland is pracuj.pl. It’s available in Polish and Ukrainian only, but many offers are published in English. It’s Poland’s number 1 website for jobs. If you\\'re in the so-called “creative industry” we recommend rocketjobs.pl. Offers here often include the salary scale, which isn’t always given in Poland. So you already know what you’re fighting for and you can avoid the most embarrassing question you can get during an interview which is how much would you like to earn? Are you curious how Polish salaries compare to the cost of living? Is it possible to get by? Take a look at our previous video about living costs in Poland. I really want to know what surprised you the most! Good luck! \\nSee you in Poland.',\n",

       " \"there are more and more indications that the winter of 223 224 will be one of the worst moments for Ukraine since the beginning of the epidemic. Russia, despite some successes and the operation aimed at breaking through the left bank of the Dnieper, the Ukrainian offensive is at an impasse and Russia seems to be preparing for a massive attack which may actually happen At any moment, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky warned against the possibility of an increase in Russian attacks on Ukraine's infrastructure this winter. In one of his last speeches, he emphasized that Ukraine must prepare for an increased number of drone or missile attacks on the country's infrastructure. Zelensky also thanked several countries, including Poland, for the support provided to Ukraine in strengthening its air defense. However, there are many indications that if this country finds itself against the proverbial wall, Poland will have to provide assistance, as usual, because we and Romania are the only ones who can save Ukraine from energy collapse. Poland and Romania are said to have already prepared high-voltage transformers which the Ukrainians will take when they need them, as written in The economist. According to the undp report, in April 2023, the electricity generation capacity in Ukraine decreased by 51 % compared to the period just before the Russian invasion in February 2022, although Ukraine boasts of improving its anti-missile shield with the help of, among others, Poland, the USA or other allied countries, the strike force that Russia is currently gathering in Crimea may shake the stability of the Ukrainian state, so Poland can expect further Ukrainian requests for help, and it is now receiving them as a partner Today's material is the Ley shops cashback platform, to use their services you need to go to the link in the description and then download the application or log in to the platform, for example using Facebook or Google, the whole process is very simple and will take only a few seconds Leti shops also has the option yes called hot cashback, for example, it is now available on Allegro hot cashback from your purchases will be five times larger than standard, so it's worth hurrying because it's a really good opportunity, you can save much more money, and no matter how you look at it, the holidays are coming now, so money for gifts They will definitely come in handy. Leti shops also thought about this by creating a lottery for you in which you can win as much as PLN 100,000. You have time to enter this lottery from November 20, 2023 to December 22, 2023 at 6:00 p.m. All you need to do is register in Leti Shop, accept the lottery regulations and make purchases in selected partner stores using their platform, for each purchase you receive lottery tickets, link to Leti Shop from their lottery and hot cashback on Allegro are in the description I think it's worth using, there will always be something left in your pocket Well, now it's time for today's material, I invite you energy from Polish power plants has been saving Ukraine from Blackout for a long time Our neighbor in mid-August was struggling with heat and record demand for electricity, so he bought energy from us on an unprecedented scale, as the Ukrainian network operator explained, this is the best option But the alternative is to turn off electricity to consumers before the Russian invasion. Ukraine was able to produce much more energy than it consumed. This allowed it to survive when part of the energy system was destroyed by the invaders. It also had transformers that had just been decommissioned and could be reconnected to the grid when the Russians destroyed them. the newer ones, nevertheless, between October 10 and the end of December last year, the average Ukrainian household did not have electricity for a total period of five weeks, hence Ukraine has now informed Poland that in the event of further infrastructure destruction it will need it. Once again, energy support from Poland, of course, Kiev has pay for this energy because, as you know, if there were deliveries for the glory of the homeland, many Poles would probably not be satisfied with this fact, especially since the relations between Poland and Ukraine have recently become significantly cooler, but the authorities of our eastern neighbors are as usual There have been requests for much more than that a dozen or so days ago, on November 2 , 2023, the President of Ukraine, Vlad Zelensky, appeared at the forum of the Supreme Council of Poland with an appeal for help in the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war, in his speech he said that Ukraine needs to rebuild everything that Russia has destroyed, we need Poland to rebuild our country to be able to live in peace and security, which is important Załęski He also emphasized that Poland is one of Ukraine's most important allies in the fight against Russia He thanked Poland for the help provided to Ukraine since the beginning of the war, including accepting over 2 and 5 million refugees from Ukraine at the same time Counting on our country's support in rebuilding the war damage, may we participate in this reconstruction, and hopefully this time not for nothing, it is disturbing that some in Europe are playing Solidarity in the political theater, turning the seed into a thriller. The words of the President of Ukraine spoken at the UN about the play of some countries in the Moscow theater and the cooling of mutual relations in August were completely unnecessary and many Poles he certainly holds it against him. Especially since in terms of military support for the defending Ukrainians, Poland is at the forefront and has often given more than it really could. The undisputed leader here is, of course, the United States, whose support has so far cost almost as much as In my opinion, this is what it is heading towards, and it is increasingly coming to the attention of both warring parties to Putin, and they both know that the Chinese and the Americans want to stop the escalation of military actions, to stop military operations, to reach a ceasefire, and most importantly, the vast majority of this equipment has already reached Ukraine, it includes Patriot systems, Abrams tanks and Haars long-range artillery systems. The Polish government does not conduct regular cyclical information activities. So there is no complete information about the deliveries, but what we have provided is worth over USD 4 billion, causing To this day, we are among the six countries that have provided the Ukrainians with the most military equipment, but this amount is greatly underestimated because they often gave us equipment whose value on the market differed significantly due to its age, so the amount of even $6 to $8 billion may not be at all be greatly exaggerated because not everything was included in the official data, let's first take into account tanks, among those delivered to Kiev the T72 dominates, well known to the Russians because of the Soviet design, Poland delivered the largest number of this type of vehicles and, according to unofficial data, at least 250 versions of this type were delivered to Ukraine t72m t72 M1 and t72 m1r When it comes to tanks, Poland has no equal, no one, not even the Americans, delivered as many of them as we did, the Polish authorities also sent 10 MiG 29s and declared the transfer of, among others, the S60 anti-aircraft guns along with 70,000 missiles intended for them, among others. equipment transferred from Poland to Ukraine also included various types of small arms, including grenade launchers, mortars and, among others, carbines, lightning bolts, Stinger launchers and many others. Also, the Polish defense industry plays a huge role in rearmament. Only last year, the Ukrainian side signed a contract with Huta Stalowa Wola , the manufacturer of guns, hit scrab, contract for the construction of 56 crabs, as noted by The economist, despite the delivery of such a huge amount of equipment during the 5 months of the counteroffensive, Ukraine managed to move the front line by only 17 km, and as the dependent general stated, currently the fighting is at a stalemate and without major supplies from the West in Therefore, Poland's continued counteroffensive and even defense may be much more difficult or simply impossible at the same time. Further tranches of support from Poland to Ukraine and the entire West are in doubt. Anyway, you remember perfectly well what Prime Minister Morawiecki said that Poland is now rearming . But back to the topic, the former chief Czesław Mroczek, vice-chairman of the parliamentary defense committee, who will most likely take power with his position, emphasized that decisions on how to further specifically help Ukraine in military matters require knowing the state of its own resources. Poland should act as part of the Ramstein group to support Ukraine in supplying it with military equipment and armament, we should make efforts to increase European Union spending under the European Peace Instrument are very serious measures thanks to which, among other things, we received a refund for the armament provided to Ukraine, Mroczek said in an interview for defence24.pl Therefore, it can be assumed that we will continue to send equipment to Ukrainians, but the opposition's declaration so far shows that these will no longer be such generous supplies because we have nothing left to give. In some time, we will certainly deliver another 30 Mig 29 and other prorad sieck equipment, but with and Solomon will not pour it out, and in the face of Russia's threats, we must also be ready for potential defense. It is also worth mentioning that we do not provide only weapons, but also humanitarian and infrastructural aid. The best proof of this is the fact that Rafał Trzaskowski announced at the beginning of November that Warsaw donated a total of 60 fully functional 81 series wagons that were withdrawn from everyday use with the arrival of new trains, older Warsaw metro trains are already carrying the inhabitants of Kiev, which the mayor of Warsaw shared on his Twitter or, if you prefer, on the x platform, even despite such gestures, considering As currently what bilateral relations look like, returning to the cooperation from the beginning of the conflict may turn out to be impossible, the proof of this is, of course, the Zbożów scandal and the submission of a complaint against Poland to the world trade organization on September 18 this year, the last hot dispute is also the blockade of the Polish-Ukrainian border by truck drivers this conflict turned out to be so crucial that the European Commission is even considering starting a criminal procedure against Poland. According to reports by rmffm journalists in Brussels, Polish drivers have been blocking three border crossings with Ukraine and adjacent roads for over a week, accusing the government of passivity and helplessness in the face of the losses suffered by Polish transport companies due to the need to compete with Ukrainian carriers after the outbreak of the war between Russia and Ukraine Poles are demanding a limit on the number of permits for Ukrainian trucks to enter the European Union, which is of course not agreed to Kiev police still won't let us go so that there won't be any short-circuit between drivers and Ukrainians sometimes come across sporadic cases where a boy's window was broken somewhere, he was just driving somewhere, not exactly. During the Polish-Ukrainian talks on November 13, it was not possible to reach an agreement on this matter, the Ukrainian delegation rejected Polish demands for restoring permits for commercial transport. Poland being one one of the most important transport companies in the European Union is incurring gigantic losses in making the market available to Ukrainian carriers, so far they performed about half of the transport on the Polish-Ukrainian border, currently they are responsible for over 90%, which generates gigantic losses, especially for the inhabitants of Podkarpacie due to the failure of these talks, Polish carriers announce that from November 20 they will begin a blockade of the medical terminal, which may last until January 3, this is a huge threat to interrupting the logistic chain of Ukraine, at the same time leading to significant economic destruction, which may be intensified by the upcoming winter, and the winter beyond our eastern border is already quite severe for the beginning November, the Russians will probably decide to use this moment to further weaken Ukraine. Especially since they have collected over 800 missiles in the annexed Crimea, it is highly probable that all these missiles will be used during the Energy Terror. Ukraine announced that 800 missiles, mainly of the I-caliber caliber, have already been concentrated on the occupied Peninsula. So nothing. It's no wonder that the Kiev authorities, knowing what may happen to them this winter, are trying to improve relations with Warsaw. Włodyki also expressed warm wishes to us on the occasion of Independence Day, informing at the same time how important Polish-Ukrainian cooperation is, especially when the ground is on fire, whether these wishes were sincere. It's hard to say . relations with our neighbors are based, as I said in previous films on the principle of give give give and the number of disputes is increasing An example of which is the current situation in connection with the carriers' protests, an understandable aspect is that the independence of Ukraine It is also important for Poland, but even more important for us Poles is the independence and independence of our homeland Please let us know in the comments what what do you think about curses because I'm curious about yours Thank you for today and until the next material Hold on and keep your fingers crossed for [Music] me and\",\n",
       " \"hello and welcome to the gritty and somewhat\\xa0\\nundiscovered city of Łódź in central poland\\xa0\\xa0 we were warned against visiting Łódź\\xa0\\nand that's exactly why we came here\\xa0\\xa0 so let's go and explore this city\\xa0\\nand see what it has to offer let's go now the first stop on our list today is the\\xa0\\nManufaktura here directly in the center of Łódź\\xa0\\xa0 this giant complex opened in the year of 2006 and\\xa0\\nbefore it was a textile factory now it's kind of\\xa0\\xa0 the center of commerce so you have a huge mall in\\xa0\\nthere it's a center of arts as well leisure you\\xa0\\xa0 have loads and loads of sporting events happening\\xa0\\nall around here maybe even concerts every now and\\xa0\\xa0 then so it's a huge area of 27 hectares that\\xa0\\nthey rebuilt um to make this great complex here\\xa0\\xa0 where everybody just kind of comes together now\\xa0\\nThe Manufaktura is an incredibly unique setting and\\xa0\\xa0 an absolutely massive shopping mall we actually\\xa0\\nhad a look through the shopping mall there just\\xa0\\xa0 the other day and there is an unlimited amount\\xa0\\nof things that you can do inside Manufaktura\\xa0\\xa0 they also have a cinema city as well which is\\xa0\\nabsolutely fantastic you have all of the recent\\xa0\\xa0 released movies in there and something that we\\xa0\\nhave noticed actually quite a bit about poland in\\xa0\\xa0 general is that they do love their movies there's\\xa0\\na cinema in every place that we've been in so far\\xa0\\xa0 and they love those IMAX kind of 4k\\xa0\\ncinematography as well and we love that as well we\\xa0\\xa0 definitely want to go and check a movie out soon i\\xa0\\nstill haven't seen top gun so that is on the list\\xa0\\xa0 but check this place out here there is sort of\\xa0\\na man-made beach just in front of Manufaktura\\xa0\\xa0 obviously set up for people to come chill out and\\xa0\\nmaybe play some ball sports as well look at this doesn't get much more unique interesting and or\\xa0\\nas cool as this now the mall side of manufaktura\\xa0\\xa0 is just absolutely massive and you actually can\\xa0\\nget lost here um the other day when we walked\\xa0\\xa0 through here i think we got lost several times and\\xa0\\nthen somehow ended up in the food court no idea\\xa0\\xa0 how we got there it was not our intention but we\\xa0\\nended up in the food court which is also amazing\\xa0\\xa0 but Manufaktura in general it offers a lot of\\xa0\\nstores that are very high-end such as just like\\xa0\\xa0 michael kors i believe gucci like these types of\\xa0\\nplaces but it also offers like low end like h&m or\\xa0\\xa0 maybe Pull&Bear and all of that good stuff\\xa0\\nso it does offer something for every wallet out\\xa0\\xa0 there now the opinion on Łódź is very mixed we\\xa0\\nhave received plenty of comments about Łódź some\\xa0\\xa0 of them saying that woods is the detroit of poland\\xa0\\nwe even had one comment saying to absolutely avoid\\xa0\\xa0 wood at all costs now that really intrigued us and\\xa0\\nit actually made us come and check this place out\\xa0\\xa0 as you know our as you can tell from a lot of our\\xa0\\nvideos that we make here on youtube we like to go\\xa0\\xa0 a little bit off the beaten path as often as we\\xa0\\ncan we don't typically stick to just the regular\\xa0\\xa0 tourist path there was plenty of comments as well\\xa0\\non a community post that we put up where people\\xa0\\xa0 said that they really think Łódź is underrated\\xa0\\nwe even put up a poll on that particular post\\xa0\\xa0 and it was split basically 50 50. 50 said Łódź is\\xa0\\nunderrated and a great city and the other 50 said\\xa0\\xa0 it's depressing and boring so that's what we're\\xa0\\nhere to find out is Łódź depressing or is wood an\\xa0\\xa0 underrated gem of poland the next stop on our list\\xa0\\nis Pasaż Róży or in english Rosas passage which\\xa0\\xa0 is a huge art art project where artists covered\\xa0\\naround 800 square meters of walls houses doorways\\xa0\\xa0 windows and all and everything around the house\\xa0\\nbasically in little broken mirror pieces and all\\xa0\\xa0 of the individual mirror pieces have a different\\xa0\\nsize so they were not broken in like squares or\\xa0\\xa0 something like that so that it makes it easy to\\xa0\\ncover basically it's just very individual broken\\xa0\\xa0 mirrors that have different sizes on the walls\\xa0\\nrosa's passage here in Łódź is fascinating and\\xa0\\xa0 it's fascinating for us and for me in fact because\\xa0\\nof the contrast that it shows between two parts of\\xa0\\xa0 Łódź now there's one part that is here behind\\xa0\\nme right now if you can see this building here\\xa0\\xa0 and this actual street here in general a lot\\xa0\\nof the buildings and a lot of the doorways\\xa0\\xa0 are kind of dilapidated a little bit old torn and\\xa0\\nhave certainly seen a lot throughout history and\\xa0\\xa0 then you also have rosas passage and it is just\\xa0\\nstunningly beautiful bright creative and it shows\\xa0\\xa0 that really inspiring new creative side to the\\xa0\\ncity of Łódź and there's also so many beautiful\\xa0\\xa0 roses and flowers that are surrounding rosa's\\xa0\\npassage as well such as these ones right here i'm really wondering here that in the summertime\\xa0\\nfor example when the sun gets really really strong\\xa0\\xa0 and broken and those little mirror pieces if\\xa0\\nit gets insanely hot here in the passage itself\\xa0\\xa0 or if maybe like little pieces of flowers\\xa0\\nhave been set on fire by the mirrors itself\\xa0\\xa0 or something like that and that would be really\\xa0\\ninteresting to know if you know that let us know\\xa0\\xa0 in the comments down below rosa's passage here in\\xa0\\nwoods is certainly one of the most unique places\\xa0\\xa0 that we've come across so far here in poland in\\xa0\\nterms of creativity and just purely showing how\\xa0\\xa0 creativity can uplift a certain area of a place\\xa0\\nsuch as the city of Łódź and we're gonna try and\\xa0\\xa0 see if we can get the drone up in the air and get\\xa0\\na bird's eye view of what this place looks like by the way today it was supposed to be only 22\\xa0\\ndegrees celsius and both of us were like okay\\xa0\\xa0 it's not that hot so we both\\xa0\\ndecided to go with hoodies\\xa0\\xa0 and i even put on some long pants\\xa0\\nand let me tell you something\\xa0\\xa0 we both regret it we're both sweating our\\xa0\\nlittle you know what's off it's very hot right now we are on the steps of this\\xa0\\nmagnificent looking church that is at\\xa0\\xa0 kind of the beginning of a very significant\\xa0\\nand important street here in the city of Łódź\\xa0\\xa0 Piotrkowska street now tell me if i'm pronouncing\\xa0\\nthat one wrong i think i might be okay with that\\xa0\\xa0 but speaking of pronunciations\\xa0\\nthis church um is called kościół Zesłania Ducha Świętego so that is a mouthful and that is something\\xa0\\nthat i certainly have pronounced wrong let me know\\xa0\\xa0 down below if i completely and utterly destroyed\\xa0\\nit um we looked it up on google maps there is no\\xa0\\xa0 actual english name for this church that is\\xa0\\nshowing on google maps but do let us know\\xa0\\xa0 what it translates to down below now we actually\\xa0\\nthought that the church was closed because all of\\xa0\\xa0 the doors were closed you know usually one of the\\xa0\\ndoors in the church this is usually open for the\\xa0\\xa0 people to walk in but somebody just walked out of\\xa0\\nthere very casually so i assume we can just go in\\xa0\\xa0 and check it out wow this church is absolutely\\xa0\\nstunning every single corner of it you can tell\\xa0\\xa0 that this building in general has gone through\\xa0\\nquite a lot throughout the ages you can see the\\xa0\\xa0 wear and tear on a lot of the walls and it is very\\xa0\\nbeautiful it definitely has not been touched up\\xa0\\xa0 in quite some time and you can see a lot of the\\xa0\\nstructures and a lot of the sort of engravings\\xa0\\xa0 on the walls are just magnificent and really\\xa0\\nreally just beautiful place to be the acoustics\\xa0\\xa0 in here are fantastic so i'd say attending\\xa0\\na mass in here would be amazing just with\\xa0\\xa0 the priest's voice echoing around this building\\xa0\\nit is a very tall building so ceiling kind of\\xa0\\xa0 carries up all the way around two or three floors\\xa0\\nit is quite a tall if you can see all the way up\\xa0\\xa0 and we are the only ones in this church right now\\xa0\\nwhich is quite an eerie feeling but it is very\\xa0\\xa0 beautiful and the lighting that's coming in those\\xa0\\nstunning church windows just gives it a really\\xa0\\xa0 sort of surreal and kind of cinematic feel as\\xa0\\nwe're walking around this beautiful church now we\\xa0\\xa0 are currently on Ulica Piotrkowska and this is\\xa0\\nthe one of the main tourist attractions of Łódź\\xa0\\xa0 because it is one of the longest commercially\\xa0\\nused streets in all of europe this street\\xa0\\xa0 here is 4.2 kilometers long there's nearly no\\xa0\\ntraffic you obviously have a lot of cyclists\\xa0\\xa0 and every now and then you do see a car for\\xa0\\ndeliveries i suppose for the shops but it's\\xa0\\xa0 predominantly for pedestrians and cyclists and all\\xa0\\nalong the street and 4.2 kilometers you just have\\xa0\\xa0 restaurants and cafes and clothing shops and\\xa0\\nplaces where you can buy books all of that\\xa0\\xa0 good stuff on a total of 4.2 kilometers which is\\xa0\\nabsolutely amazing and i do think if you ever come\\xa0\\xa0 to Łódź you should check out the street and walk\\xa0\\nthe entire distance the city of Łódź has a very\\xa0\\xa0 detailed and decorated history in the textile and\\xa0\\nmanufacturing industry and you can certainly see\\xa0\\xa0 that in a lot of the buildings as you were walking\\xa0\\ndown the main street of Piotrkowska Piotrkowska\\xa0\\xa0 street even though it is a main tourist attraction\\xa0\\nor one of the main tourist attractions of Łódź\\xa0\\xa0 and it brings a lot of people you can see that\\xa0\\nit's absolutely bustling and there's plenty of\\xa0\\xa0 people and cafes and restaurants etc and the vibe\\xa0\\nhere is really laid back but you do see remnants\\xa0\\xa0 and leftovers of the industrial industry and of\\xa0\\nthe history of the city of Łódź and then you\\xa0\\xa0 also see the comparison to that where there's new\\xa0\\nbuildings new businesses entrepreneurial different\\xa0\\xa0 setups sort of hipster cafes tattoo parlors all of\\xa0\\nthese sorts of things are kind of integrating into\\xa0\\xa0 the old industrial chic of the city and it really\\xa0\\ncreates a very unique and tasteful vibe to Łódź i think if you wanted to you could really spend\\xa0\\nall day here on Ulica Piotrkowska and what i\\xa0\\xa0 think is really really interesting is that you\\xa0\\nhave these small little alleyways and it's like\\xa0\\xa0 every like kind of second or third house that you\\xa0\\ncan go through and then on the other side you have\\xa0\\xa0 a lot more shops so like it's really interesting\\xa0\\nto just walk through all of the alleyways and kind\\xa0\\xa0 of see what's on the other side because i just saw\\xa0\\none where there was kind of like a hidden cafe or\\xa0\\xa0 maybe like hidden restaurants and all of that good\\xa0\\nstuff so i think it would be really interesting\\xa0\\xa0 to just spend an entire day just basically\\xa0\\nexperiencing and investigating the little\\xa0\\xa0 alleyways now for a city that so many people like\\xa0\\nto talk trash about i'm seeing an awful lot of\\xa0\\xa0 construction sites and plenty and plenty of money\\xa0\\nis going in and being invested into this city\\xa0\\xa0 to expand it and you can see it right now\\xa0\\nhere on Piotrkowska street this place is\\xa0\\xa0 absolutely thriving there's plenty of very new\\xa0\\nlooking restaurants plenty of beautiful cafes\\xa0\\xa0 and you can certainly see plenty of money in the\\xa0\\narea we saw quite a lot of new cars new bmw's etc\\xa0\\xa0 and a lot of the apartment buildings and blocks\\xa0\\naround here appear to be quite fancy as well so\\xa0\\xa0 Łódź it's really not that bad it's actually quite\\xa0\\nbeautiful from what we can see so far certain\\xa0\\xa0 areas in the city of woods gives you that really\\xa0\\nold-school type of as we said earlier industrial\\xa0\\xa0 style vibe but then you come to somewhere\\xa0\\nsuch as OFF Piotrkowska  it is basically a totally newly placed tons\\xa0\\nof different food stalls creative atmosphere\\xa0\\xa0 loads of sort of undiscovered underground new\\xa0\\nbrands locals that are selling their own recipes\\xa0\\xa0 stuff like that and it is absolutely astonishing\\xa0\\nto see the vibe here is just so much younger you\\xa0\\xa0 see a lot more young people hanging out around\\xa0\\nthis particular area and it's a really really cool\\xa0\\xa0 place and it seems like a nice place to come pop\\xa0\\nopen a beer on a beautiful sunny day such as today\\xa0\\xa0 lay out on some of these loungers and just take\\xa0\\nin the nice atmosphere in the city of Łódź now\\xa0\\xa0 OFF Piotrkowska this general area here is a space\\xa0\\nthat is used for various purposes so you do have\\xa0\\xa0 a lot of restaurants and bars but you also have\\xa0\\nloads of small kind of alternative shops where you\\xa0\\xa0 can get handcrafted goods and street food as well\\xa0\\nlots of street food stands but this general area\\xa0\\xa0 here was used as a cotton mill production factory\\xa0\\nup until 1990 so you still get kind of the vibe of\\xa0\\xa0 a kind of a cotton mill type of place so like\\xa0\\na factory feeling like with the red brick\\xa0\\xa0 walls as well and the big\\xa0\\nwindows with the with the metal\\xa0\\xa0 in front of it but it is made in a very\\xa0\\nvery nice way where everything kind of seems\\xa0\\xa0 very alternative and just not as the rest of the\\xa0\\ncity so this is a very special place to come to so we just had a little bit of a pit stop\\xa0\\nhere at galeria Łódź or galeria Łódźka\\xa0\\xa0 another shopping mall that you definitely should\\xa0\\ncheck out if you do get the time and if you are\\xa0\\xa0 in the vicinity of wood in central poland it is\\xa0\\none of the many shopping malls that you can find\\xa0\\xa0 we have actually just in this video been to three\\xa0\\ndifferent malls the first one was Manufaktura\\xa0\\xa0 then we went to off Piotrkowska and then you\\xa0\\nhave Galeria Łódźka and we basically went in\\xa0\\xa0 we went to like a polish buffet and there\\xa0\\nwas plenty of different things that you\\xa0\\xa0 could find there i went for like potato\\xa0\\npancakes some really good green beans\\xa0\\xa0 an amazing sauce and then i had like a kotlett\\xa0\\nas well and i picked up a glass of beer just to\\xa0\\xa0 something that's a little bit on the refreshing\\xa0\\nside poland has some really fantastic beers\\xa0\\xa0 we have a video from zakopane where we did a\\xa0\\nfood and beer tour and i got to sample some great\\xa0\\xa0 polish beer and ever since then i have really\\xa0\\njust loved the beer in poland and i actually got a\\xa0\\xa0 just a bottle of lech beer with that meal and it\\xa0\\nis a fantastic place to go if you are looking for\\xa0\\xa0 some good tasty cheap polish food in that zakopane\\xa0\\nvideo we actually got a little bit drunk i think\\xa0\\xa0 maybe a little bit too drunk to film a youtube\\xa0\\nvideo but we did it anyway so we got through it\\xa0\\xa0 but i what i wanted to add is that even though\\xa0\\nit is a mall food and it is a buffet type of food\\xa0\\xa0 it is really really tasty and very affordable as\\xa0\\nwell so i think i got like a schnitzel as well and\\xa0\\xa0 some of these potato pancakes with some spinach\\xa0\\nand some sauce and i think for the both of us\\xa0\\xa0 we paid something like 15 euro i want to say yeah\\xa0\\nsomething like that somewhere between 12 and 15.\\xa0\\xa0 yeah um fantastic food great little pit stop\\xa0\\nand we are on our way now to the i think it's\\xa0\\xa0 going to be possibly the final destination great\\xa0\\nmovie by the way but we are on our way to the last\\xa0\\xa0 destination oh my god in this video yeah woods if\\xa0\\nyou can't tell already it's a fantastic city very\\xa0\\xa0 underrated don't believe all of this bs around it\\xa0\\nbeing a down and dreary and gray there are parts\\xa0\\xa0 of it that are like that don't get us wrong the\\xa0\\nplace where we're staying outside of the center\\xa0\\xa0 it does look a little bit beaten but we're off\\xa0\\nto check another very cool part of the city\\xa0\\xa0 for sure let's do this now we are currently\\xa0\\ntaking a walk through the post-industrial area\\xa0\\xa0 of Fabryczna and this is where you will find\\xa0\\nthe 19th century alexander navski cathedral\\xa0\\xa0 as well as a stunning area which we are on our\\xa0\\nway to we popped it into google maps and hopefully\\xa0\\xa0 we will be there soon it's called i'm gonna\\xa0\\nabsolutely destroy this name Księży Młyn\\n red brick\\xa0\\xa0 post-industrial chic buildings very incredibly\\xa0\\nbeautiful and we are hoping fingers crossed\\xa0\\xa0 that we will get to come in explore this trendy\\xa0\\nlittle area that has been recommended to us so\\xa0\\xa0 many times by you guys down in the comments\\xa0\\nand on instagram as well actually and\\xa0\\xa0 wow we have just stumbled across the sign that\\xa0\\nis signaling the entrance to the area itself\\xa0\\xa0 i would just wanted to give it a shot\\xa0\\nat pronouncing it as well i believe it's because the ż is kind of like the\\xa0\\nżapka that so i kind of feel like it's anyway it kind of looks like it is the end stop of\\xa0\\na train here and so as you can see here you have\\xa0\\xa0 all of the train tracks and then\\xa0\\nyou have the beautiful sign for the\\xa0\\xa0 Księży Młyn area now this area here in english\\xa0\\npriests mill by the way was built since\\xa0\\xa0 the 1824 i believe if i read that correctly and\\xa0\\nremember that correctly but now it is more of a\\xa0\\xa0 mixed development type of area so like you\\xa0\\nhave loads of housing estates in this area\\xa0\\xa0 restaurants cafes offices so everything that\\xa0\\nŁódź possibly could meet you can find here\\xa0\\xa0 in this area but all of this used to be everything\\xa0\\nsurrounding textiles so loads and loads of\\xa0\\xa0 cotton spinning factories for example or other\\xa0\\ntextile type of factories that could just play\\xa0\\xa0 into the industry that Łódź kind of occupated\\xa0\\nin the 1800s walking through this area it's just\\xa0\\xa0 absolutely beautiful all these red brick houses\\xa0\\nthere's just something very special about\\xa0\\xa0 when all of the places in one small area just look\\xa0\\nidentical it just kind of has this weird strange\\xa0\\xa0 cinematic vibe to it where it just it's\\xa0\\nso photogenic and we didn't i personally\\xa0\\xa0 didn't think that people were actually living in\\xa0\\nthese buildings and then we just saw some people\\xa0\\xa0 standing outside having a cigarette in what is\\xa0\\ntheir front garden which is this beautiful walkway\\xa0\\xa0 um big open green space in front of their house\\xa0\\nas well and this whole area just as naomi was\\xa0\\xa0 briefly saying there you've got restaurants\\xa0\\nand everything that you could need and\\xa0\\xa0 the setting is just out of this world\\xa0\\nit's just so post-industrial sort of new\\xa0\\xa0 vibe to it as well because there's so much\\xa0\\ncreativeness going on and there's plenty of sort\\xa0\\xa0 of hipster style cafes there's a Delikatesy\\xa0\\nplace just that i'm looking at right now 24 hours\\xa0\\xa0 store where you can get everything you need\\xa0\\nalcohol-wise food-wise anything you could want\\xa0\\xa0 this place is really cool and it's definitely\\xa0\\nadded to your list as soon as you can if you\\xa0\\xa0 are planning on visiting the city of Łódź now\\xa0\\nas luke was saying all of these red brick\\xa0\\xa0 houses certainly feel like you just stepped into\\xa0\\nlike a movie set or something and all of a sudden\\xa0\\xa0 you are like part of a movie that takes place\\xa0\\nsomewhere in the 1850s or something like that\\xa0\\xa0 and but i personally really really feel like all\\xa0\\nof these red brick houses are kind of like an\\xa0\\xa0 empty canvas and it gives you it gives your own\\xa0\\ncreativity enough space to kind of flourish like\\xa0\\xa0 it really feels like you want to get creative\\xa0\\nas soon as you touch this area alright so to be\\xa0\\xa0 100% honest with you guys when we came to Łódź\\xa0\\nfor the first time meaning just a few days ago\\xa0\\xa0 i had the impression that around 50 of people\\xa0\\nhave about Łódź and i genuinely thought that it\\xa0\\xa0 was boring gray kind of depressing there wasn't\\xa0\\nreally much to do i was walking around Łódź\\xa0\\xa0 with naomi and looking around and being like\\xa0\\nwhy would someone come here but now after\\xa0\\xa0 today after exploring around after truly immersing\\xa0\\nourselves into the city of Łódź i can really see\\xa0\\xa0 the other side of the coin and i can see that\\xa0\\nwood is absolutely an underrated gem of a city\\xa0\\xa0 and it's somewhere actually that i would say that\\xa0\\nyou need to visit as soon as you possibly can\\xa0\\xa0 a lot of these cities such as Kraków Gdansk\\xa0\\nall of this type of stuff they always\\xa0\\xa0 make the same lists and people year after\\xa0\\nyear visit poland then they go to the tatras\\xa0\\xa0 they go to morskie oko we went to morskie oko\\xa0\\nwe went to the tatras zakopane kraków check\\xa0\\xa0 check check they check off all of these amazing\\xa0\\nplaces and all of those places are absolutely\\xa0\\xa0 must visit destinations we we don't deny that but\\xa0\\nthey leave places like Łódź places like katowice\\xa0\\xa0 and plenty of other amazing parts of poland just\\xa0\\nseemingly drop off of people's lists and that's\\xa0\\xa0 why we came here to this city and to be honest\\xa0\\nmy first impression is you're either gonna love\\xa0\\xa0 this place or you're going to absolutely hate this\\xa0\\nplace and for me right now i am somewhere leaning\\xa0\\xa0 towards loving it what do you think i absolutely\\xa0\\nagree with this i do think in the beginning we\\xa0\\xa0 had a little bit of a negative impression\\xa0\\nof Łódź as well because kind of the first\\xa0\\xa0 i want to say four days it was just raining so\\xa0\\nlike it was really gray and we were kind of just\\xa0\\xa0 sitting in our airbnb not really knowing what to\\xa0\\ndo couldn't go outside we were just seeing this\\xa0\\xa0 gray image outside of our window um we're also not\\xa0\\nstaying in the best area so we have to add that\\xa0\\xa0 but i do think Łódź overall definitely is a\\xa0\\nvery unique place and it's very different like\\xa0\\xa0 it feels different to the rest of poland as well\\xa0\\nin a very unique way so i think you will either\\xa0\\xa0 going you you're either going to resonate with\\xa0\\nthe city or you won't but i do agree with luke\\xa0\\xa0 there i do think it's i resonate more towards the\\xa0\\npositive i do think Łódź is definitely worth\\xa0\\xa0 visiting maybe not for two or three weeks but\\xa0\\ndefinitely for like a weekend trip or like four\\xa0\\xa0 days or something like that i think that would be\\xa0\\nenough for Łódź but you should put it on your list\\xa0\\xa0 just to kind of see this beautiful and very very\\xa0\\nunique part of earth but i think that is it from\\xa0\\xa0 us today you guys we are going to order another\\xa0\\nbolt now in order to get home because we walked\\xa0\\xa0 so far today that we don't want to walk all\\xa0\\nthe way back or find the next train i'd say no\\xa0\\xa0 yeah believe it or not a Łódź i think is\\xa0\\nthe third largest city in poland you wouldn't\\xa0\\xa0 actually believe that but as we walked around\\xa0\\ntoday we walked a considerable amount i think\\xa0\\xa0 easily covered like 10 or 12 kilometers today\\xa0\\nalone and we still haven't even seen like a\\xa0\\xa0 third of the city itself um so so many of you\\xa0\\nkeep telling us in the comments and you haven't\\xa0\\xa0 even seen the great part of the city it's like\\xa0\\nyeah but we already walked 20 kilometers yeah\\xa0\\xa0 poland is a big place yeah but um we've been\\xa0\\nusing bolt and some of you guys that might\\xa0\\xa0 have watched our Bielsko-Biała series we used\\xa0\\nbolts to get to some places there so we're\\xa0\\xa0 going to be using one now to get back home to our\\xa0\\naccommodation definitely guys come and check Łódź\\xa0\\xa0 out as soon as you can my name is luke my name\\xa0\\nis naomi we are the two mad explorers and this\\xa0\\xa0 is your daily reminder to keep exploring see you\\xa0\\nguys in the next video thanks for watching ciao

       " 'These were the final words that were captured\\non the Cockpit Voice Recording on board LOT Polish Airlines Flight 5055. Translated from Polish into English this reads... “Goodnight, goodbye. Bye, we are dying”. These haunting final words came at the very\\nend of a struggle to save the lives of 183. The case Flight 5055 is one where a lot of\\nthings went wrong. On May 9th, 1987, this large passenger plane\\nfell out of the sky following a devastating catastrophic failure within the plane’s\\nengines. What followed was a desperate struggle from\\nthe pilots to save the plane from crashing. Ultimately this resulted in the deadliest\\nair disaster in Poland’s history. But it’s how it got to this point is what\\nwe need to examine further. Because hidden away beneath this surface of\\nthis plane’s skin, is certain type of failure that occurred at multiple levels, mechanical\\nand financial. The date was May 9th, 1987. At Warsaw in Poland a large passenger plane\\nwas preparing for a long flight to the United States that morning. That day was a Saturday, and it was a warm\\nsunny clear day. The perfect day to go flying. LOT Flight 5055 was the chartered flight from\\nWarsaw to San Francisco via New York. A total of 172 passengers would be taking\\nthe flight that day. LOT Polish Airlines in the 1970s had launched\\ntheir first transatlantic flights connecting Poland with the United States. At that time during the cold war and under\\nthe Soviet sphere of influence, LOT didn’t much choice in sourcing a long range airliner,\\nthe plane they ended up with was the Ilyushin iL62. When the Il62 first took to the skies in the\\nearly 1960s it was actually for a time the largest passenger plane around. It has four rear mounted engines giving it\\na rather distinctive look. For air carriers in Eastern Europe and beyond,\\nthe iL-62 was the answer for long range operations. Its also a plane that LOT has had some history\\nwith. In 1980 Flight 007, one of their iL62s crashed\\nnearby to the airport here in Warsaw killing 87 people. Following an investigation into that accident\\nrevealing the cause to be linked to manufacturing and design defects in the aircraft’s engines,\\nthe airline sought to modernize the iL62 fleet by replacing them with the newer iL62M. The updated version of the plane that first\\nstarted flying in 1974 featured a number of improvements to the aircraft, including a\\nredesigned flight deck. Modifications to the wings were also made,\\nintroducing a newer spoiler system and increased fuel capacity. Above all the biggest change to this plane\\nwas different engines. The Soloviev D-30 engines would find their\\nway onto a number of the most popular planes ever to come out of the Soviet Union, including\\nthe massive Ilyushin IL76 and the ever popular Tupolev 154. The engines being the source of disaster in\\nthe 1980 incident, LOT replaced all of their older IL62s with these newer models. The story and the specific details about the\\ndisaster of LOT Flight 007 is best saved for another day. Re-directing our attention back to Warsaw\\nin 1987, this particular aircraft was built in 1983 so it was a fairly new plane at the\\ntime. Taking command of the large plane that day\\nwas 59-year-old Captain Zygmunt Pawlaczyk. That day was supposed to be a day off for\\nthe captain but he stepped in to cover another Captain. He was an exceptionally experienced with nearly\\n20,000 total flight hours to his name. He had spent over 10 years in the cockpit\\nof the IL62 by the time of the accident. Sat in the right seat was the much younger\\n44-year-old First Officer Leopold Karcher. Now these old Soviet Airliners typically required\\nup to five people to fly. In this case there were 6 men in the cockpit. Also on the flight deck was a Flight Engineer,\\n43-year-old Wojciech Kłossek 47-year-old Lesław Łykowski was sat in the navigators\\nposition. Handling the radios was 43-year-old Leszek\\nBogdan. And finally, the last member of crew was in\\nan observation role. 53-year-old Ryszard Chmielewski\\nWith a total of 11 crew members on board the flight’s total occupants was brought to\\n183. Now with setting up the scene here when looking\\ninto this Disaster, the conversation certainly can’t miss the extraordinary stroke of luck\\nthat was given to one passenger who was supposed to be on the flight. One Janina Szulc-Tomaszewska was a New Jersey\\nresident and was travelling home after visiting family in Poland. During her trip she purchased an expensive\\nmink coat. In Warsaw airport, she didn’t know that\\nshe needed to declare the item. Now Flight 5055 was a sold out flight, every\\nseat was booked but there was an additional overbooked passenger let’s just say, who\\nhappened to be acquainted with a Customs Officer in Warsaw airport. This Customs Officer, basically decided to\\ndo this individual a solid and free up a seat for them. Janina Szulc-Tomaszewska was singled out by\\nthe customs officer as she didn’t declare this expensive fur. She missed the flight because of it. Though she argued with airport personnel in\\nWarsaw, she didn’t know it at the time but her failure to file the appropriate documents\\nand declare her item had just saved her life. At 10:07 in the morning on May 9th, 1987,\\nFlight 5055 pushed back from the gate in Warsaw. The airport layout in Warsaw has not changed\\nmuch since 1987. Flight 5055 was taxied down to the South side\\nof the airport for a northerly departure from Runway 33. Now this is a case we actually have an Air\\nTraffic Control Recording for. What you are about to hear are the actual\\nwords that were exchanged between the plane and the control tower that morning. Using this recording we can gain a further\\nunderstand as to how the following events unfolded. -atc recording\\nAfter take-off, the pilots were given a heading from the departure controller. Heading 290. Additionally, the controllers cleared the\\nflight to climb up to 28,000 feet, flight level 280. As the plane climbed there was some conflict\\nof airspace between the plane and nearby military airspace. When Flight 5055 first accepted the departure\\nclearances on the ground, among the conditions in the clearance was to reach 18,000 feet\\nbefore reaching a certain waypoint as the plane flew out Northwest of Warsaw. It turned out in this case that they were\\nbelow this threshold which may have posed a risk of a midair collision as training exercises\\nwere being conducted that day and military and civilian radio communications were segregated. This exchange was recorded... -atc recording – airspace conflict\\nAs a result of this exchange, the pilots sought to increase their climb rate and thus increased\\nthe throttles to maximum power. The throttle setting would stay at this higher\\nsetting for around 9 minutes. Soon the Departure controller handed them\\noff to another frequency and said goodbye. -atc recording\\n-pause The \\nrecording here on this controllers end is extremely muffled, I have done my best here\\nto raise the frequencies of this Polish controller’s vocals. The new controller clears the flight to a\\nhigher altitude up to 31,000 feet. -atc recording\\nThe  time was 10:40. LOT Polish Airlines Flight 5055 was passing\\nover the town of Grudziądz, about 110 miles Northwest of Warsaw, about 50 miles south\\nof Gdansk. They reported an altitude of 26 and a half\\nthousand feet as they continued their further climb up to 31,000. In the cabin, the flight attendants were preparing\\ntheir service for the passengers. Hanna Chęcińska was one of the five flight\\nattendants on the flight. She was positioned in the very rear of the\\nplane, in that space that is between the two sets of engines. Disaster would strike the plane very soon,\\njust as passengers began settling into the The following segment of the ATC recording\\nwill give us a window into the moment catastrophe struck the plane, let’s play out this section\\nof the recording before going into detail on what exactly happened here. -atc recording\\nNow that was the ATC recording, we also have the cockpit voice recording transcript from\\nthe moment the failure occurred. From the ATC recording and the CVR transcript,\\nwhat we have learnt is that, from the pilot’s perspective, two of the plane’s four engines,\\nthe two on the left side had malfunctioned, failed, at that moment the pilots really had\\nno idea into the specifics. They knew however that there was an explosion,\\nan explosive decompression and a suspected fire. As you heard the controller suspected a collision\\nof some kind, the pilots weren’t sure. Now this is the crux of the situation, the\\nkey question to answer. What happened to these engines, well more\\nspecifically the issue was actually just with one engine. What the pilots didn’t know was that an\\nuncontained engine failure had just occurred with the number 2 engine. That is on the Il62 the inner engine on the\\nleft side. Now an uncontained engine failure could occur\\nfor any one of a multitude of reasons, the history of aviation history is littered with\\nsuch events. But to distinguish it from a contained engine\\nfailure, the uncontained scenario involves parts of the engine’s internals being ejected\\noutside of the engine housing. This is what happened on this flight, and\\nit can’t really be overstated just how catastrophic this failure was for reasons we’ll get into\\nsoon. But first lets unpack the details of this\\nspecific case of an Uncontained engine failure. In this case, the low pressure engine shaft\\ninside engine number 2, had succumbed to excessive heat damage. This led to a total failure and disintegration\\nof the shaft and the engine internals as a whole. The next question is how this heat was generated\\nin the first place. For that we have to understand what this thing\\nis. This is a roller bearing. These are found in all types of engines you\\ncan even find them in the engine of your car. They can also be found inside of airplane\\nengines; the number of these bearings varies on the engine model. They are used to give support and bear loads\\nwhich can minimize friction within an engine. The roller bearings on the Soloviev D30 engines\\nare supposed to be fitted with a total of 26 of these cylindrical individual roller\\nparts to make up the larger component. Now we are only interested in one of the roller\\nbearings. and turbines. What was later determined by investigators\\nwhen looking through the wreckage of the plane was that this bearing in addition to the others\\nrelated to engine number two were fitted with only half of the necessary rolling parts. 13 as apposed to the normal 26. LOT Polish Airlines knew about this but allowed\\nthe engine to go into service as there was a delay on the shipment of newer bearings\\nand they needed the engine. It was revealed many years after the Iron\\nCurtain fell, that Lot was known to have employed cost cutting practices in the operation of\\ntheir planes, especially when it came to their engines. Something that people have linked to this\\ndisaster in the years since. Furthermore, an additional modification in\\nthe form of multiple drilled holes into the critical bearing at fault was supposed to\\nbe a method to supply lubrication to the bearing. Instead it acted as more of a point of weakness\\nand fatigue. This enabled an environment where the engine\\nshaft was experiencing temperatures in excess of 1000 degrees Celsius. The component that should have helped support\\nthe shaft and reduce friction had deteriorated the engine shaft to such a poor condition\\nthat on that fateful day, it broke. This was following the 9 minute period of\\nmaximum applied thrust demanded from the pilots to allow them to climb faster. This is how the uncontained engine failure\\noccurred. At the onset of the failure, the pilots immediately\\nexperienced the human effects of decompression. Just when the pilots were settling into their\\nlong flight, they suddenly received warnings indicating an engine fire; the number one\\nand two engines were down. The explosive force of the failure had sent\\ndebris from the failed engine through into the neighboring number one engine. As a result the two left side engines were\\nbasically destroyed in this moment. Additionally, vital hydraulic flight control\\nlines were severed in the process. Other debris fractured the skin of the aircraft\\nand teared a hole at the rear of the fuselage, depressurizing the cabin. Numerous electrical failures occurred across\\nthe plane including the failure of the fire detection system in the lower cargo deck where\\na fire began to burn. It was at that moment of failure that Flight\\nAttendant Hanna Chęcińska positioned in the space between the engines was killed,\\nshe was the first fatality. According to Polish sources, during the crisis\\nthat followed about four minutes before the crash a flight attendant was reported to have\\nwent on record on the cockpit voice recording to say they couldn’t find her. Hanna from that moment on was missing. Her body was never found at the eventual crash\\nsite which meant her fate could have been one of two possibilities. One she was ejected from the plane following\\nthe decompression. Or two, she was either stuck in the back of\\nthe plane and burned in the fire. Or possibly was injured or killed directly\\nfrom debris from the faulting engine. Either way her remains were never recovered\\nor were unrecognizable at the scene of disaster... Captain Pawlaczyk with his 20,000 flight hours,\\nnow needed to put his knowledge and experience of flying to work. He began to turn the plane around for a return\\nto Warsaw. After swiftly identifying the decompression,\\nhe began to descend to a lower altitude so himself, his crew and passengers could safely\\nbreath. During the turn to the right the captain discovered\\nthat this situation was worse than he thought, as if this couldn’t get any worse. The flight controls were rather unresponsive. The rudder and the elevators weren’t working. They did have control of the ailerons and\\ncould still steer the plane where it needed to go, and they did have some pitch control\\nby use of trim. But this wasn’t enough to effectively manipulate\\nthe pitch with such a heavy plane on just two engine. Flight 5055 would now continue to descend\\nagainst the pilot’s will. Additionally we should note that four minutes\\nafter the crisis began, the indicated engine fire was extinguished. The Il62 was equipped with an automated engine\\nfire extinguishing system. But there were still fires in other parts\\nof the plane that would continue to burn and spread. The pilots had no idea of this due to the\\nelectrical outage shutting off much of the fire detection systems. Lets continue with the recording. -atc recording\\nThey needed to jettison fuel to prevent an overweight landing. Also, the reason why the pilots elected Warsaw\\nto be the return airport as opposed to the nearer Gdansk, this was likely to give them\\na bit of time to actually jettison the fuel. But there was a problem, the electrical failures\\nacross the plane had left some connection issues between the cockpit and electrically\\npowered Fuel dumping system. They couldn’t dump the fuel right away. It took several minutes for the jettison system\\nto actually begin the dump and over 30 tons of fuel was released from the plane. 10:51. The pilots were struggling to keep control\\nof their aircraft. they continuously were losing altitude and\\nwith minimal flight controls a radio call goes out to try and get them into a nearer\\nairport. Northwest of Warsaw is Modlin airport. At the time it was a military airfield, but\\nair travellers today will know this as the Warsaw airport served by Ryanair. -atc recording\\nThe controller would spend one minute trying to contact Modlin for clearance. -atc recording\\nThe situation onboard the stricken plane would only continue to deteriorate. The pilots were unaware of the fire that was\\nin the cargo hold. As mentioned earlier an electrical failure\\nhad cut off the fire detection systems in the cargo bay. The fire continued to burn without interference. In the cabin passengers were absolutely aware\\nof how dire their situation was. Some passengers even took time to write notes\\nof goodbye that would later be found in the wreckage. At 10:53 Flight 5055 would enquire again about\\nthe option of landing in Modlin. -atc recording\\nEventually the flight received clearance to land at the Modlin base and requested that\\ncontrollers use their radar to guide them to the airport. However, the plane had descended beyond a\\npoint where it could not be picked up on the radar of the higher altitude controllers. With radar contact lost, the crew were sent\\nradar information to try and locate the Modlin air field. They were once again put back in touch with\\nWarsaw approach where they made contact at 10:58. With each passing minute, the captain evidently\\nhad doubts about the idea of landing here. Though it was a closer airport, the emergency\\nservices were better quipped at Warsaw. At precisely 11:00 the pilots made the call\\nto fly directly to Warsaw’s main airport. -atc recording\\nThe controller gave them a vector south of the airport, this was in preparation for landing\\non Runway 33, from the south The controller offers the pilots an approach\\nonto runway 11. Which would mean they could fly almost directly\\ninto the airport from their heading approaching Warsaw from the North West regardless of the\\nwind conditions. This would decrease the flying time and get\\nthem on the ground sooner. Captain Pawlaczyk did have some doubts about\\nthis and requested wind information. Upon hearing that the straight in approach\\nwould include a 22 kilometer per hour tailwind, he elected to fly the Runway 33 approach from\\nthe south instead, using the same runway they used to take off. The crew were rather adamant about that with\\ncontrollers. -atc recording\\n11:08, Flight 5055 was roughly 15 kilometers from the airport. They were being directed south of the airport. The plan was for the plane to brought in with\\na left turn to line up for the runway. It is here that we reach the endgame of the\\ncrisis. The fire that had continued to burn throughout\\nthe plane was now indicated to the pilots has it can spready to the right side engines. It was burning and eating its way through\\nthe remaining flight control systems. They would communicate that they were now\\nhaving difficult with turning the plane. In the final moments of the flight, as they\\ntried to wrestle the plane toward the airport, they’d drift off course. Visible from the ground many looked up into\\nthe clear sky to observe the crippled plane in its final moments. -atc recording\\nIn the final seconds of the flight, Flight 5055 would transmit their final message. The transmission gives us a small glimpse\\nin the chaos that had now descended in the cockpit. They’d transmit their final words as all\\ncontrol was now lost. The final descent toward the ground, brought\\nthe Ilyushin jet into the Kabaty wood just a few kilometers from the airport. -atc recording. Ending. Out of control in a nose down attitude, LOT\\nPolish Airlines Flight 5055 crashed into the woods. All 183 people on board the plane, were now\\ndead. Had the flight crew had just one to two more\\nminutes, they might have made it. Very quickly following the crash, first responders\\nhad arrived only to witness the horrifying scene of plane wreckage. The crash had carved a path through the forest. Some even noticing the human remains tangled\\nin the trees. Some sources have speculated on the thought\\nprocess of the captain in the final seconds before the crash. In this desperate dire situation it may have\\nbecome apparent that there was no way with such little control that they could have guided\\nthe plane to safety. Even in 1987, there were populated surrounding\\nthe Kabaty Woods, beyond the end of the trees from where the plane was heading lays the\\ndensely populated neighborhood of the same name. Kabaty around this time was experiencing large\\npopulation growth as people moved into newly constructed apartment blocks. It is the belief of some that Captain Pawlaczyk\\nusing what little flight controls he had left crashed the plane into the woods on purpose\\nto prevent further loss to human life. The investigation that followed had to be\\nconducted without much help from the aircraft’s manufacturer in the Soviet Union. Ilyushin only supplied the most basic of information\\nand their co-operation in the investigation was limited. Polish investigators established that this\\naccident bore a striking resemblance to aforementioned disaster Flight 007 which occurred 7 years\\npreviously, both disasters were the result of an Uncontained engine failure. An even earlier similar incident, the Königs\\nWusterhausen Disaster of 1972 was a case of an inflight fire, albeit for different reasons,\\nthat destroyed the flight controls leading to the deaths of 156 people. For more information consider watching our\\nvideo on that disaster. These types of uncontained engine failures\\nare devastating and airplane manufacturers over the years have taken great steps in preventing\\nthese types of accidents. United Airlines Flight 232 is another case\\nthat had many similarities to that of Lot 5055. Polish investigators forwarded their findings\\nto Moscow with a number of recommendations including the addition of an engine vibration\\ngauge on the Il62, something that was actually raised when the first crash occurred. The modernizing of the plane’s fire and\\nsmoke detection equipment was also recommended. At that time, LOT was unable to purchase planes\\nfrom Western manufacturers such as Boeing and Airbus. Behind the iron curtain their options were\\nlimited to Soviet planes. This changed at the end of the 1980s and the\\nairline eventually retired the Il62 plane in 1992.

       " \"when you say you're going to do something do it boom josh luja what's up people hola vigozad here welcome to another episode i see all these youtubers making videos about what not to do in poland don't make these mistakes in poland i'm actually happy that they're making those videos because at the end of the day what we want is to showcase poland and to make sure that more people out there can see the beautiful country that poland is and the great people the polish people are but when i think about the things that you should not do in poland i think we need to go deeper so come with me and let's see what are the real things that you should not do in poland if there's one thing that you're going to avoid doing on this list this is the one don't refuse a bad chess offering polish people are very well known for their hospitality they are incredible hosts they're welcoming and they love to share their things with people especially things that have been crafted and a lot of time has been put into it food is a very big one and this traces back to the times of war of course all this has been extremely well documented but if you didn't know back during war times it would be weeks before people would have any option whatsoever at the grocery store unlike today you were not choosing between a bread with seven seeds baked in a mediterranean stone oven or the gluten-free loaf designed in america but assembled in vietnam only sold in american spencers to the first 100 people and even with this scarcity polish people were splitting in half whatever little they had to share with whoever might need it a great example of this is during polish vigilia there's always an extra space at the table for an unexpected visitor that might need some shelter it is a generation thing polish grandmas although a little old and maybe a little tired will always find strength and time to show love and usually they do that by giving you things especially food you don't need fish oh you're on a diet you're vegan you're vegan that's a lot of butter [Music] don't worry about being nice be consistent be reliable depending where you're traveling to and where you're from this may vary but it's quite a general rule that whenever you go to a place it pays off to be polite to be cheerful to be nice it's not the polish people don't like it when you're nice but that concept is a little bit different when you're in poland i myself i'm very guilty of that i can smile all day long and i can compliment people left and right but i'm still going to get long faces and awkward stares if i don't comply with the single most important rule in a relationship with a polish person and that is to be consistent and to be reliable if you say you're going to do something do it if you said you're going to be there at three don't show up at four and if you committed to helping a friend that you were just trying to be nice don't do it or you lose all respect of polish people honestly speaking some of the things they say to you can come off as pretty damn rude if you don't know the reason why they do it then you might feel a little bit like hey cuba can you help me put together furniture this weekend nope i don't have time cold but you see it's not that they're really rude is that they don't want to commit to something that they might not keep their word on they really don't want to come off as unreliable same thing goes with consistency if you say you don't like something don't be changing your mind because people will take your word for it [Music] stop all that fairy tale bull and let's complain together if there's one thing the polish people love more than vodka and pierrot is to complain but here's the thing there's an art form to complaining in poland there are certain rules that you have to adhere to there's nothing more irritating to a pole than someone that comes off as overly happy and just overall fake your friend had a terrible day a job we're in the middle of the pandemic their son is sick the last thing you should say to them is benja dobje you throw yes no vegeta oh don't even try instead share how you also had a shitty day and he will feel understood polish people value community so they rejoice on the feeling that they belong to a bigger picture so the infamous polish complaining it's nothing more than them looking for a connection with others so next time you hear someone grumble show some camaraderie and let them know how you're also going through something similar as counterproductive as this might sound i promise you in the end they will give you a big smile if you want to go to the next level with polish people don't just go for the words go for the body language it is true that polish language is one of the hardest languages to learn so when a foreigner learns a couple of words you'll get a few surprise faces and even a couple paddings in the back although let's face it polish people don't touch so much and having said that we're in the year 2020 we are in the times of millennials of gen zed and you get more and more youtube videos showcasing poland the wonders that you can find in this beautiful country which means it's not uncommon to find some foreigner learning to say david dania or jen kuya but for the life of me learned that it's not pierogis it's pierrogi it's already in plural form there are some serious unique body language cues that if you master them polish people will hand you the keys to the city number one the polish shoulder shrug never attack attack number two the circle of trust polish people have what i call a circle of trust it's an imaginary ring that goes all the way around them where they feel uncomfortable whatever is close to this imaginary ring let's say this is a person if that person comes inside my ring that is a no-no and number three voice volume and polite interruption for me to explain voice volume and polite interruption i'm gonna need carolina's help okay guys so like i said i need her help to clarify this particular polish body language trait we're talking about volume of voice and what i call polite interruption okay so for example polish people speak loud not as dominican we yell but you guys are for example in a public transportation oh yeah and you're there on the phone hello mama yeah exactly why does that happen why does it happen when they were loud i don't think anyone has the answer to this question okay so for example if foreigner that is going to start incorporating some of that polishness what should i do like for example to me it's very hard to speak when people are listening to me so i'm like i'll call you later i think it's more important that in a group that you learn to deal with the interruption interruption that takes us to the second part which is polite interruption polish people interrupt i love how they called it each other i call it polite because they don't mean you know you guys don't mean to interrupt people as in like rule like shut up it's more like we are speaking in a group of people here and all of a sudden right yeah interjection so like what i'm doing now to you there you go so learn that one the final thing is think like a pole not like a tourist it's so common to hear tourists say poland is so cheap everything is so affordable the food is delicious what an amazing nature and all of that is true but polish people know this and this is my particular opinion and they're not gonna say anything because they are very humble people but there's a lot more to being polish there's a lot more to poland and frankly there's a lot more things that probably you should not do in poland than what i can cover in one video but if you want to get closer to the beautiful group of human beings that polish people are i think it's important you start thinking like a pole when you go over to visit get off the beaten path explore the villages talk to the local people they love meeting foreigners because at the end of the day long gone are the days where societies remain closed polish people want to explore the world polish people want the world to explore them so come on over and enjoy the pleasures of poland boom that's all guys that's the end of the episode i hope you enjoyed it i'm going to ask you to share this with a friend it doesn't matter if it's polish doesn't matter where they're from and to be honest with you if you're a pole cut me a break man i'm one of you\",\n",
       " \"Radio that makes you think this is the Brian kilmeade show. >> They welcome back everyone is my privilege to have in studio the president of Poland Andrzej duda, president of the Republican pollens really since 2014, isn't it remarkable job in stepped up big time when this Ukraine war started his country has taken in about a million Ukrainians Mister president welcome to the show. But this of this new term have been out of that thought I mean this is great you and all our listeners and viewers. >> How is Poland. >> Been able to absorb the million Ukrainians and what has been the greatest challenge for your country as after Russia's invasion. >> Double a little said that was a really hard said nobody has really have to encourage pulse my compatriots to welcome refugees from a crane into their homes as we call them guests in Poland. Kiddos as out when Russia attacked Ukraine launching a full-scale attack as we put it on the 24th of February 2022 to still go. Well indeed a huge flight of refugees says started to move towards the Polish border we opened up our border immediately trying to let as many people get through as possible to make it available for the biggest possible number of people to flee from the area switched Russia was attacking because right from the start of that war, it's Russia has been personally attacking someone neighborhoods is not only military targets right from the start they carried out brutal miss I'll ever rates of fake neighborhoods in big grand citizen her cave in Kiev and in other places also close to the Polish border in Novi Finn let's go back a bull got a couple of months so there are a lot of such attacks and people are fleeing just like at indeed they were well Camden police homes down and it is just an anonymous said people whom they have never known took them. Polls went to the border to those speed all home they invited them and supported them that was just at reflects of the heart so to say we know simply what it means that somebody is suffering one summed it talked, especially by Russians unfortunately, this is a part of our history, a big part of our history and Opening of the heart's was just needed was just a reflex it was pretty amazing to see. You are also the first nation to give the Ukrainians fighter jets. >> And they need more fighter jets don't they. >> Mitch because I guess and we have the transfer to Ukraine as night Yang says size big parts of our moments exist forced winds the biggest existence of course is coming from the United States and being neighbors to grand never met a grateful for that to the U.S. authorities for that help for that support to Ukraine without this support Ukraine would not survive and there's no doubt about that they wouldn't be able to defend themselves. It is not only about and the bravery off granite soldiers which is wonderful that it is also a matter of having things to find a way it wasn't a fight with so right from the start we are also sending armaments to Ukraine the one rent soldiers were able to use right away that was important at this at the outset they have no experience whatsoever with a Western American military Jenna quick mental French equipment box and they were very good using apps so it Iraq Russian equipment that is why we sent right away Nick, 29 jets that would put them at the disposal of Ukrainian and soldiers and they had the pilots were able to fly those planes right away we sent more than 300 tanks to Ukraine mainly these were. The post-soviet era tanks but we modernize them in Poland and they had to add strength ours and also communication systems were high quality wins and they were well acquainted and ready to fight week sent more than 300 such tax loss also leopard tanks later on and produced by Germany we organized black at 10 coalition or an arm a collision as we call it that way. Also and talk to everybody and convinced everyone upon the request of Ukraine to send modern tanks to rain, the tanks weight check where I'm at tanks of the 21st century. And indeed we were implementing the Powell the Times of the longer among the 3 states will actually be the biggest military assistance to Ukraine is that the U.S. and that was a huge effort as we are doing that also in order to strengthen Polish security because we know that Russian imperialism has to be stopped to us this is of key importance to make sure that you Grant can defend itself. So that Russians are not able to can carry a crane said that they did not to say to crane Ukraine has to defend itself and I make an appeal to everyone to support Ukraine because the promise of international law has to be reinstated and you notice that to happen Russian troops have to be driven out from the Greenland Ukraine has to recover control of its internationally recognized borders, so we've given 70 billion dollars. But everything we give seems late. Hi Mars late Patriot 15 trainings late. >> The cluster bombs late the javelin missiles late, the tanks 31 not one has arrived. How hard has it been on the Ukrainians because it seems like we are always late. So that she can publish his book said person from a staff assistance is needed and it's positive that the assistance is being given I'm always saying well we need to appreciate that because without a military support, especially with modern equipment. Grant would not be able to defend itself. >> The problem that the grants are facing is not only the so-called military techniques or technology simply said weapons. There's also another thing, Russia simply is the Russians on much more numerous than Ukrainians what are you saying at does not care for the life of his soldiers, his hands, how's and of soldiers to die as a matter of fact in many cases, Russians are suffering huge losses but he's setting asked surgeries coming from the Far east of Russia and these are not soldiers from Moscow and they're not reserve a sour conscripts from some Petersburg from big cities and where they're influential athletes where that could be Arab alley another part of the society where the world will be able to mothers of fallen soldiers, protesting taking soldiers from and you are away areas of Russia, not Russians they're coming from a different nations. Nations who leave in Russian and those soldiers and are being killed and mosque simply they're actually outnumbering Ukrainians with the sheer number this is the difference between 40 million for aliens and whenever you're ready really interesting we or late on this. >> And it may it makes it harder in America. For us to support the war were late on getting the stuff they need yet the numbers are high in terms of what we already given have you express said the president Biden that you know they need F fifteens they need more tanks, 31 is not enough for the job tonight though. >> Yesterday I said to President Biden was because we had an opportunity to see each other during a reception. Given here in New York by this president on the occasion of the UN General Assembly actual traditionally I said I asked for a match to provide further support to Ukraine to instagram because that is of key importance to stop Russian imperialism to provide a huge war because I'm convinced that if Russian imperialism is not Then Russia, sooner or later with its actions will lead to a great war and then unfortunately as we have seen in history and the history, the First World War the Second World War in order to bring about peace in Europe somehow the United States again we'll have to get involved by deploying its soldiers that is why original making a pill to help Ukraine right now of Iran is able to defend itself before this conflicts pills over a motion today just wait can be kept off Russian imperialism simply by forcing Russians to withdraw and by doing that by punishing the imperialist ambitions. view share the move by the new book which Vladimir putin is demonstrating. This is a huge opportunity today to keep the peace in the world and I appeal to everyone but you and I just I also asked president Biden I do the same stuff because it to use this opportunity just to this opportunity is being used recess. We grew supporting Ukraine we're starting an instagram to help Ukraine and to defend their homeland. So. >> You I understand spending even more. On your defense. In any other nation in NATO pretty per capita for EU GDP, not only you do in 2% you're going to get up to 4%. Why do the polls people a new president due in particular understand the need to hit the threshold of 2 and double it where other nations like Germany, France, hungry and others don't even get close to that in fact only 9 nations are hitting their 2% that drives that drives. Critics of NATO crazy play people like president Trump and he's got a great point doesn't he. Yeah I'm sure the master that I was 17 years old in 1989. >> When I was like what the Iron curtain postcard was falling and when Poland was liberating itself from the darkness off communism. And the postal most simply the Soviets from the Russian from the Soviet sphere of influence he said we were successful, thanks to celebrity. Thanks to the determination. Of the Polish and also thanks to huge support from the United States and will always be grateful to add to President Ronald Reagan will recall him with a break and with great class but also our question of the Pope John Paul the second were so I've got a picture and where is run as a Reagan and the pope were talking to each other the way to a huge leaders world leaders and to get away from minister Margaret Thatcher they brought up and the fall of the air and hurting his and thanks to that we managed to liberate every sound of without light without block check in a Democratic way through protests 3 elections. That was a great great success, but we understand not too well in Poland with Russian occupation is what Russian sphere of influence stands for and today when Russia began but the idea has revived his interrogations that wants to govern just have to get its of other nations which it demonstrated in Georgia back in 2008 which has been demonstrating since 2014 Ukraine and since last year to see through full-scale operation by crashing still in neighborhoods by killing called Joseph Polish people understand full well that we have to prepare ourselves right to show that we are strong enough and hands the now some of you to spend on defense on strengthening collision forces of course we're very happy to have on our soil that us soldiers come and we are really grateful for that to the United States as a state and as a member of NATO, him know that what is of the biggest importance is to make sure that we are at risk possible. A thunder is possible as the one who cares for their own security prison due to a polling have so many questions for you, but I guess first and foremost. >> Is this a putin issue is Vladimir putin the one who really wants to expand get the Russian empire back was this a Russian government policy and he just happens to be the president is putin the problem or is Russia. The problem. To beaches a grease gun on the problem in the U.S. to a huge problem is the seas to 2 of the president of the Russian Federation Vladimir putin he is leading the state and these are his political decisions of of course a circle Hayes collaborators as well let's be open and Frank and say the following this policy the imperialist Russian the policy of aggression of Russia against the grain and maids support of a huge part of that Russian society there are no big protests in Russia games to let her put in its policy on year. >> Is sessions and your many years have been bad with drug and ashes of their being convinced that they have the right to the average other nations that they have the right to exist and there are a little skinny it back to the nation's in our part of the world in our part of the rallies that he has and he's got it has to do with a Russian aggression with the Russians lenses and they don't want to have them back and we will defend ourselves against that because would not want to have a scheme year. We have our own couch church. We have our own Caston was and we want to preserve these would not want Russia to impose its rules upon asked like they've done before with the Soviet Union coming on one and not see German and the other end and they cut Poland to pieces in you're not going to let that happen again, I'm sure of it because I'm one of the van of those a little bit about the huge number of our citizens were murdered tadpoles were shut down during the Second World War that was done by Germans by German Nazis that was also Don by Russians in cutting they killed police officers post-intelligencer dash should says several 1000 polls were murdered in a brutal way right by the Stalin regime by the Soviets set the conditions of hundreds of thousands were to depart it to your way Siberia when know what severing means a Russian Slade meant and we never want to say that the greater this capturing things like that taking Ukrainian kids and bring them into Russia. They give 4% of their GDP to NATO and they've already 3.1 Excuse me. >> 3.2 6 billion dollars. Towards fight in Ukraine and taking over >> Breaking news unique opinions. Steer it all on the Brian kilmeade show. >> This said President president do we're privileged to have the president polling Tuesday in such a remarkable job as an ally to the Americans, especially to the Ukrainians understand the Russian threat. Mister president. Give me your view on the counterinsurgency right now I know you said prior to this the Russians have really dug in and they're looking to protect the land. They stole. And but it seems as though there seems to be breakthroughs over the last few weeks and taking back small towns are they getting the the money equipment are they starting to see some penetration. But on take the offensive beginning of defense is to come to France or the candor of unsafe launched by a crane was very difficult was it to Mister the reason for that was that and what perhaps they Brennan's might not have or might have underestimated that Russians their preparations to keep the occupied areas. >> Russians built very strong line of defense they build fortifications and first and foremost they laid hundreds of square kilometers off minefields Asia and indeed they green army which was launching the country fence it was entering those mine fields and suffered huge losses that is why a couple of months ago. I personally was asked by President volodymyr Zelensky Jessica at no time was he pushed up says while on that Poland and was special vehicles and the mining vehicles position of the sun and sports as a matter of fact we were supplying such vehicles from Cohen as part of our support we're looking at every over Poland and military and it's another to be able to deploy them to a grandson as possible, so they could support that offensive activities it rains it's a part of the country and that fact, Russians who was on a date for a lot of work to be filed and that was holding back the largest ash raining in that country fans of today, he's no and some of those average by fields have been neutralized that that is going to be a concern for 10's of years after the war and because we know that's my feels are tragedies that you feel you not only has time to kind of minds to carry that today show you get that today a lot of those difficulties have been over 90 seconds left. Right now people wonder how committed Western Europe is to this. >> There's word that India is selling Russian oil back to Western Europe to get a discount. They're starting to break their own sanctions countries like Germany. You worry about countries like Germany and France who are not giving what they pledged. You think they'll start to maybe forget about this. Job so this is can move well in the first I keep calling on the assistance to Ukraine is also very consistent implementation of the sanctions policy vis-a-vis Russia, Russia has to stop to the Russian imperialism is very dangerous. >> Today this Russian he really saying is demonstrated through that brutal aggression against a greatness that is Russia is successful in Ukraine and it will probably attack and other states locked in as many years ago in 2008 when Russia invaded Georgia and polish president Lech Kaczynski. It was saying in Tbilisi I had an honor to cooperate with him back then as a young minister in his She said that you today, it's Georgia tomorrow, perhaps it will be a great and then the both say that perhaps even my country Poland predict that he said it in 2008 and unfortunately, he's words are coming true that is why we started our drank so much to support Ukraine today in our part of Europe, vice president of the Baltic states myself because we are aware that I that's and rash. It poses a real threat to that there is a Russian pair of this president\",\n",

       " 'The man known to history as Hans Frank was\\nborn on the 23rd of May 1900 in the town of Karlsruhe near the River Rhine in western\\nGermany. His father was Karl Frank, who was a lawyer\\nand a Protestant and his mother Magdalena was conversely a Roman Catholic. She was the daughter of a prosperous banker\\nand the marriage was one between two upper-middle class professional families. Magdalena and Karl eventually had three children\\nof whom Hans was the second. He also had an elder brother called Karl Jr.\\nand a younger sister named Elisabeth. When Hans was just an infant the family relocated\\nfrom the province of Baden-Wurttemberg in which Karlsruhe was located, to the Bavaria\\nregion of southern Germany. Where they lived in the provincial capital\\nof Munich. It was a move that would have considerable\\nsignificance for Frank’s life as he became intimately associated with the extremist politics\\nof Munich in his early adult years. In his youth he attended the Maximilian Gymnasium\\nin Munich, a German grammar school. However, his home life was troubled. Hans’s father Karl, despite the veneer of\\nprofessional success which he displayed, was something of a misfit and he soon developed\\na poor reputation for his abilities as a lawyer in Munich, as well as corrupt activity. Eventually, many years later, he was even\\nstruck off the legal register in Bavaria after being found guilty of embezzlement. To compound matters he was a serial womaniser\\nand eventually Magdalena Frank left her husband and entered a relationship with a German professor\\nwho lived in Prague. Consequently, Hans spent much of his teenage\\nyears being shuttled back and forth between Munich and Prague. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given this peculiar\\nbackground for the 1910s, Hans grew into an insecure young man. Frank grew up at a time when Europe was already\\nin a state of tension, unrest which would soon boil over into war and shape the continent’s\\nhistory for decades to come. For centuries Germany had not been a single\\nstate, but rather a collection of hundreds of small states, some large, some very small. A gradual process of absorption of the smaller\\nstates into the large ones was completed in 1871 when a new unified German Empire was\\nformed. This massively destabilised the balance of\\npower in Europe, creating a new state in the centre of the continent which was stronger\\nthan any of its neighbours. Thus, in the decades that followed Europe’s\\npowers began organising themselves into two armed alliances, one centring on Germany and\\nAustria-Hungary, and the other consisting of Britain, France and Russia. Other forces such as colonial rivalry and\\nregional nationalism combined to ensure that a regional crisis that occurred in the Balkans\\nin the summer of 1914 ballooned into a continent-wide conflict, which soon became the First World\\nWar. In this Germany had much the better of the\\nfighting, but its resource base eventually proved insufficient once the United States\\nentered the war on Britain and France’s side. Thus, in November 1918 Germany surrendered. Political chaos would follow for several years\\nas a new German Republic was established. These events would eventually impact on the\\nentire trajectory of Frank’s life. Hans was drafted for military service in June\\n1918 when he finished at the Gymnasium in Munich and when he was just after turning\\neighteen years of age. He was perhaps eager to fight, as his brother\\nKarl, who was eight years his senior, had been killed in the war, but Hans never saw\\naction himself before the war came to a conclusion the following November. As a result Frank moved on quickly to begin\\nstudying law in Munich, a city which was riven by political debates and divisions in the\\naftermath of the war. The country as a whole was divided in the\\nearly days of its new republic between right-wing conservatives who pined for the empire which\\nGermany had now lost and those who wished to see a socialist or even a communist state\\nto be developed. An insurrection even occurred in Berlin in\\nJanuary 1919 amongst revolutionaries who wanted to attempt something similar to the communist\\nrevolution which had been attempted with great success in Russia in 1917. As these twin forces emerged in the aftermath\\nof the war the nascent German republic became an extremely turbulent place politically. In the late 1910s and early 1920s much of\\nthis focused on hundreds of thousands of German men who had been demobilised in the aftermath\\nof the war. The Versailles Treaty, which brought the war\\nbetween Germany and Britain, France and their allies to a conclusion in 1919 stipulated\\nthat the German army could only consist of a maximum of 100,000 men going forward. As a result many, many Germans began entering\\nparamilitary groups in 1919 and 1920 which were being used by the German government to\\ntry to suppress political unrest by the socialists and other groups. Frank soon joined the most significant of\\nthese groups, the Freikorps, or Free Corps, which in the course of the spring and early\\nsummer of 1919 was responsible for crushing a short-lived communist republic based out\\nof Munich. Frank also joined the German Worker’s Party,\\na new party which had emerged with the goal of re-strengthening Germany’s military power\\nin the aftermath of the war around this time. Finally, in 1919 he became a member of the\\nThule-Gesellschaft, an Anti-Semitic, right-wing extremist group which attempted to blame Germany’s\\nrecent woes on the country’s Jewish population. It was an ominous sign of the Anti-Semitism\\nwhich Frank would display in later years. Meanwhile, his legal studies continued in\\nways that would also influence the subsequent course of his life. Out of this chaotic, radical politics of the\\nlate 1910s and early 1920s a new party emerged in Bavaria in the spring of 1920. The National Socialist German Workers’ Party,\\nor Nazi Party for short, was a right-wing group whose earliest members generally came\\nfrom the earlier German Workers’ Party and the Freikorps, of both of which Frank had\\nbeen a member. Despite this he did not join the Nazis immediately,\\nthough he did attend many speeches given by Adolf Hitler, a prominent member of the party\\nwho became its leader in 1921, and Frank also began representing the Nazis in the many law\\nsuits they quickly faced owing to their extremist and often violent activity in Munich and Bavaria. This earned him no little criticism within\\nlegal circles and on at least one occasion in the early 1920s Frank was reprimanded by\\na fellow lawyer in a Munich courtroom for continuing to act as legal counsel for a party\\nthat was seen as dangerous to the social order. Despite this he became embedded in the Nazis,\\neventually joining them and their paramilitary wing, the Stormtroopers or SA for short in\\nOctober 1923. Consequently, just weeks later, he was involved\\nin an abortive coup which the Nazis attempted in Munich on the 8th of November 1923 when\\nthey took over the Beer Hall in central Munich. It was quickly suppressed within 24 hours. Following the abortive coup Frank spent some\\ntime in Austria laying low and continuing his studies in Vienna before returning to\\nGermany in 1924. There he finished his legal studies at the\\nUniversity of Kiel later that year and sat the state examinations in 1926. It was right around this time that the Nazis\\nbegan rejuvenating their party. Hitler was released from prison early in December\\n1924 and in the spring of 1925 he convinced the Bavarian authorities to lift a ban on\\nthe party which had been imposed following the Putsch. As it did a new strategy was adopted to begin\\ntrying to acquire power throughout Germany through the electoral process, rather than\\nby the violent measures used in 1923. Yet the Nazis continued to engage in certain\\naggressive behaviour and the SA remained as a paramilitary wing of the organisation. As a result there were continuing legal challenges\\nconstantly facing Hitler and many other members of the party. Frank began representing senior party members\\nin many of these cases, such that by 1927 he was effectively Hitler’s personal lawyer. He would represent him approximately 150 times\\nin court and by the late 1920s he was firmly established as the leading legal representative\\nfor all of those who formed the leadership of the party during these early days of its\\nelectoral progress. Frank was becoming established as the most\\nsenior lawyer representing the Nazi Party at a time when the Nazis were set to become\\nthe leading power in German politics. After years of excellent economic growth in\\nEurope and the Americas during the 1920s the world economy came to a shuddering halt in\\nthe autumn of 1929 as the stock market on Wall Street in New York City experienced major\\nlosses. An economic recession ensued and that was\\nquickly followed by the Great Depression, as economies all over the world stagnated. Some countries which had underlying debts,\\nweak banks and other economic problems were particularly badly hit. Germany was amongst these. As a result in the course of the early 1930s\\nmillions of Germans began to lose their jobs as businesses and the service sector which\\nsupplied them closed their doors. Then huge inflation kicked in, leading most\\npeople to lose their life savings. And as anger and resentment about all of this\\ngrew the more extremist political parties gained increasing support. The Nazis were chief amongst them. Although they had previously been able to\\ngarner little more than 2% of the vote in an average national election, in the Reichstag\\nelections of September 1930 they won 18% and became the second largest party in Germany. Thus, Frank was now the legal representative\\nfor a party which might plausibly enter government in the not too distant future. In 1930 Frank was called upon by Hitler to\\ninvestigate a particularly delicate matter. Rumours had begun to circulate amongst some\\nof the party’s leaders enemies that he was of partly Jewish descent. This was a toxic accusation for the leader\\nof a party which was in no small way based around blaming the Jewish people for all of\\nthe woes of Germany’s recent past. In an effort to clear up the matter Hitler\\ntasked Frank with acquiring legally definitive proof that he was in no way possessed of Jewish\\nblood. Frank duly set about this and reported back\\nin Hitler’s favour, asserting that the rumours were without foundation. But curiously enough, many years later, Frank\\nclaimed that he had actually concluded at the time that there was a possibility that\\nHitler had some Jewish blood. The Nazi party leader’s grandmother, a woman\\ncalled Maria Anna Schicklgruber, had never married, but had given birth to a child out\\nof wedlock when she was 42 years of age. That child was Hitler’s father, Alois Hitler. The identity of Alois’s father had been\\nand still remains a mystery, but Frank claimed his investigations in the early 1930s could\\nnot rule out the possibility that Alois’s mother had fallen pregnant through a relationship\\nwith Leopold Frankenberger, a member of the Jewish Frankenberger family for whom she had\\nworked for a time as a cook. The Frankenberger family, Frank claimed, had\\nsubsequently paid for Alois’s upbringing. Frank’s claims have, though, been dismissed\\nby many historians who have found no record of a Leopold Frankenberger and have assumed\\nFrank was mistaken in his claims or deliberately concocted them. Nevertheless, it is curious to speculate what\\nFrank might have made of it as he represented the Nazi leader in ever more legal suits which\\nwere pending in the early 1930s as his personal lawyer. Though Hitler was facing ever growing amounts\\nof legal suits which Frank acted as his legal representative in during the early 1930s,\\nthe contrary reality to these legal issues was that the Nazi leader was closer than ever\\nto gaining power in Germany. Though elections were not held for almost\\ntwo years after those of September 1930 the party had continued to gain more and more\\nmembers and support as the German economy showed no signs of recovery and teetered on\\nthe brink of collapse. When new Reichstag elections were finally\\nheld in the summer of 1932 the party doubled its vote to 37% and claimed 230 seats in the\\n608 seat parliament. Still the centrist parties refused to countenance\\nHitler being made German chancellor and a government of technocrats was cobbled together. However, when it could not relieve the crisis\\nand fresh elections in November failed to break the political impasse, an agreement\\nwas finally reached in January 1933 whereby Hitler would become German Chancellor and\\nthe Nazis would acquire several ministerial briefs. It was a fateful decision. Within weeks a political emergency was concocted\\nin order to pass through an Enabling Act in March 1933 which allowed Hitler and the Nazis\\nto effectively rule by decree. The Weimar Republic was dead and the Nazis\\nwere now in control of Germany. With the ascent to power of Hitler Frank found\\nhimself being rewarded for his loyalty. Back in 1928 he had established the National\\nSocialist German Jurists Association, with himself as its first leader, and in 1930 he\\nhad won a seat in the Reichstag representing Leignitz. Thus, when positions were being handed out\\nin the spring of 1933 Frank was an obvious candidate to be given the position of Minister\\nof Justice for Bavaria, the Nazi heartland within Germany, while he was also appointed\\nas a Minister without Portfolio in the new government. Finally, in the summer of 1933 he was made\\na Reichsleiter or Reich Leader. This was the second highest rank within the\\nregime, next to Hitler himself. There were 16 Reichsleiters appointed in 1933\\nand Frank was now afforded this status along with individuals such as the head of the SS,\\nHeinrich Himmler, the Minister for Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, Hitler’s deputy leader,\\nRudolf Hess, and Ernst Rohm, the head of the SA or Stormtroopers. In the months that followed he also established\\nthe Academy for German Law and became its first president and was named one of the three\\nsenior judges of the Supreme Party Court. Thus, by early 1934 Frank had emerged as the\\nmost significant legal figure within the Nazi regime. While Frank was acting as the face of legal\\ninstitutions such as the Academy for German Law and the Supreme Party Court in the mid-1930s\\nthe Nazis themselves were transgressing their own international legal commitments. The terms of the Treaty of Versailles still\\nrestricted German’s right in law to rearm beyond the nominal army of 100,000 men which\\nthey were allowed to retain following the end of the First World War. The Weimar government had itself pushed these\\nlimits as far as possible, training tens of thousands more individuals than were officially\\nrecorded, but the Nazis went much further. Beginning in the spring of 1935 the regime\\nmade known its intention to begin vastly exceeding the 100,000 man quota by recruiting and training\\nupwards of 400,000 men. At the same time it was announced that a new\\nGerman air-force called the Luftwaffe would be set up, a violation of the restriction\\nwhich prohibited Germany from having any such air-force. Then a year later in the spring of 1936 German\\nforces moved into the Rhineland region of western Germany which had been demilitarised\\nas part of the terms of Versailles. All of this was ominous, but Germany’s remilitarisation\\nwould soon be eclipsed as it began making claims on the territories of its neighbours\\nin Central Europe. His newfound position of power would not last\\nlong. Frank did actually have scruples early on\\nwhen it came to the Nazis ignoring legal norms. Thus, in 1934 he began complaining about extra-judicial\\nkillings of political prisoners and others, which were being carried out at the Dachau\\nconcentration camp near Munich. The region fell within his area of oversight\\nas Minister of Justice for Bavaria. More significantly, Frank was opposed to the\\nseries of purges of the leadership of the SA which were carried out between the 30th\\nof June and the 2nd of July 1934. These were designed to curb the growing power\\nof the SA’s commander, Ernst Rohm, who was viewed as a growing threat to Hitler as the\\nSA’s numbers surpassed two million Stormtroopers. The Night of the Long Knives saw Rohm and\\nmany other political enemies across Germany murdered by the Nazi regime. Frank had made his opposition known and this,\\ncombined with Hitler’s natural antipathy towards the legal profession, saw Frank side-lined. In December 1934 he resigned his position\\nas Minister of Justice for Bavaria and, while he retained some of his other positions, including\\nthat of Reichsleiter and Minister without Portfolio, his influence over the regime dried\\nup from late 1934 onwards. Frank would spend the next several years in\\na political wilderness. Frank’s fortunes improved little as the\\nmonths and then years passed by in the mid-to-late 1930s, even as his legal writings became more\\nand more concerned with fashioning the law around Nazi ideology and in particular its’\\nAnti-Semitism. War would change that. Beginning in early 1938 the regime took a\\nmore confrontational stance towards the powers of Europe. In March of that year an aggressive move against\\nAustria succeeded in having the country vote to amalgamate with Berlin into a Greater Germany. No sooner was this completed, but Hitler began\\npressing German claims to the German-speaking parts of western Czechoslovakia known as the\\nSudetenland. Britain and France capitulated to this demand\\nat a conference in Munich in September 1938, but this only briefly allayed German aggression\\nand the rest of Czechoslovakia was effectively forcibly annexed in March 1939. The city of Memel was taken from Lithuania\\njust days later. This was the last act of aggression Britain\\nand France were willing to countenance, so when Hitler very quickly began pressing claims\\non Poland the allies made it clear that any further land grab would result in war. The Nazis were not dissuaded and on the 1st\\nof September invaded Poland. Two days later Britain and France followed\\nthrough on their threat and declared war on Germany in the first acts of what would soon\\nbe transformed into the Second World War. Frank would become intimately connected with\\nPoland for the remainder of his life, in ways that have made him one of the most notorious\\nmembers of the Nazi regime. Having become used to being in the political\\nwilderness since the mid-1930s, he was surprisingly selected at the beginning of the invasion\\nof Poland to act as the Chief of Administration to Gerd von Rundstedt, one of the most senior\\nfield marshals of the German army in Poland. The Polish campaign went very quickly, as\\nGermany’s eastern neighbour was unable to stand up to the onslaught of the Nazi forces\\nand given the geography involved Britain and France could offer very little by way of practical\\naid. As a result the country had been defeated\\nmilitarily within weeks. And this was the moment at which the even\\nmore surprising decision was taken to appoint Frank as the first Governor of what was christened\\nas the General Government of Poland, a region comprising about one-third of the Polish Republic. The choice was peculiar. Frank was not a military man who had some\\nobvious qualification to serve as governor of an occupied region. Neither had he ever shown any special interest\\nin Polish affairs in a way which would suggest him as a man to administer the occupied country. Indeed he did not even speak or understand\\nPolish. By any standard it was an unusual decision. The country or administrative region which\\nFrank was to oversee did not comprise the entire territory of what had been until recently\\nthe Second Polish Republic. Rather Poland was split into three separate\\nparts by an agreement known as the Annexation Decree on the Administration of the Occupied\\nPolish Territories, which was issued by Hitler on the 8th of October 1939. The western part of Poland was annexed directly\\ninto the German Third Reich. The eastern sector of Poland was then annexed\\ndirectly by the Soviet Union. This was in keeping with an agreement the\\nNazis had reached with the Soviet Union just days before the invasion of Poland. Through the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact Germany\\nand Russia had agreed to divide up Eastern Europe between them. Russia would receive a third of Poland under\\nthese terms and had invaded this section of the country shortly after Germany’s initial\\ninvasion. That left approximately one-third of the country\\nwhich was not directly annexed into either the German Third Reich or the Soviet Union. It was this region in central and southern\\nPoland, and extending into what is now western Ukraine, which would be formed into the General\\nGovernment for the Occupied Polish Region and which Frank was made Governor General\\nof in October 1939. He would serve in that position for the duration\\nof the Second World War. The area ruled by the General Government had\\na population of approximately 11.4 million people when it was established in the late\\nautumn of 1939. It also included Poland’s most significant\\ncities, notably Warsaw, Krakow and Lublin, as well as Lviv in what is now western Ukraine. Frank was the most senior figure within the\\nadministration as Governor General, but there were others with whom he had to contend and\\nwho would play a significant role in future events. A State Secretary was appointed as a sort\\nof Deputy Governor. Initially Arthur Seyss-Inquart was appointed\\nto this role but he was moved westwards to Amsterdam following the Nazi invasion of Western\\nEurope in the summer of 1940. Thus, Josef Buhler was made State Secretary\\nin 1940 and would hold the position for the remainder of the war. Buhler was an old ally of Frank’s who had\\nworked in his office in Berlin prior to the war. However, Frank had no ally in the other senior\\nfigure within the administration. This was Friedrich-Wilhelm Kruger, the Higher\\nSS and Police Leader of the General Government. As head of the state police services in the\\nGeneral Government Kruger was able to claim seniority over Frank in several spheres of\\nactivity and the pair would clash on many issues during the early 1940s. We might also ask what the purpose of the\\nGeneral Government was. Why had Hitler chosen to directly annex part\\nof Poland into the Third Reich, but establish an occupied territory out of another section\\nof it? The answer, as with so much else to do with\\nthe Nazis, had a racial basis to it. As the parts of western and north-western\\nPoland that were annexed into the Reich had a significant ethnically German population\\nand had formed parts of Prussia from the late eighteenth century these were viewed as racially\\npure. However, the area of the General Government\\nwas populated overwhelmingly by Poles, with a Ukrainian majority in the far east of the\\nadministrative zone. As such the plan for the region was to impose\\na radical and brutal policy of Germanisation. Many Poles, and in particular Polish Jews,\\nof which there were over 1.5 million within the General Government’s borders, would\\nbe mass murdered or deported to create Lebensraum or ‘Living Space’ for German colonists. Over a period of 10 to 15 years 4 to 5 million\\nGerman colonists would then be brought into the region. Those Poles and Ukrainians who remained would\\nbe expected to work as a new serf class for the new colonial Germans who would be their\\noverlords. This was the warped experiment in social engineering\\nthat Frank was charged with implementing the first stages of as Governor General. Because of this peculiar situation, whereby\\nthe General Government was to be treated as a military colony in preparation, the region\\nFrank administered remained heavily militarised throughout his tenure as governor. In the first months of the occupation, as\\nFrank’s regime carried out a ruthless suppression of the Polish political and intellectual class,\\nhalf a million German soldiers remained stationed in the region. This number dropped slightly in 1940 as Germany’s\\nwar effort shifted elsewhere, but in general there was always a standing garrison of approximately\\n400,000 German military personnel in the General Government, with an average of about 70,000\\npolice and security services personnel also operating here. To put this in perspective, this amounted\\nto approximately one German military personnel for every 20 Polish citizens. Moreover, this number ratio actually grew\\nsmaller still as the number of people killed or deported by the Nazis spiralled into the\\nmillions in the course of the war. Thus, the General Government under Frank might\\nbest be described as a kind of giant open-air prison where over eleven million Poles were\\nguarded by over a half a million Germans. Frank’s approach to the people he was appointed\\nto govern was brutal. Shortly before he took up his position he\\ndeclared that after the occupation of Poland, (to quote), “only one thing counts: the\\nuse of the land by ruthless exploitation, taking away all stocks important to the German\\nwar economy, demanding manpower for the benefit of employment in the Reich, reducing the entire\\nPolish economy to a level where only the barest essentials remain for the poorest and the\\nclosing down of all educational institutions, in particular the technical and high schools\\nin order to prevent the rise of a new generation of Polish intellectuals.” This was reflected in his attitudes towards\\ngroups such as the Roman Catholic Church, a powerful institution within Poland. Frank ensured that the church could not become\\na focus for resistance to the occupation and closed down churches systematically. Hundreds of priests were murdered every year\\nduring the early 1940s and approximately 3,000 clergy were killed in all during his time\\nas governor. More broadly he viewed anything that might\\nallow an independent Polish culture to flourish as dangerous and Poles under the occupation\\nwere not allowed radio sets or even to attend cinemas and theatres in case Polish cultural\\nshows were staged. Frank established himself in the capital of\\nthe General Government, Krakow, with almost regal pretensions. In early November 1939 he moved into the historic\\nWawel royal palace there with his family. Back in April 1925 Hans had married Brigitte\\nHerbst after a brief courtship. Eventually they had five children, Sigrid,\\nNorman, Brigitte, Michael and Niklas. Once ensconced in the palace in Krakow, Brigitte\\nFrank, a domineering woman who engaged in multiple extra-marital affairs, began referring\\nto herself as the Queen of Poland and became notorious for her corrupt behaviour, often\\ntravelling around the city to various locations and events to abscond with furs, jewels and\\nmoney from the homes of formerly wealthy Poles. Eventually her behaviour began to draw attention\\nto what was perceived to be an overt level of corruption associated with Frank. Hans also eventually grew tired of his wife’s\\nactions and after reconnecting with a childhood sweetheart, Lilly Groh, in 1942 he sought\\na divorce, one which was refused when Brigitte headed to Berlin and personally sought an\\naudience with Hitler where she successfully petitioned him to block what could have been\\nan embarrassing separation for the regime. Frank never had total control over the General\\nGovernment. As the region was viewed as a zone of military\\nactivity, the SS and the Reich Security Main Office, headed respectively by Heinrich Himmler\\nand Reinhard Heydrich, as well as the secret police, the Gestapo, under Heinrich Muller,\\nall had significant jurisdictional oversight over a great many affairs in Poland. Indeed any assessment of Frank’s responsibility\\nfor the level of violence and death which characterised the region during the Second\\nWorld War must take account of the fact that often he was not the person responsible for\\neither deciding upon this or even overseeing it. The SS, in particular, were a power unto themselves\\nwithin the General Government and entirely outside of Frank’s sphere of control. Indeed the governor and Himmler had multiple\\narguments in the early 1940s about the excessive authority the SS and police services held\\nand their lack of respect for any form of rule of law or normal judicial procedure. Eventually these tensions boiled over in 1942\\nin a direct clash between Frank and the effective head of the SS in the General Government,\\nFriedrich Wilhem Kruger, after Frank complained about Kruger simply ignoring him and acting\\nas though the SS did not have to make any effort to include Frank’s administration\\nin his decisions and actions. The outcome, when it was reported back to\\nBerlin, showed exactly how limited Frank’s authority was. Hitler sided with the SS and while Frank was\\nretained as the governor of the General Government he was stripped of the vast majority of his\\nother positions back in Germany. Somebody in Frank’s position as head of\\nthe Nazi government in Poland must have gone through fluctuating emotions over the course\\nof the first years of the Second World War. After the swift conquest of Poland, Hitler\\nhad waited until the spring of 1940 before launching a rapid conquest of Denmark and\\nNorway. Weeks later Germany invaded the Low Countries\\nand France and conquered Western Europe in a blistering campaign which lasted just six\\nweeks. However, Britain remained independent despite\\na concerted campaign to bomb it into submission from the summer of 1940 onwards. A year later Frank was in charge of Poland\\nas a huge troop build-up was undertaken in the region as Germany prepared to invade the\\nSoviet Union. At first Operation Barbarossa, the codename\\nfor the initial invasion of Russia, went well and by the late autumn of 1941 the Germans\\nwere threatening to take Moscow and Leningrad. The leader of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin,\\neven considered surrendering vast stretches of territory to Germany as part of a peace\\nagreement. But that winter things changed. The German advance stalled and thousands of\\ntroops died in the harsh Russian winter. Perhaps as events became more precarious Frank\\nmust have wondered if the General Government would one day see Russian troops advancing\\ntowards Berlin. The Nazis’ approach towards the Jewish people\\nhad been intensifying for years. Though Hitler and his followers had always\\nexhibited a vicious Anti-Semitism, after their ascent to power in 1933 they had generally\\nfavoured a strategy of trying to pressure Germany’s half a million Jews into leaving\\nthe country by persecuting them through a series of measures known as the Nuremburg\\nLaws. As we have seen, Frank was in favour of moulding\\nGerman law in this way to fit the party’s racial ideology. This was already escalating by late 1938 when\\nthousands of Jewish businesses were attacked in the events of Kristallnacht, the Night\\nof the Broken Glass on the 9th and 10th of November, the occasion of the murder of hundreds\\nof Jews and detention of thousands more. With the onset of the war the situation changed\\nyet again. Poland was home to approximately three and\\na half million Jews when Germany invaded in 1939. This was a mass of people which it was not\\npossible to simply coerce into leaving and plans for the forcible deportation of the\\nJews of Eastern Europe to either the Middle East or the East African island of Madagascar\\nwere given serious consideration for some time while Frank was governing this mass of\\npeople in southern and eastern Poland. However, in the course of 1940 and early 1941,\\nas the war effort seemed to be going well for the Nazis, a more sinister scheme began\\nto be developed. There is still disagreement today as to when\\nexactly the so-called Final Solution to what the Nazis called “the Jewish problem”\\nwas actually decided upon, but it was evidently sometime in the late spring or early summer\\nas the plans for the invasion of Russia were being finalised. At that time measures were put in place to\\nhave the Einsatzgruppen, which had already been involved in the mass murder of the Polish\\npolitical and cultural classes in 1939 and 1940, advance behind the Germany army into\\nthe Soviet Union, mass murdering Jewish communities as they went. At the same time the first steps were undertaken\\ntowards developing extermination centres at some of the dozens of concentration camps\\nwhich the Nazis had erected across Central and Eastern Europe. It was now planned that the Jews of those\\nparts of Europe already under Nazi occupation, of which roughly half were in the territory\\ngoverned by Frank as part of the General Government, would be identified, detained and shipped\\nto these specific camps where they would be murdered en masse. This new plan was related to over a dozen\\nsenior Nazi officials at a conference in the Berlin suburb of Wannsee on the 20th of January\\n1942 including Josef Buhler, the State Secretary of the General Government and Frank’s right-hand\\nman. It was the beginning of the Holocaust of Europe’s\\nJews. Under Frank’s governorship the region administered\\nby the General Government became the central focus of the Holocaust of Europe’s Jews. While there were dozens of concentration camps\\nthat had been established by the Nazis across Europe, and some level of death and brutality\\nexisted in all of these, the Holocaust was truly carried out at six major death camps\\nor extermination camps which were constructed in such a way as to facilitate this with facilities\\nfor mass murder and crematoria to burn the bodies afterwards. Of these death camps, four, Treblinka, Majdanek,\\nSobibor and Belzec, were within the territory of the General Government, while Auschwitz-Birkenau\\nwas just over the border in the part of Poland which had been directly annexed into the Third\\nReich. Only Chelmno in western Poland was at any\\nsignificant remove from the General Government. The level of murder at these camps was appalling. 800,000 people, most of them Jews, were killed\\nat Treblinka and 600,000 at Belzec, with 250,000 and at least 80,000 also perishing at Sobibor\\nand Majdanek. When the over one million people who were\\nkilled at Auschwitz-Birkenau are considered over three million people died at the five\\ncamps in or adjoining the territory of the General Government in Poland. These camps were run by the SS independent\\nof Frank’s administration in Krakow. But that does not mean that the civil government\\nthere was not involved. Much of what Frank’s administration was\\neffectively charged with doing throughout these years was facilitating the identification\\nof Jews and other people deemed enemies of the state, detaining them and then facilitating\\ntheir transport to the death camps where most were killed within the space of hours of their\\narrival by being gassed to death. Indeed Frank’s regime had been deliberately\\nengaging in policies which were aimed at murdering the Jewish people living within the boundaries\\nof the General Government even before the Final Solution was adopted and began to be\\nimplemented. Thus, for instance, there was a conscious\\neffort to deprive Jewish people in particular of vital resources in the region Frank administered,\\nnotably food, but also core necessities such as coal. The idea here was to potentially either starve\\nthousands of Jews to death or have them freeze to death. This was mass murder by resource starvation,\\nall overseen by Frank’s administration at the Wawel palace in Krakow. The epicentre of these combined efforts at\\npersecuting the General Government’s Jews and preparing for their transport to the death\\ncamps was the Warsaw Ghetto. Prior to the war the city of Warsaw had a\\nhuge Jewish population and some parts of the city were essentially Jewish enclaves, where\\nJewish people made up upwards of 80% to 90% of the population. This number had grown in the course of the\\nGerman invasion of 1939 as Jewish communities fled eastwards from the advancing German army\\nto Warsaw. Here Frank’s regime, along with the SS and\\nthe other security services quickly implemented a form of martial law as soon as Poland had\\nbeen fully occupied. Jews were forced to wear a white armband and\\nall Jewish businesses had to display a Star of David above their entrance. By early 1940 food stamps had been introduced\\nand resources coming into the city were severely curtailed. Then in April Frank’s administration began\\nbuilding a wall around the Jewish district which officially became a Ghetto in November\\n1940, wherein over 400,000 people were effectively detained inside an open air prison. By 1941 a systematic policy of starving the\\nJewish people here to death was initiated, as they were only allocated approximately\\n200 calories of food per day. By 1942 the Ghetto had turned into a quagmire\\nof diseases, starvation and death, although the Jewish inhabitants managed to maintain\\nsome form of normal life and culture, despite their hardships. Nearly 100,000 of the Jewish inhabitants died\\nunder these conditions. And then the deportations commenced, mostly\\nto Treblinka. Between the summer of 1942 and Yom Kippur\\nin late September that year over quarter of a million people were transported from the\\nGhetto to the death camps, though at this early stage in the implementation of the Final\\nSolution many people did not know where they were being taken to. Within weeks the signs were ominous, however,\\nand even as the numbers of people living within the Ghetto decline dramatically those who\\nremained began to organise themselves into a resistance movement known as the Jewish\\nCombat Organisation led by 24 year old Mordecai Anielewicz. Aided by the Polish resistance which smuggled\\nweapons into them, they prepared to resist further deportation efforts undertaken by\\nthe SS and Frank’s administration between late September 1942 and January 1943. Then, when the Germans re-entered the Ghetto\\nin January with the aim of liquidating it over the following few weeks they launched\\nan uprising. Despite being hemmed in and facing the might\\nof the Nazi war machine, approximately 1,000 Jewish resistance fighters managed to wage\\na guerrilla conflict against the Germans, mostly SS commandos, for three months before\\nthousands of Waffen-SS were sent in to crush the Ghetto Uprising on the eve of Passover,\\nthe 19th of April 1943. Following this the Ghetto was effectively\\nliquidated and the remaining 35,000 occupants who were not murdered on the spot were deported\\nto the death camps. With measures such as this was the Holocaust\\ncarried out in the General Government under Frank’s rule. The increasing brutality that was being seen\\nin parts of Nazi-occupied Europe such as Poland was in direct parallel with the shifting fortunes\\nof Germany on the battlefield. After the German advance had stopped at Leningrad\\nand Moscow in the winter of 1941 the Russians were able to use this time to build up their\\nwar production and conscript many more men. By 1942 they were pushing back against the\\nGermans and an ultimate showdown at the city of Stalingrad throughout the autumn and winter\\nthat year resulted in Russian victory. Thereafter the Soviets began to push the Germans\\nout of Russia and back towards Frank’s General Government in Poland. Meanwhile, in December 1941 the United States\\nhad entered the war on Britain and Russia’s side. With a flood of new men and war material the\\nAllies were able to gain victory over Italy and Germany in the North Africa campaign early\\nin 1943 and invaded Sicily to open a Southern Front that summer. A Western Front soon followed in the summer\\nof 1944 when France was invaded and quickly reconquered. Thus, by 1943 it must have been clear to leading\\nNazi officials such as Frank that barring the successful development of some game-changing\\nweapon such as a nuclear bomb, which the Germans were working on, the war would eventually\\nend in Germany’s defeat and the end of the Third Reich. As the war effort turned fatally against Germany,\\nthe level of unrest and resistance within Poland and the area of the General Government\\nincreased accordingly. There had always been a major resistance movement\\nwithin Poland, backed by a government in exile in London, but from 1943 onwards this was\\nincreasingly supplied by the Soviets as they advanced westwards into Ukraine and eastern\\nPoland. These resistance movements were united under\\nthe banner of the Polish Secret State, which began murdering hundreds of Germans in the\\nGeneral Government area. Then in late 1943 they began working on plans\\nto assassinate Frank, inspired in part by the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, the\\nacting governor of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia in modern-day Czechia in the early\\nsummer of 1942. They moved on the 29th of January 1944 when\\na bomb was placed on a train which Frank would be travelling on from Krakow to Lviv, the\\nmajor city in the Ukrainian part of the east of the General Government. The bomb detonated on the underside of the\\ntrain 22 kilometres outside of Krakow, at 11.17 pm and blew the last axle off of Frank’s\\ntrain carriage, but while the train derailed, he himself was uninjured. The following day he undertook the journey\\nby plane, flying at a low altitude in appalling weather. Polish prisoners were executed on Frank’s\\norders as a reprisal and security measures were increased across the General Government. The assassination attempt was just a prelude\\nto the outbreak of a much more severe form of resistance. In the spring of 1944 the Polish Secret State\\nbegan preparing for a massive uprising against German occupation as the Red Army advanced\\nfurther into Poland. The focus of it would symbolically be on the\\ncity of Warsaw and the goal was that German forces would be divided between fighting the\\nRussian advance to the east and the insurrection within the General Government in such a way\\nthat would allow for the success of the uprising and a speedier liberation of Poland from Nazi\\nrule. This was not mere impatience. In 1944 as the war entered its final stages\\nthe Nazi regime had become particularly vicious as it sought to murder as many of its racial,\\nideological and political enemies as possible before it lost control of individual regions. Over 400,000 of Hungary’s 750,000 Jewish\\npeople would be killed in the space of six months in 1944 alone, after the Nazis took\\ndirect control of the country. Thus, although it was later criticised as\\nbeing a premature insurrection, the Polish resistance launched its uprising in Warsaw\\non the 1st of August 1944. It would last for two months, however it would\\nultimately prove unsuccessful as both the Western Allies and the Red Army, the latter\\nof which was most suitably positioned to do so, failed to provide adequate support to\\nthe uprising. This was despite the views of the British\\nPrime Minister, Winston Churchill, that it was imperative to aid Britain’s Polish allies. While the Warsaw Uprising failed in the autumn\\nof 1944, the liberation of the General Government was not long following in any event. After some stiff resistance in the autumn\\nmonths, the German defence of Poland began to collapse in the winter as Hitler focused\\nGermany’s military efforts on one last major campaign against the Western Allies in the\\nArdennes region in Luxembourg and Belgium near the Franco-German border. As a result the General Government was broadly\\noverrun by the Red Army in December 1944 and January 1945. There was not much left of Warsaw to liberate,\\nas the city had been virtually levelled in the weeks following the Uprising. By mid-January Russian troops had surrounded\\nKrakow. Frank’s wife Brigitte and their children\\nhad already left for Germany in December and he now decided to abscond back to the Reich\\nhimself just before midday on the 17th of January. Air raid sirens had been ringing out in central\\nKrakow all that morning and Frank had received word that Russian tanks had penetrated the\\nouter defences of the city. Thus, he beat a hasty retreat from the capital\\nof the General Government which he had governed for over five years at lunchtime that day\\nin a column of cars with his senior administrators. Krakow fell just 24 hours later. Curiously Frank’s offices were full of documentation\\nand evidence of his administration’s activity which they had neglected to destroy. It was noted that the offices were strewn\\nwith empty liquor bottles, a not uncommon site in regions which the Nazis had fled from\\nin late 1944 and early 1945. Frank made his way back to Germany in the\\nweeks that followed, but his destination was not Berlin, but Bavaria, where he had spent\\nso much of his career in the 1920s and 1930s. He arrived there by early February and sent\\nword to Berlin that he was ready to continue serving the regime in whatever way was deemed\\nnecessary. However, Frank had been stripped of his positions\\nwithin Germany itself in 1942 and with the General Government now effectively dissolved\\nfollowing the Russian occupation of the region he effectively held no position or authority. On one occasion when he attempted to give\\norders to a junior officer, the man simply walked away while Frank was talking. Thus, the former governor spent the remaining\\nmonths of the war as a powerless former official. It was in this non-role that he learned in\\nthe first two days of May that Hitler had killed himself on the 30th of April in Berlin\\nas the Russians closed on the city centre. His appointed successor, the propaganda minister,\\nJoseph Goebbels, imitated his master on the 1st of May and thereafter German forces surrendered\\nin Berlin. The war officially came to an end on the 8th\\nof May, by which time Frank was under arrest. He had been detained in Bavaria on the 4th\\nof May. In the days that followed the man termed ‘The\\nJew Butcher of Krakow’ by some of his captors, was treated roughly, receiving more than one\\nbeating. The details are not entirely clear, but it\\nalso seems that he attempted to kill himself twice, once by trying to cut his throat and\\nthen by cutting his wrists. Eventually he was taken to a more secure military\\nprison near Berchtesgaden. In the weeks that followed Frank was identified\\nas one of the most wanted individuals within the Nazi regime, one who would stand trial\\nat the International Military Tribunal to be held at the city of Nuremburg. This involved nearly two dozen of the most\\nsenior surviving members of the regime and Frank stood trial here from November 1945\\nonwards alongside individuals such as Herman Goering, the head of the Luftwaffe and one\\nof the chief ministers of the Nazi regime; Albert Speer, colloquially known as Hitler’s\\narchitect and a figure who had ran the German armaments industry from 1942 onwards, overseeing\\nthe slave labour of the hundreds of thousands of Poles whom Frank had forcibly deported\\nto Germany to work in factories there; Joachim von Ribbentrop, the German Foreign Minister\\nwho had negotiated the pact with the Soviet Union in 1939 that had preceded the invasion\\nof Poland; and Alfred Rosenberg, the Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories with\\nwhom Frank had worked regularly during the war. Each was accused of crimes against peace,\\nplanning and initiating a war of aggression, participating in war crimes and crimes against\\nhumanity. The trial began on the 20th of November 1945\\nand would last for over ten months, with proceedings watched closely by the world. Frank’s conduct during the trial was different\\nto most of the other defendants. From early on in proceedings he expressed\\nremorse for his conduct. For instance, towards the early summer of\\n1946, roughly five months into trial proceedings, he stated that, “I myself, speaking from\\nthe very depths of my feelings and having lived through the five months of this trial,\\nwant to say that now after I have gained a full insight into all the horrible atrocities\\nwhich have been committed, I am possessed by a deep sense of guilt.” He also apparently experienced a religious\\nawakening and converted to Roman Catholicism under the guidance of Sixtus O’Connor, a\\nFranciscan pastor who had been appointed for the pastoral care of the Catholic defendants. He even claimed to have had several religious\\nexperiences during the lengthy trial. In addition Frank noted throughout the trial\\nthat he himself had not been responsible for the development of the death camps in the\\nGeneral Government and that most of the atrocities which had occurred there, resulting in millions\\nof deaths, had been carried out by the SS. Yet by way of contrast the prosecution was\\nable to present extensive evidence from the 43 volumes of Frank’s diaries which had\\nbeen acquired by the tribunal. These demonstrated time and time again Frank’s\\nsevere Anti-Semitism and his clear views that mass murder of Jews and Poles in the General\\nGovernment was something to be celebrated. The trial eventually drew to a conclusion\\nin late September 1946 and the verdicts were presented on the 1st of October. The other defendant who had expressed remorse,\\nAlbert Speer, was spared death and sentenced to life in prison, but Frank, despite his\\napparent contrition, had been the governor of the region where some of the Nazis’ most\\nheinous crimes had been committed. Accordingly, there was no way he would receive\\na lenient judgement and he was sentenced to death by hanging along with many of his fellow\\ndefendants such as Goering, Ribbentrop and Rosenberg. They were to be executed just over two weeks\\nlater in the Nuremburg Prison on the 16th of October 1946. It was noted on the day in question that Frank\\nwas the only one of those sentenced to death who entered the execution chamber with a smile\\non his face. Observers at the time claimed that, although\\nhe was evidently nervous too, Frank seemed to welcome the prospect of atoning for his\\nsins. When asked if he had any last words, Frank\\nreplied, “I am thankful for the kind treatment during my captivity and I ask God to accept\\nme with mercy.” Minutes later he was hung to death. His body and those of the ten other Nuremburg\\ndefendants who had been sentenced to death were cremated shortly thereafter and their\\nremains were scattered in the River Isar to avoid their remains becoming any kind of shrine\\nto the Nazi leadership. Though he is perhaps one of the less well-known\\nleaders of the Nazi regime today, Hans Frank was one of those most responsible for the\\ncrimes of the Nazis during the Second World War. As head of the General Government in Poland\\nhe oversaw a region where some of the most brutal actions perpetrated by the Nazis were\\ncommitted. For instance, four of the main death camps\\ninvolved in the Holocaust, Treblinka, Sobibor, Majdanek and Belzec, were located within Frank’s\\njurisdiction, while Auschwitz-Birkenau was just over the border in the part of Poland\\ndirectly annexed to the Third Reich. Moreover, it was in Poland in the early stages\\nof the war where brutal tactics such as those employed during Operation Tannenberg and the\\nuse of the Einsatzgruppen were first developed. In time these same tactics would be used further\\nto the east following the invasion of Russia, resulting in millions of deaths. In total, by the time Frank fled westwards\\nto Germany in January 1945, over four million of the eleven and a half million Poles and\\nUkrainians who had lived under the General Government when it was created late in 1939\\nhad lost their lives. Thus, Frank’s period as governor saw the\\ndeath of over 35% of the population. This would seem to mark Frank as one of the\\nmost brutal figures of the entire regime. Yet it could be argued that Frank himself\\nwas not overtly responsible for this level of death. Despite being known as ‘The Butcher of Poland’\\nand ‘The Jew Butcher of Krakow’, Frank was ultimately a governor with quite limited\\npowers in a country where the SS and the police services had greater power than any civilian\\ngovernor. In a sense, the head of the SS, Heinrich Himmler,\\nand a number of figures such as Franz Stangl, the commandant of Treblinka and Sobibor, were\\nactually those who oversaw the programmes of mass murder in southern Poland and western\\nUkraine, rather than Frank. Moreover, the governor was one of the only\\ndefendants at the first Nuremburg trial to exhibit any sense of remorse about his wartime\\nconduct. Ultimately, however, whatever the extenuating\\ncircumstances might have been, no retrospective remorse, no matter how genuine it possibly\\nwas, can absolve Frank of his crimes. Under his tenure as governor of the General\\nGovernment nearly three million Jews were killed there, as well as hundreds of thousands\\nof other Poles and Ukrainians, while countless more were deported to Germany as slave labourers,\\nmany of whom also faced death. Indeed in 1944 Frank boasted that there were\\nonly 100,000 Jews left alive in the area under his control. That ultimately is how he should be remembered,\\nnot as somebody who demonstrated remorse before a court in the aftermath of the war. What do you think of Hans Frank? Should he be condemned as severely as all\\nof the other senior Nazi officials or does his public repentance for his deeds in the\\nlast months of his life warrant a slightly less harsh appraisal of him? Please let us know in the comment section,\\nand in the meantime, thank you very much for watching.',\n",
       " \"The Jewish service of morning prayer,\\nShacharit, in Warsaw’s main synagogue. Led, proudly, by the\\nChief Rabbi of Poland. -The fact that there is noise behind me\\nbecause the people that had prayed are now having breakfast together\\nis a sign that there is Jewish life! A resurgence of Jewish life in Poland?\\nFor many, a highly unexpected development. This was the country that Nazi Germany\\nchose as the epicenter of a systematic genocide in which six million\\nJews died across Europe. -We don’t talk a\\nlot about Auschwitz. -This person has\\na gift. A great gift. -We desperately\\nneeded a Rabbi. -A Catholic bishop is among the various\\npublic figures attending this interfaith service in Warsaw. The host: Michael\\nSchudrich, Chief Rabbi of Poland. An interfaith prayer wishing that\\nanti-Semitism will finally disappear . . . -Change doesn’t happen overnight. It\\ntakes time, but as long as you see you’re going in the right direction, it gives\\nyou energy and it gives you hope. And it’s that hope that sustains the work\\nof Michael Schudrich. This is his office in Warsaw’s Nożyk Synagogue — also\\na HOME for the American-born rabbi. -You never find what you\\nwant when you need it . . . The son of a New York rabbi, he\\nfirst visited the country in the 1970s — in search of his roots. His grandparents had\\nleft Europe before the Second World War. In Communist-ruled Poland,\\nSchudrich found a few Jews struggling to preserve what\\nwas left of their heritage. -The diaries I wrote in 79, my\\nimpressions when I met different people, I remember one thing: Oh, this\\nperson has the mezuzah on the inside of the door and not on the outside,\\nand I thought that someone was being embarrassed to be Jewish. But I\\nrealized later that it was a tremendous statement of being Jewish because no\\none had it on the outside and almost no one had it on the inside. Having to\\nunderstand what something meant here. After the collapse of Communism, Schudrich\\n— now a rabbi himself — relocated to Warsaw and embarked on a mission: to re-establish\\nJewish religious life in Poland. -This is the first time that a Jewish\\nprayer book was reprinted in Poland after the fall of Communism. This is\\nthe original page, was from 1926. This is probably\\nfrom 91, 92. Before that, there were few if any Jewish\\nreligious books here. Now, thirty years on, Warsaw has a flourishing\\nJewish school again, with 200 students. This year will see the\\nfirst of them graduate. Joanna Niemirska’s children attend\\nthe school. Like thousands of other Polish Jews, it was only after the fall of\\nCommunism that she started to embrace her Jewish identity... thanks\\nalso to the dedication of Chief Rabbi\\nMichael Schudrich. The Jewish school has been a\\nblessing for Joanna Niemierska, her husband Lukasz\\nand their three children. -It’s so big luggage of problems... of\\npast...of everything that it’s never neutral. -And the minority here is a\\nreal minority. So, it’s real — sometimes it feels like we’re\\nall weirdos in our own country. -There’s a growing climate of trust. I\\nthink that’s the most important thing. Obviously, there are still many\\nprejudices and traumas left over from the Second World War. They’ve\\nbeen passed down from generation to generation. The war didn’t just destroy\\n— or at least try to destroy — human dignity; to a great extent, it also\\ndestroyed the mutual trust between people — including the trust between\\nthe Jewish and Polish peoples. It’s December and Hanukkah, the Jewish\\nFestival of Lights, is approaching. The rabbi offers some\\nguidelines to the teachers. -An important question is whether to\\ngive the children presents at Hanukkah. A few hundred years ago, there was\\nthe so-called “Hanukkah gelt.” Children were given money to buy themselves\\nsomething. Today, it’s perfectly fine to give Jewish children a small present\\non every Hanukkah evening. You don’t have to, of course. It used to be\\nHanukkah gelt, or some chocolate. We’re living here under strong Christian cultural\\ninfluences. The Christmas season is at a similar time of the year to Hanukkah.\\nSo, let’s give the children presents. Schudrich has been working in Poland for\\nthe past thirty years. The school is one of many funded by the American\\nphilanthropist Ronald S. Lauder to promote Jewish\\nlife in eastern Europe. -We needed somebody to go to Poland.\\nI heard about this rabbi named Michael Schudrich. So we brought him over.\\nWe saw him, and we said: “This is the right person.” We installed him in a\\nsynagogue — in ’90, ’91. And also was involved in the beginning, the start\\nof a school, a kindergarten. But what is interesting is that, the minute he got to\\nPoland, he became much more involved with the community, much more\\nPolish, and he started to learn Polish. -We desperately needed a rabbi — any\\nrabbi. But Michael Schudrich wasn’t just any rabbi. I remember his first trip. That\\nwas already Rychwald. So it must have been early nineties. He’d just arrived\\nafter flying nonstop from New York or so. He was that tired, but he still had\\na session with the teenagers, and they were pestering him with questions,\\nand eventually Michael, very tired, said, “Ok, guys! Tomorrow’s another day.\\nLet’s just sleep over it.” And he’s trying to rise from the armchair he was sitting\\nin, and the girls just shoved him back. “You don’t understand! We’re the\\nnext generation of Jewish mothers in this country. We need to\\nknow everything now!” Monika and Stanislaw\\nKrajewski remained faithful to their heritage even\\nduring the Communist era. -We had begun before that, you know,\\nmuch earlier. This is Monika’s book — the second one, by the way\\n— of the cemeteries in Poland. The Krajewskis researched this aspect of\\nJewish heritage first. Some 90 percent of the Jewish population of Poland\\nwere murdered during the German occupation. Most of those who survived\\ndid so by going underground or pretending to be Christian — and losing their\\nJewish identity. These old cemeteries are a precious reminder of Poland’s extensive\\nJewish population before the Holocaust. -It was like an eye-opener — eye opening\\nto the presence of the Jewish past. In my circle of friends there were many\\nwho had Jewish ancestry, but we didn’t learn anything Jewish. We\\ndidn’t feel Jewish when we were children because we\\nwere not introduced to it. The Krajewskis have been living their\\nlives in accordance with Jewish traditions and scripture for two generations now.\\nTheir son, Daniel, was prepared for his bar mitzvah — the Jewish coming of age\\nceremony for boys — by Rabbi Schudrich. The Chief Rabbi is now off\\non a trip to southern Poland. He’s constantly on the move. And\\nsometimes that means mobile conferencing in the car. Today, he’s talking to\\na Jewish community in Pittsburgh. He’s setting up an exchange program\\nfor young Jews from Poland and the U.S. -I think our biggest challenge on the\\nvery practical — and it is less, but still existing on follow-up — is we don’t\\nnecessarily have the professional staff to follow up\\nthe way we should. With a plethora of projects to watch over,\\nit often seems like too much for one man. -Who said it was going to be easy? I\\ncan say that the Jewish community of Poland in the last 30 years has gone\\nfrom a stagnating, dying, dysfunctional Jewish community to a re-emerging\\nvibrant dysfunctional Jewish community. We’re still dysfunctional, but at least now\\nwe’re alive; we’re vibrant, we’re creating. Today, there are once again Jewish\\ncommunities in nearly all of Poland’s larger towns and cities. Optimistic\\nestimates say the country is now home to up to 12 practicing Jews. This\\nrenaissance has led to a growing demand for kosher food. Today,\\nRabbi Schudrich is visiting three businesses catering to that\\ndemand. We’re only welcome to film in one: the\\nPravda vodka distillery. -The production line first — or the office?\\n-Production! Jewish dietary laws divide foodstuffs into\\nkosher and non-kosher. The Chief Rabbi checks production for\\ncompliance. Certain additives, such as pork-based gelatin,\\nare not permitted. -It happens to be that today they’re\\ndoing a production for Israel. ‘Cause it’s not always the stickers in Hebrew.\\nSo you can see: all these stickers are in Hebrew because\\nit’s going to Israel. After inspection, the firm is given\\nan international kosher certificate. Vodka is a popular drink\\nduring the Passover festival. -So, this here, you see, has someone\\nactually signed in Hebrew by our kosher supervisor. It’s with a lock here and here\\nand here and here. So we know that when we come back to the Passover production\\nthat it really is from that alcohol. Most of the kosher vodka\\nis for export, with only a fraction\\nstaying in Poland. -How important is this market\\nfor you to have a kosher product? -Passover, you mean? For Passover\\nproducts the main market is Israel. Also we produce and sell this product to\\nUnited States and to Republic of South Africa. Also some amounts we produce\\nand sell to Poland. And still we are trying to raise our market for kosher Passover\\nvodka and also for other kosher products. -So at least a share you are\\nselling in Poland, which means there is a market of\\nJewish people who . . . -Very small.\\n-It’s not a big community if you think about Polish Jewish people. But I think\\nthe most of the people who don’t know that their roots are from the Jewish community.\\nSo I think this is still in progress to have and to get the information\\nabout their roots and their generations. -Very well said. -I’m very happy that I wasn’t the\\nonly Jew who wanted to live as a Jew in Poland. Otherwise it would have\\nbeen a little bit lonely. But if those Jews eventually decide — and some do —\\nthat they want to live their Jewish lives elsewhere, it’s their free choice.\\nWe’re not making a religion out of Jews in Poland. It’s not an obligation, but it\\ncertainly is a right, and it gives me also a private satisfaction. We’re hard to\\nkill, and I would like to keep it that way. -Here’s another kosher certificate. I\\nknow the firm is just getting it renewed. -And this is the confirmation for kosher\\ndistillation. Excellent. Thank you. I hope I haven’t caused you\\ntoo many headaches. And the rabbi\\nleaves with a present. -Very important: It’s\\nkosher for Passover! So far, our impressions have\\nbeen positive. But Jewish-Gentile encounters don’t\\nalways run this smoothly. Relations with the Polish government\\nhave been strained recently. The right- wing nationalist government introduced\\nlegislation in 2018 that caused deep offense to Jewish sensibilities. It made\\nit illegal to suggest that the Polish state or people were in any way complicit in\\nthe Holocaust, perpetrated by the Nazis. -It basically was to defend the good\\nname of Poland; that Poland shouldn't be blamed for things that they didn't do.\\nBut there was then a great concern: But there were Poles that did bad things.\\nAnd how are we going to deal with that? And more importantly was the\\nproblem that the reaction . . . There were hurtful statements. There were\\nhurtful statements made by some Poles. There were hurtful statements\\nmade by some Jews. Protests met with a wave of anti-Semitic\\nrhetoric in the media and on the Internet. -The bill was controversial. On the one\\nhand, Poles feel insulted when the press in Europe or the international media\\nrefer to the German concentration camps as Polish death camps. It hurts\\nthe Poles. You have to understand that. The Polish people themselves\\nsuffered during the Second World War. Six million of them died, almost 25 percent\\nof the Polish nation. This legacy of the Second World War is embedded\\nin the consciousness of generations of Poles -- to this day. After all they\\nsuffered, they are extremely sensitive to claims that the Poles were responsible for\\nthe existence of the death camps in Poland. -At the end, it was an unnecessary\\nproblem that has more or less . . . is no longer. People remember it; but\\nit’s no longer a wound, it’s a scar. When international Jewish organizations\\nprotested, Warsaw held discussions with the Israeli government, and the\\nlegislation was watered down. Rabbi Schudrich played a mediating\\nrole. But he prefers to focus on the positive\\naspects of life in Poland. For instance, that Poland is represented\\nby people like Dariusz Popiela, a young kayaker who has competed for the\\ncountry at the Olympic games. Popiela is as busy as the Chief Rabbi, but he\\nstill finds time to get involved in the restoration of Jewish cemeteries — like\\nthe one in Grybów in southern Poland. For years, the cemetery\\nwas completely neglected. -We’re going to try and improve things\\nhere. First, I’ll launch an appeal on Facebook. We already have\\npermission. I’ve been busy, and otherwise I’d have come to get\\nthis fixed up much sooner. Popiela wanted to clear the cemetery\\nof weeds and restore its former dignity. Several months and a lot of hard\\nwork later, it’s re-opening. There’s a new memorial plaque listing the Jewish\\nresidents of this small village who were killed by the Nazis. For Rabbi\\nSchudrich, the commitment of these volunteers is\\nespecially appreciated. -With our presence here we express\\nour memory ... The Jewish Book of Life of the Grybów region was closed after\\nseveral centuries in August 1942. On the 20th of August the Nazis\\nstarted the Reinhardt-Operation. I would like to ask Chief Rabbi of Poland\\nMichael Schudrich to say a few words. -On the one hand, my heart is broken.\\nOn the other hand, I’m very happy today. It’s broken because the Jewish\\npeople of Grybów were killed simply because they were Jewish. I\\nwould like to thank our mayor for his words. He said that we must oppose\\nanger; we must oppose hatred when it is still small, and before it has spread.\\n... At the same time, my heart is happy. Who would have thought, when the\\nwar ended seventy-four years ago, that respect would be shown to the dead\\nin this Jewish cemetery once again; that the mass graves would be\\nmarked ... and remembered? In 1942 the Nazi regime finalized plans\\nto exterminate the entire Jewish population of Europe. As in Grybów, German troops\\ndissolved the ghettos in towns and cities throughout Poland. The Jews were\\nmurdered on the spot or transported to extermination camps. Projects like\\nDariusz Popiela’s try to establish the names of the victims, so\\nthat they are not forgotten. There are initiatives like this all over\\nPoland. For the past thirty years, the restoration work has been focusing on\\na few more towns or villages each year. Michael Schudrich considers\\nthis one of his key tasks. Often, Relatives of the people\\nburied here come from overseas to visit the cemeteries —\\nincluding from the US. -Part of my family, my niece, my sister, my\\nbrother in law, my wife is there somewhere. -The mass graves are especially\\nimportant because we talk about remembering the Holocaust, and that’s\\nessential. It’s an obligation of every good human being — not only Jews\\nand Germans. It’s an obligation of every good human being to remember what\\nhappened in the Holocaust. But if you think about it, perhaps the first thing\\nwe should do is to make sure that every victim of the Holocaust has a grave,\\nso far as that’s possible. We’ll never get close to having graves for six million\\nJews, but a hundred more, thirty more, even one more, is\\ntremendously valuable. It’s sometimes said that\\nMichael Schudrich is the rabbi of both the living and\\nof the dead in Poland. We visit Joanna and Lukasz and their\\nthree children: Ezra, Rema and Ninel. -Ezra was in Budapest for a student\\nexchange, and his English teacher was very happy when he came back, and\\nshe was like “very good progress after this trip.” Because there was no\\nchance to speak Polish there. Joanna is an actress and recently\\nappeared in a Swedish film. Her husband Lukasz is a theater director and has\\nbeen working in Slovakia. The couple value their international contacts. Lukasz\\nadmits that living openly as a Jew in Poland sometimes\\nmakes him feel insecure. -What was the tragic moment after the\\nwar in Poland was 1968. Because it was the moment half of my\\nfamily had to go out of Poland. 1968 brought further trauma to Polish\\nJews. Leading Communist party figures blamed the student protests at the time\\non a “Zionist plot” — triggering months of anti-Semitic incitement. Many Jews who had\\nsurvived the Shoah now fled the country. -Half of my life, I was the first person\\ntold there is no anti-Semitism in Poland. But now I am talking to myself:\\nWhere did you have your eyes and ears? -Anti-Semitism is prevalent throughout\\nthe world. It may be worse in Poland; it may be better. But it’s prevalent. A lot\\nhas to do with the Catholic Church. A lot has to do with just internet, hate\\nspeech, and all these things. But the result is: in a strange way anti-Semitism\\nin Poland propelled more kids into our school. And a result is we\\nbecame stronger and stronger. -I wouldn’t say that all members of the\\nChurch participate in the dialogue in the same way. I wouldn’t say that all\\nmembers of the Church are without prejudice. Maybe — actually, probably\\n— some are prejudiced. But these are really exceptions to the overall picture.\\nI’m thinking of the Second Vatican Council, which has had a direct\\ninfluence on the atmosphere in Poland and developments here. Believe me: I have the\\nfeeling that something great is happening. The Jewish Community Center or\\nJCC brings together Warsaw’s five congregations. It’s Sunday. Kosher brunch\\nfor Jews and Gentiles. The food is good, and it’s a popular meeting-place.\\nParents can relax while their kids learn handicrafts. Rabbi Schudrich\\nis a frequent visitor here, too. Joanna Niemirska and her\\nchildren try to come every weekend. Daniel Krajewski is also here. Suffering\\nfrom Down’s Syndrome is no obstacle to becoming a fully integrated\\nmember of the Jewish community. -It was very important to me that\\nI could celebrate my bar mitzvah — because I was born into a Jewish family.\\nAt the ceremony I said two blessings in Hebrew, and after reading from the\\nTorah I spoke about the Exodus from Egypt. Rabbi Schudrich simplified the bar\\nmitzvah procedure for the young man. He has known him since he was a\\nchild. Daniel Krajewski took part in the seminars Schudrich gave in the\\n1990s, when the Jewish revival began. The young Jewish community in\\nPoland has made great strides since its beginnings in a small village in southern\\nPoland thirty years ago. In the 1990s Schudrich organized seminars on\\nJewish life at an education center in Rychwald. Today it’s a hotel and\\nguesthouse for family get-togethers. This is the rabbi’s first time\\nback in many years. -I have no idea. I haven’t seen these\\npeople in fifteen, twenty years. I don’t know if I’ll recognize them. Maybe\\nthe same lady is working here. We would have had classes over here\\non the grass. Here we would sing; we would dance. We do everything,\\ntrying in our own little safe space that people see what\\nJudaism is about. -It’s impossible to be Jewish in\\nPoland and not feel the presence of the absence. So, of course, it was a\\nrecurrent topic in our conversations, and of course we never came up with\\nany extraordinary intelligent solutions to the problem\\nbecause there aren’t any. Decades after the Holocaust,\\nmany Polish Jews had become disconnected\\nfrom their roots. -There are all these stories that there\\nwas a time when people just realized — some of them — realized\\nthat they were Jewish . . . -Many of them.\\n-Many of them, you say? -And even those who knew never had a\\nchance to experience; they never had a Shabbat before. Some did, but\\nmany didn’t. And so it was really a first chance. It was also a chance just to\\nbe openly Jewish. You know, you don’t have to worry about anybody making\\na comment or wondering what it meant. In a lot of ways\\nit all started here. -We had a dinner at Hotel Victoria in\\n1989. I looked at these kids. They were not kids anymore, they were in their\\nthirties or forties, and I’ll never forget we were singing a song called Rozinkes\\nmit Mandlen — Raisins and Almonds — and we said: “We will sing a song that\\nyour real mother may have sung to you as children. All those, a hundred, who\\nremember the song, please join in.” And you know: first ten, then 20, then 80\\nkids, 80 of the 100, were singing a song from the subconscious sung\\nto them by their mother they have probably never\\nheard before since then. A year later, in 1990, the\\nLauder Foundation funded the first Jewish heritage\\nseminars in Rychwald. Thirty years ago, in this kitchen,\\na kosher meal was prepared for perhaps the first time\\nsince the Second World War. -At first it must have been strange for\\nyou. What WAS kosher food, for example? -Sure, at first. But\\nthen we got used to it. -Exactly! After the very first workshop,\\nthey knew how to cook. The staff got to know us and they soon learned the\\nsongs that we sang in the dining room. They also knew what happened on Friday evening\\nand on Saturday morning — for Shabbat. In Communist Poland, Jewish\\nlife was an abstract concept. -Before that, I only knew what I had\\nseen on TV. We didn’t know better. We were anxious about it. But that all\\nchanged when Michael came. -When children were listening to him,\\nspeaking about what was Jewish, what was important to them, it was so\\nspecial because he related to them. He got down to their level; he spoke with\\nthem. I saw him sitting on the floor and talk to them, reach out to them. This\\nwas the man; this was exactly the man. We realized\\nhe was special. Stanislaw and Monika Krajewski were two of\\nthe first participants. They were finally able to practice their Jewish faith openly.\\nNo need to hide and be discreet, as in the Communist era. Stanislaw\\neven led prayers sometimes. Many of those attending\\nwere Holocaust survivors. -During the war, they were children; they\\nwere not adult. Some of them were very little children or babies. Some of\\nthem were eight or ten, and they survived either because they were hiding\\nsomewhere or they were given to someone. Both of the Krajewskis\\nwere born after the war. -This was very helpful to make me\\nmore knowledgeable and to make me know how to do things regular Jews do\\nbecause this is not something I got from my family. Also this is true about\\nalmost all people of my generation and younger. So those who live in Poland\\nand were Jewish in some way in the 70s or in the 80s were mostly very assimilated\\nand very far from Jewish involvement. -We spend here, you know, eight\\nweeks a year for six, seven years. The rebirth of Jewish\\nreligious life in Poland began under somewhat\\nspartan conditions. -It was wonderful times,\\nwith very warm memories. -And here — this is where\\nwe had a little synagogue. A makeshift synagogue was set up\\nin an alcove of the education center. It marked a new beginning\\nfor Judaism in Poland. -Everything from basic things of Judaism\\n— Shabbat, kosher, holidays, history — to what does it mean to be Jewish, how does it\\nfeel to be Jewish. And also getting to know each other, icebreakers.\\nAnd sometimes fun things, we had everybody\\nre-enact a biblical scene. -And on Friday nights we would put all\\nthe different benches we could find, and we would have the prayer\\noutside. This was really everyone’s favorite\\nmoment of the week. But there was also criticism from\\nunexpected quarters. For some people, Jewish life in eastern Europe was\\nunimaginable after the Holocaust. -The fact is that Jewish people in\\nAmerica — particularly people who are second generation, whose parents fled\\nthe Holocaust — said: “Why do you want to do it?” And I said to these people,\\n“Because there are Jewish kids there, and we must do what we\\ncan to give them a Jewish life.” -It is ridiculous to protest the gains\\nand the rebirth of Jewish life where it had been murdered. Because you don’t\\nregulate life. Jews have a right to live, and live as Jews, wherever they want.\\nIf this is the only problem, then we need to get out of Europe. Europe is a\\ngraveyard. It’s particularly visible around Auschwitz. But if anybody\\nwith Jewish historical sensitivity travels around Europe,\\nit is a place of death. -And it was very painful. After this\\njourney back, to be said that you don’t really exist because there can’t be\\nJews here, was very painful. And wrong. The seminar buildings where this Jewish\\nrenaissance began are just an hour’s drive from the infamous\\nextermination camp Auschwitz-Birkenau. -And there’s another point we should\\npoint out. When we go up this kind of bridge, you look to the left and to the\\nright, and you see train tracks. Lots and lots of train tracks. And you understand\\nwhy the Germans built the biggest death camp here — because you\\nhave the crossroads of so many different train tracks from all over\\nEurope. That is a clear point. When you see it here, you\\nunderstand why did they build it here. -Actually, I think it gets harder to visit\\nthis place than easier. When it really became harder? There were two\\nthings: Once my daughter was born, so in a natural way when you walk here, you\\ndon’t have children, you think: Could I have survived? And once you have a\\nchild, you think: Could your child have survived? And there it becomes a\\ncompletely different experience. And the other thing for many, many Jews\\nit’s, I mean, it’s a horrible place for any human being to be. For Jews\\nit also becomes personal — because many of us\\nhave family that was here. -Gas chamber three, Gas chamber four,\\nGas chamber five. And this is the Sauna. The rabbi travels to Auschwitz-Birkenau\\nseveral times each year. Many visitors from Israel and the US ask to meet\\nhim at the site where their relatives were murdered. He’s also a senior religious\\nadvisor to the Auschwitz Foundation, which administers the site —\\nas a museum AND a memorial. Rabbi Schudrich says keeping\\nthe memory alive is crucial. -It seems that, in Europe, the shock\\nof the Holocaust, of this genocide, the worst genocide in history, kind of\\nsilenced those people who refused to learn the lesson. And it seems now,\\n75 years later, although many people do know the lesson, there are those who\\nnever knew the lesson and now want to speak in a loud voice denying the\\nHolocaust, belittling the Holocaust. So, well, some people are saying: “No,\\nwe’ve learnt nothing,” that’s not true. Humanity has learned a lot. It doesn’t\\nmean that all of humanity has learned everything. And so, even standing in\\na place like this, I am hopeful. Because you just see the numbers of people\\nvisiting today, gives hope that they will be changed when they leave.\\nHow can you be the same person? Michael Schudrich’s uncle, an Austrian\\nJew from Vienna, was a prisoner in Auschwitz. In August 1944, Henry\\nStarer was brought there on one of the last deportation trains from the\\nGerman concentration camp at Theresienstadt in\\ntoday’s Czech Republic. -When I saw what they did with some of\\nthe babies on the platform of Auschwitz? They slaughtered them. They threw\\nthem up in the air; they shot at them. They came down like birds in\\nfront of their mother. How terrible. -This is the place where Josef Mengele\\nwould go like this. And my uncle told me the story when they arrived on the train\\nfrom Theresienstadt.... In Theresienstadt the World War I veterans were treated\\nbetter because there was some level of Jewish self-government in\\nTheresienstadt — some level — but at least there the veterans were treated\\nbetter. Here they were lined up five- five-five. And they were in the same line\\nas some World War I veterans. Mengele sent the veterans straight to the gas\\nchamber, and my uncle and his brother followed immediately with them,\\nfiguring they were going to a better place — based on their experience of\\nTheresienstadt. And then Mengele had his guards kick my uncle and his brother\\nto the other side, saying: “You, Jew, can’t decide your fate.” A Jew\\ncouldn’t even decide to be killed. And so, ironically, Mengele saved my\\nuncle’s life. Which is bizarre. Henry Starer survived Auschwitz and\\nemigrated to the United States, where he started his own family. Michael\\nSchudrich learned a lot from his uncle. -My uncle was one of those who\\nspoke quite frequently about it. So I can’t remember if I was eleven or thirteen;\\ncertainly by thirteen. But I can’t tell you from what age. Certainly when\\nI was in high school, this was something Uncle Henry\\nwould tell me about. -How important was this for your\\nidea to be interested in Eastern Europe? Did this play\\na role or not? -Absolutely, yes. To what extent? The\\nidea is that I very much took away from that, I think. I took away from\\nthat: you can’t be indifferent. If something is wrong,\\nyou have to try and fix it. It’s December — Christmas in\\nWarsaw, the capital of Catholic Poland. The Jewish community is celebrating\\nHanukkah, the festival of lights. The opening event is, as\\nalways, open to the public. Warsaw’s Jews are no longer\\na clandestine community. -Simply put, it was the\\nplace I was supposed to be. Michael Schudrich has dedicated the past\\nthirty years of his life to re-establishing Jewish religious life in Poland —\\ncommitted to keeping memory alive, and to working for the\\npresent ... and the future. -It looks like it’s still the\\nplace I am supposed to be.\",\n",
       " \"Today, I want to discover Gdańsk with you,\\na port city on the Baltic coast in the north of Poland. While Gdańsk has a special meaning\\nnot only for Poland, but for the whole of Europe. Do you want to know more?\\nYou can't tell by looking at scenic Gdańsk You can't tell by looking at scenic Gdańsk that it's a city in Europe marked by fate.\\nBut: We'll get to that in just a minute. With its historic center, Gdańsk is one of\\nthe most popular city destinations in Poland. Pre-pandemic, 1.5 million tourists vacationed\\nhere annually, mostly Germans and Scandinavians. But Poland borders Ukraine, and with the war\\nright next door, people are staying away. There are 60 percent fewer foreign tourists. The old port on the Motława River.  Without it, the Gdańsk of today would not exist. \\nIt's lined with cafés and restaurants. In the Middle Ages, it made Gdańsk\\nthe richest city in Europe. I feel like going for a ride on the pirate ship. It casts off several times a day. This boat trip is perfect for a little break. The city is seamlessly connected to the port,\\nwhich has developed around Gdańsk over the centuries. It's the biggest port in Poland\\nwith one of the largest repair yards in the world. For the people of Gdańsk, these cranes \\nare a symbol of home. Most of them belong to the\\nold shipyard which is the soul of the city. Well, and not only that. This is a place \\nthat fundamentally changed Europe. The famous Gdańsk shipyard. Over 40 years ago, there was a strike here\\nby shipyard workers and with that began the decline of socialism in Poland and the end\\nof communism in Europe. The struggle for workers' rights gained momentum\\nhere. Millions of Poles organized themselves in the Solidarność movement, fighting for\\nfreedom and democracy under an authoritarian regime. The European Solidarity Centre at the former\\nshipyard tells this story. Right above the entrance – the Ukrainian flag. Anna Walentynowicz was a crane operator and later a founding member of the Solidarność\\nor Solidarity trade union. Solidarność. This worker activism turned into\\nan anti-communist opposition movement. It spread across the whole country. \\nThe authoritarian regime increased the pressure. They reached their goals with \\nthe principle of non-violence. Lech Wałęsa, a trained electrician and trade\\nunion leader led Poland to independence. In 1990, he became president \\nand remained so for 5 years. These activists created change\\nin a hopeless situation. This is what the Solidarność movement\\nstill stands for today. You can guess what I wish for. Pax: Peace! Today, ships are no longer \\nbeing built in the Gdańsk shipyard.  The area is still occasionally used by companies. \\nMost of the production halls are empty. It's a lost place for the time being. \\nBut there are plans to create a new, chic urban district here based on the model of\\nLondon's Docklands or Hamburg's HafenCity. With apartments, shops, and offices.\\nThe old shipyard area is like a huge adventure The old shipyard area is like \\na huge adventure playground,  because the investor has left\\nthe empty spaces to artists, and now you can find galleries, rehearsal rooms, and studios here. This character looks a bit like me. We have the same nose. The gallery Mleczny Piotr. An artist collective\\nhas found a temporary home here. The building was a factory for 170 years, where \\nthe people of Gdańsk had no access. Now visitors are always welcome. Great, ah, okay, it’s a magnifying glass for tools? Yeah yeah. You know what this is? \\nIt's from a car. - It's a lamp. \\n- This a lamp from a car, yeah. There are more spots in the shipyard that\\npeople in Gdańsk have taken over and filled with new life. The 100cnia is a container settlement \\nwith lots going on. Here you can be loud and party until the early morning. And you can meet cool people. On the very spot where the democracy movement \\nin Poland began more than 40 years ago, life and freedom are now being celebrated. Gdańsk gives us hope that history can change for\\nthe better at any time. I really have to say, Gdańsk is impressive.\\nIt's not just a big city by the sea with a beach, a beautiful old town, and, well, this\\nreally cool shipyard. In this city, you can also feel \\nthe history of Europe around every corner. So Gdańsk is a place you should visit.\",\n",
       " \"[Music] [Applause] first question can a poor country reasonably aspire to become a high income one within a few years second question how much time would they really need and third question how would they do it dear viewer these are some of the most common questions that you send us here on this channel we've seen in various videos how several countries have managed to change their luck and become locomotives well dear viewer in this video i want to tell you about a very particular case i want to tell you about poland because poland's becoming something of a new germany well listen up [Music] here's a question for you and as always please do not google it which do you think is the city with the most polish inhabitants warsaw maybe krakow well wrong actually it would be chicago two million polish people live in chicago yes we are really not kidding here dear viewer it's not been easy for poles during the second world war poland was the country that suffered the most no less than one out of every five poles that's almost six million people which is the conservative estimate by the way lost their lives and after that disaster they endured 44 years of a communist government who in addition to exerting an enormous amount of political repression also left them as a poor country in 1989 when this system came to an end poland's per capita income was between three and five times smaller than that of developed countries such as italy france or the united kingdom but just hold on a second because things they've really changed [Music] poland a country located halfway between paris and moscow and has 40 million inhabitants completely changed its model and since they've done this their economy has grown by over 4 every year [Music] [Applause] all right so now you might be thinking did i just put too much emphasis on four percent a year because it doesn't sound that impressive i mean this is especially if you compare it to the pretty crazy growth rates that you can see in the asian tigers four percent kind of sounds like a joke right well folks if you are thinking that you are missing a couple of important details the first is that we're talking about almost 25 years of uninterrupted economic growth here not even the great crisis of 2008 and 2009 really affected this country at all we could say that poland's moving kind of like a giant cargo ship it's not the fastest ship on the water for sure but it has moved an incredible distance [Music] put another way young polish people have pretty much no idea what an economic crisis is like [Music] the second detail is also very important here because unlike what happened with the asian tigers poland has had this huge growth while being a consolidated democracy and by the way that really kind of dispels an important myth here and that's that countries need a strong hand in order to grow well anyway thanks to this growth poland has had an amazing 25 years this country has gone from having average salaries of between 10 to 15 000 american dollars per month to having a per capita income taking into account each country's price difference that in 2018 will be higher than that of greece portugal and every latin american country and the reality is it's also not really that far behind spain or italy either but having gotten to this point i think there's a question that we really need to answer how did they achieve this well listen up because that's what we're going to talk about in today's video [Music] the end of an era for 44 years from 1945 to 1989 the socialist state of the people's republic of poland a satellite country of the soviet union was in power by the way to give you an idea of how great moscow's control was it's said that when in 1950 the polish leader boloslaw beret showed joseph staley himself a draft of the future polish constitution that the leader of the soviet union made dozens of corrections by hand which of course were taken into account anyway the polish regime was one of the least harsh in the entire soviet orbit for example most of the land wasn't collectivized the catholic church was allowed to function with relative freedom and even though political repression was high it wasn't quite as intense as it was in other countries [Music] even so of course as in any good socialist country the state controlled almost everything and in 1989 its economy completely shattered now thanks to all these small freedoms a real political opposition emerged led among others by lec valencia the leader of the independent solidarity union the first free union of all eastern european countries thanks to this when the soviet union's power began to crumble poland became the first country in eastern europe to set its political transition in motion to completely abandon communism and so on june 4th 1989 the first relatively free elections were held and with that was no turning back [Music] shock therapy just a few months after the first elections in september of 1989 the minister of finance lessek balceravits set a plan on the table to shred the entire communist fabric and replace it with a capitalist model three months later this shock therapy as it's been known was launched poland exerted a liberal program called shock therapy the idea was either the patient improves or dies from one day to the next everything was liberalized in a very rigid and centralized economy in which prices and needs had nothing to do with reality he called it the lunar economy everything was fiction piotr pineagenia olshinsky polish diplomat suddenly everything changed prices were liberalized controls were lifted people were able to set up private businesses they stopped printing money the economy began to open up to the world and a plan was launched to privatize public enterprises so within a short time not even the polls could recognize poland also the government had a very clear idea about the future poland needed to get as far away from russia as possible and strengthen its ties with the rest of europe and the united states so was the result of all of this well a few years later they joined both the european union and nato now what model do you think the country has followed since then [Music] [Music] change of course now we've already told you plenty of times the world is getting better poverty is decreasing and countries are getting richer but despite this belonging to the club of rich countries is still a difficult mission even so everything points to poland achieving this within a very short amount of time dear viewer this country is becoming eastern europe's germany [Music] [Applause] see poland has become an industrial powerhouse flooded with multinationals and like in germany its small and medium-sized companies have begun to cross the border the result since 1989 its foreign trade has multiplied by more than 25. polish exports amount to almost 200 billion dollars per year which represents more than 40 percent of the country's gdp which is a seriously high number [Music] this simply explains why polish roads are full of trucks so now you must be wondering well how are they achieving all of this what on earth is the key to their success well dear viewer take note here the polish recipe has four main ingredients first the establishment of institutions that attract a lot of foreign investment legal security property rights ease of setting up companies and competition for example 14 special economic zones have been created where any interested company can gain many advantages second strict controls of public accounts poland's government is one of the most healthy in the european union public debt for example is barely 50 percent of the gdp and almost as importantly since 1989 they have been set on fighting inflation so no printing bills to finance the government basically the opposite of countries like argentina [Music] third quality education you heard that right poland has managed to make their educational system work and they've done it without wasting huge amounts of money its rate of university students is higher than the average of the european union 9 out of 10 young people complete secondary education and according to international studies the polish education system is one of the 10 best not just in europe but in the whole world [Music] and fourth there's moderate taxes for example companies are taxed 19 while small companies are taxed 15. and income tax breaks down into two brackets 18 for the first 24 000 and 32 for the rest [Music] and in addition because poland is a fairly conservative country families have even more advantages so if we take into account both personal taxes and pension payments poland is the fourth oecd country where families pay less direct taxes [Music] so it's with these four ingredients that poland has managed to become eastern europe's germany an export and industrial power with a healthy government and a quality of life that just keeps on growing the best proof of this is perhaps that within a few years the great power of the east has gone from being a country of immigrants to a country of immigrants [Music] from a country of immigrants to a country of immigrants in recent years if something has characterized the polish economy it's the simple availability of work unemployment is approaching six percent and many companies are beginning to have a problem finding workers initially foreign companies would only look for highly experienced employees with titles now they take everyone and give them a month of training if necessary roman polik entrepreneur and of course if companies need a lot of workers and can't find them while wages go up the average gross salary in the first quarter of 2018 was 7.1 percent higher than in the same period in 2017. average gross salary exceeds 1400 per month the central statistics office of poland and you know what this situation has led to well first many young poles who until recently left on mass to richer european union countries now are deciding to stay [Music] and second in recent years more than two million ukrainians have settled in poland especially young people looking for better opportunities than the ones they could find in their country of origin this means that poland now has more people arriving than leaving [Music] now as we always say visualpolitik not everything is so great poland is facing quite a serious aging problem and the law and justice party a very nationalist and very conservative party won every recent election and now controls the country some of their decisions have caused the european union to threaten poland with sanctions and even suspend their rights as a member but that's something we're going to address in a future video now it's your turn do you think poland would be a good example for cuba or would the chinese model actually be better well leave your answer in the comments section below as well as in this survey and i really hope you enjoyed that video if you did please don't forget to subscribe to our channel for brand new videos also do not forget to check out our friends at the reconsider media podcast they provided the vocals in this episode they were not mine and as always thank you for watching [Music] [Music]\",\n",
       " \"Growing up in the US I had the impression that\\nPolish people were everywhere. And now that I live in Poland I wonder how\\nmuch my fellow Americans know about the great country. So on today’s episode of Kult America\\nI'm interviewing everyday americans to see just what they know about Poland. What do you know about the country of Poland? Not very much. Not much. Not much, unfortunately. We're making a street survey, I just want\\nto ask like three questions about the country of Poland. Oh I don't know anything about the country\\nof Poland. I've never been to Poland, so... I can't really say. Not much. No, have you ever heard of Poland before? What did you hear? World War II stuff. Okay. That's basically it. Do you know who invaded Poland in the WWII? Was that France? I know Hitler invaded Poland, under false\\npretense, they say. During WWII it was taken over by Russia, and.. I won't say his name right but\\nWałęsa kinda was the one who, I would say, helped to break\\nthe barrier of that oppression, and kinda make it the free state again,\\nI guess it's own country again. Saint John-Paul II is from Poland, Kraków. We’ve got Thaddeus Kościuszko’s House. That’s over.. Is that Third and Pine? Thadeusz’s House? And then we have Polish-American museum. That's right! On Third one, yeah. He helped to win in the battles of Saratoga,\\nand handled West point. Could you say that he's an american hero,\\na Polish-American hero? Oh yeah, absolutely, of course. Do you know what kind of food\\npeople eat in Poland? Polish food. You know I'm not positive,\\nthey're maybe the pierogi people, and I'm not sure whether they\\nwould be also kielbasy and things like that\\nbut good stuff. Oh, wow, they... Man. I can tell you Czech and Slovakia. And what language do people speak in Poland? I don't know, English? Have you had any interactions\\nwith Polish people? No. What continent is Poland on? That's easy. Oh that's in Europe. West of Russia, East of Germany. I know that it has a long history of both\\nhaving been.. It's gotta strong catholic background, gotta\\nlot of strong cultural elements. It's been subject of military invasions because it's so flat so it's easy for people\\nto come from either side, but nonetheless culturally people in Poland\\nhave a very strong sense if their self-value. I actually don't know a lot about Poland. I'd like to know more about it. So to the best of my knowledge it seems that\\nPoland is kind of irrelevant place for the majority of Americans. Some people were a little bit nervous and\\nI think reserved to talk about obvious things they knew about the country, but generally\\nspeaking the conclusion I can come to is that Poland simply does not matter for everyday\\npeople here in America. Anyways, I asked people to give a message\\nto the people of Poland in this video. And now I would like to ask the people in\\nPoland to give a message to America in the comment section. If you have any thoughts or feelings on America\\nin terms of how they view you, let me know in the comments. Thank you so much for watching Kult America\\nand I will see you next time. Sorry I don't know as much about you guys,\\nas you probably know about America, but I'll be better with it. All love here though. No disrespect Peace around the world. Peace to everybody, especially to the people in Poland. Poland's been a very brave country,\\ndealt with communism and the thread and Russian\\nor Soviet invasion and responses. I'm glad you guys support the world.\",\n",
       " \"We start in Krakow. It's like the Boston of Poland,\\na charming and vital city buzzing with history,\\ncollege students and tourists. Even though Poland's\\npolitical capital moved from here to Warsaw\\n400 years ago, Krakow remains the country's cultural\\nand intellectual Center. The city's history is rich,\\nits sights are fascinating, and the prices are some\\nof Europe's lowest. This is a country where\\n the most expensive cafe on the most\\nexpensive perch serves drinks for a fraction\\n of what you'd expect. The charm of today's Krakow\\nlies in its medieval roots. Krakow grew wealthy from trade\\nin the 12th century. Traders passing through were\\nrequired to stop for a few days and sell their goods\\nat a discount. Local merchants then resold\\ntheir wares at a profit and the city thrived. In the 13th century the \\nTartars -- a.k.a. the Mongols -- swept in from Asia\\n and destroyed Krakow. Resilient Krakovians\\ntook this opportunity to rebuild their city with\\n a near-perfect grid plan, a striking contrast to the\\n narrow, maze-like lanes of most medieval towns. Eventually Krakow's\\npower waned. Warsaw emerged\\nas the dominant city in Poland and Krakow became\\na provincial backwater of the Habsburg Empire\\nruled from Vienna. While Warsaw was\\nin the sphere of Moscow and, therefore, more Eastern\\nand conservative, Krakow has long been\\nmore Western and liberal.\",\n",
       " 'This is the largest protest in Poland since the fall of communism\\nmore than 30 years ago. Hundreds of thousands are protesting,\\nin cities across the country, because the party in power here is on the verge\\nof eliminating a woman’s right to an abortion. At the heart of these protests are young women: those who are the most\\nthreatened by the new ruling. But there are many, many others too. And that’s because these protesters\\naren’t just concerned about the future of abortion rights in Poland. They’re worried about the future\\nof the country itself. In the late 1980s, Poland got rid\\nof its decades-long communist regime.   Soon, it became a thriving democracy,\\nwith a strong catholic identity. It also passed one of the strictest laws on abortion in all of Europe. Under the law, women were only allowed \\nto have an abortion under three circumstances: if the pregnancy was a threat\\nto the health of the mother, if it was the result of incest or rape, or if the fetus had severe\\nand irreversible abnormalities. The law has remained this way\\nfor nearly 30 years.  And today, it makes Poland an outlier in Europe, where virtually every other country allows \\nabortions under a broad range of circumstances. But some in Poland thought\\nthose strict laws still weren’t enough. In 2015, Poland elected the right-wing party\\nLaw and Justice into power. Shortly after, the party leader said: \"Very close to the totalitarian way of thinking, as far as women\\'s health, women\\'s rights,\\nand women\\'s personhood is concerned.\" In 2016, the party backed legislation \\nto eliminate all three legal paths to abortion.  The legislation proposed imprisoning\\nwomen seeking abortions, and doctors who performed them,\\nfor up to five years. They would even investigate miscarriages. \"This is something that is incredible, you know? It really turns us back to the Middle Ages. The limitation of human rights went far too far.\" Thousands of women took to the streets, pushing back against the law,\\nin what were called the Black Protests. In the face of this opposition,\\nthe legislation was withdrawn. Poland would still have one of the strictest abortion laws in Europe,  but not a total ban. But instead of giving up on the abortion ban, Law & Justice started dismantling\\nthe country’s ability to oppose one. In Poland’s democracy,\\nsome legislation passed by Parliament is sent to the Constitutional Tribunal, to ensure it’s consistent\\nwith the country\\'s constitution. This court has 15 judges, and it serves\\nas the main check on the ruling party. It’s supposed to function as an independent\\nbranch of the government.  But upon taking power, Law & Justice\\nstarted to erode that independence. They refused to swear in several judges who had been appointed\\nby the previous government, and replaced them with judges\\nwho would be loyal to them, including the Tribunal president, who has the ability to determine\\nwhich judges hear what cases. And of the judges they have appointed legally,\\nmany are actually fellow politicians, further compromising\\nthe independence of the court. This has created a tribunal in which\\n14 of 15 judges are aligned with the ruling party.  And the legitimacy of several\\nof them is widely disputed, both in Poland and internationally. This version of the court has never\\ndecided a case against the ruling party. \"The fact that this Constitutional Tribunal\\nis acting on the behalf of the political party is just the opposite of what\\nthe Constitutional Tribunal should do.\" It was under these circumstances\\nthat Law & Justice sought a new ruling from the Constitutional Tribunal\\non the country’s abortion laws, that would eliminate one of the three bases\\nfor legal abortion: Severe fetal abnormalities. And while it might seem like that\\nwould only prevent some abortions, fetal abnormalities are the reason\\nfor 98% of abortions in Poland. In other words, without\\ntechnically banning abortions, the change would make them\\nvirtually impossible. Nearly 80% of Poles\\ndisagreed with this change. But on October 22nd, the Constitutional\\nTribunal ruled in its favor: That the overwhelming majority of abortions\\nin Poland were unconstitutional. The ruling brought Poles back into the streets, and in much bigger numbers than in 2016. \"These protests are really different from\\nwhat we\\'ve seen for the last four years, because there are thousands and thousands\\nof young people attending these protests, organizing these protests, and also, these are the most grassroots, \\nindependent protests that we\\'ve ever had.\" In the face of the protests,\\nthe government has delayed taking the steps that would make the ruling official. As of this video, it’s unclear when,\\nor if, they will. But these protests are as much about\\nhow this ruling came together, as they are about the ruling itself. MARTA LEMPART: \"It started with abortion.\\nNow we fight for freedom, for everything.\" For the rule of law.\" Outside of Poland, the world has noticed.  International organizations have stopped considering it a full democracy. And the changes to its legal system have put\\nPoland’s European Union membership at risk. 30 years ago, Poland enthusiastically\\nembraced democracy. Today, its ruling party is trying to rig the\\ncountry’s democratic institutions in its favor. And it\\'s the people\\nwho are fighting to protect them. \"Despite the fact that this government\\nis responsible for destroying all the democratic tools\\nthat we have in our Constitution, you still have the nation,\\nthe citizens in this country, who carry on the democratic values.\"',\n",

       " 'Do you remember that\\ncontainer ship, the Ever Given, that got stuck in the\\nSuez Canal back in 2021? The final report\\ninto what happened came out a few months ago,\\nas I record this, and there were a lot of\\nthings that went wrong. It was travelling too fast, there were communications\\nproblems between the crew and the local pilots, and there was the\\nbank effect. There are two ways\\nto learn what that is. You can get the\\ntheoretical explanation that big ships get\\nsucked to the sidewalls by pressure differences when travelling\\nat speed along canals. But if that seems\\na bit abstract, you can learn it hands-on. Because this is the Port Iława Ship Handling\\nResearch and Training Centre in the north of Poland. And this is one of the places where the folks who\\nsteer those big ships learn how to do it. Just to be clear, I\\'m not\\ngetting a full training course. That takes days\\nand includes a huge amount of theory work\\nand study as well. I\\'m just going to drive a\\nminiature container ship for a lap around\\nthe lake, and... hopefully not get it\\nstuck in the Suez Canal. We have started our\\ntraining activity in 1980. In the \\'90s, we have moved from\\nthe old lake towards this one, and practically first training\\nhere was realized in 1991, more or less 30 years ago. We are performing\\ntraining in ship handling. We have a lot of\\ndifferent mockups presenting\\ndifferent waterways. Everything was built using\\nexactly the same scale, 1:24. Deep waters,\\nshallow waters, different restrictions,\\nrivers, canals. And what is more important? Of course, ship models. Permission to come aboard? Granted.\\n(laughs) Okay. This is bigger than I thought\\nit was going to be. It\\'s one of the\\nbiggest in the world. 400 metre ship. 400 metre? Scaled down 1:24,\\nthat\\'s still... 16 and a half. That\\'s— Okay,\\nthis is big, cool. We can proceed.\\nDead slow ahead. So dead slow ahead?\\nYep. And steady as she goes.\\nForward. I assume that means just\\nkeep it going straight, okay. These are the\\ntugboat simulators. Oh, I don\\'t feel\\nguilty about you... You\\'ve taken\\nthe controls here. I\\'d be on tugboats going out. I was meant to be asking\\nall sorts of questions here, and I\\'m just slightly nervous\\nabout driving a tiny boat. It\\'s not a tiny boat. It\\'s a 400m container ship. Yep. So you have\\ncontrols there that simulate the effect\\nof tugs on the boat. Right, four tugs. You may make a\\nrather hard to port. Hard to port? I don\\'t know why... but I thought I was\\ngoing to spin that like the wheel of a\\npirate ship, and it\\'s just a...\\nYeah. Alright, so\\nwhat\\'s our plan now? Okay, so now we can go\\nthrough the lock if you like. Yeah, absolutely. Basically we go that direction,\\nsouth of the island. I feel like I need\\nto go left here. Yeah, make it port 10.\\nPort, not left. We have had, in our history, more than 6,000 pilots,\\nmasters, and chief officers from more than 50 countries. On average, 220–230 a year. We have beginners, but we have also very\\nexperienced masters. Because the lock\\nis very shallow... Yeah.\\nWe will have only 2cm of water\\nunder the keel. If we have too high a speed,\\nwe touch the bottom. So the faster I go\\nin shallow water, the more the boat is going to\\nget sucked down to the ground. More squat\\nyou have, yeah. We have to come\\nin line with the lock. Oh!\\nSooner we do that, more time we have to apply\\nany correction if necessary. That is such a tight\\nspot to navigate through. Hard to starboard\\nfor a while. Hard to star—\\nStarboard, starboard. The minute I feel like\\nI\\'ve got this... It\\'s all going to fall apart. Uh, midships? Yes, please.\\nYep. And starboard— yep.\\nStarboard 20. And midships, yep. Oh, I think I\\'ve\\novercorrected there! There\\'s some very strong work being done by the\\ntugboats here, thank you. We have no clearance here! I feel like starboard slightly? Yeah, starboard 20.\\nStarboard 20. (winces) I can\\'t see how\\nclose we are there. Did we clear that?\\nYes. I think we cleared that.\\nYes! (wheezes) Again,\\nsolid tugboat work. Midships, surely. Starboard 20.\\nOkay! The basic training\\nprogram takes five days. A linear scale, 1:24, means that timescale is equal\\nto more or less five. It means everything happens five times faster\\nthan in reality. And feeling for a ship\\nmay be affected. It\\'s a disadvantage. But on the other hand,\\nfive days of training will correspond to 25 days\\nof training in reality. Hard to starboard.\\nHard to starboard. I\\'m more the helmsman\\nthan the captain at this point, thank you. Hard to port again. Hard to port.\\nLeft hand down a bit! Okay, I think we\\ncan make half ahead. Half ahead. We are clear of the lock. Oh, yeah. Phew! Full ahead.\\nFull ahead! (both laughing) Did I need to slam that\\nforward so dramatically? Absolutely not, but... Our first models\\nwere really very simple. Nothing inside. Just wheel,\\nengine telegraph, and that\\'s it. And step by step... we have started to add\\ndifferent facilities. We have electronic navigation. It means a very precise\\nGPS system, which allows to measure a\\ngiven ship model trajectory with precision equal to\\none, maybe two centimetres. Suddenly the nerves\\nhave gone. Open ocean. Open lake. Starboard 10.\\nStarboard 10. \\'Cause you\\'ve\\ngot to cancel out what you\\'ve just given it, right?\\nYeah. We\\'re still going\\nquite strongly to port just because that input from...\\nThe wind. Ages ago, and the wind?\\nDue to the wind, yeah. I\\'m amazed how much\\nthe wind is affecting this. You have to imagine\\nthat such a ship, fully loaded, has about 20,000\\nsquare metres with the windage area. (heavy sigh) Everything during\\nexercises is measured, sent to our classroom,\\nand in case of problems, we can discuss step by step, and we can show where\\nmistakes were made. Ooh! ...I\\'m sorry, I got\\ndistracted by a cormorant. (both chuckle) Current, especially in\\nthe case of shallow water, is a big problem. It means we have\\ncurrent generators. This current velocity can be\\nchanged according to our needs. (metal colliding) I thought we hit something. Oh, we did.\\nThat\\'s me, sorry. No problem.\\n(nervous chuckle) It\\'s not like this thing\\nhas rear-view mirrors. Okay, half ahead. Half ahead? We\\'re sailing a\\nmassive container ship down the Suez Canal. Do I need to put a little\\nbit of rudder in here? Yeah, it\\'s fine. Now you\\nhave to go behind Varta. Right.\\nYou can make a port 10. Port 10, got it. I think we\\'re clear\\nof the red buoy. Midship.\\nMidships. (winces)\\nNo, no, it\\'s clear. Okay. Port 20.\\nPort 20. Midships.\\nMidships. Okay. And a full ahead. Full ahead, okay! Starboard 20.\\nStarboard 20. Because we\\'ve got to\\nease out the turn. Then you will start\\nfeeling the bank effect from the starboard wall. Okay. Hard to starboard. So it feels like\\nI could go midships now. We should just go straight\\ndown the middle of this canal. Except... The bank effect,\\nyou see, bow is coming out. It means the repulsion\\nforce pushes the bow. Now you have to make\\na hard to starboard. Hard to starboard.\\nGah, yeah! I\\'m being sucked\\ntowards the port wall! I\\'m putting full\\nright lock on here. Midships.\\nMidships, okay. You see, again, it\\'s coming. Yep... it is! So we have to make\\nhard to starboard. Hard to starboard, yeah,\\nif I don\\'t do hard to starboard— You would have hit this wall.\\nYeah. I\\'m absolutely gonna\\nram that if we\\'re not careful. Yeah. That\\'s so powerful!\\nMidships. Yep. Yeah, hard to starboard.\\nHard to starboard. I was midships. We should have been\\ngoing straight ahead. And I think...\\nI think... I have to help you\\nwith that task. Yeah, you\\'re going\\nto have to help with that. I should\\'ve done that earlier. Everybody down. Clear.\\nOh, cleared?! Midship. Hard to port now.\\n(bewildered laugh) Hard to port. You were lucky,\\none inch clear. That was more luck than\\ngood judgment, that was! Our research is focused\\non ship handling. It means interaction\\nforces, and... autonomous ships. We have started realisation of\\nresearch programs three or four years ago,\\nbecause... autonomous ships\\nwill be really very popular. We need at least\\nten ships\\' lengths... Yeah.\\n...to stop the ship. Ten ships\\' lengths? And that harbour is here. Oh, I definitely need\\nto put some port in. Yes. Hard to port.\\nPort 20. Hard to port, okay. Everything in case\\nof our training centre is realised in real conditions. You can feel very well\\nwind, you can feel very well\\ncurrent, and everything what deals\\nwith weather conditions. Such a situation\\ndoes not happen in case when using\\ncomputer simulators. And... especially\\npilots coming to our training centre for training\\nprefer very often to use models instead of\\ncomputer simulation. Every driver\\'s\\ninstinct in me is going, \"I can just slam it in reverse.\\nTake it \\'round, it\\'ll be fine.\" No, it won\\'t.\\nThat\\'s not how this works. Collisions really occur\\nat our training centre. The main difference regarding\\ncomputers and our models is in computers,\\nin case of problems, you can switch off everything, and you can restart\\neverything. That\\'s okay. In the case of our\\ntraining centre, the only one thing\\nto do is to... call technical staff\\nfor rescue tugs. And quite often,\\nour models are sent directly from the training\\ncentre to our \"shipyard\" for different repairing works. And this psychological\\neffect influences very much the\\nlevel of education. People realise everything\\na little bit differently when comparing with\\ncomputer simulators. Alright, we are home.\\n(sighs) That was a privilege.\\nThank you very, very much. I know very few\\npeople get to do that. You\\'re welcome, no problem.\\nSo thank you so much. Here, every\\ninstructor can do that (laughs)\\n...very easily. [Caption+ by JS*\\ncaption.plus | @caption_plus] There is one thing\\nI forgot to ask. Can I push the whistle\\nbutton, please?

       " \"What's up everybody I'm Alex aka Alex\\nThe Vagabond you're watching Vagabrothers and right now I am in\\nPoland in Warmia and Masuria a beautiful Lake District in the northern\\npart of the county. I'm here exploring with the polish tourism organization and I am extremely excited to explore this country that I've never been to. Marko has taken a vacation back in California so I'm bringing my fiance Carrie Rad\\nalong for the ride. Let's go! All right everybody well welcome to\\nLidzbark Warminski This city was once the\\ncapital of the region of Warmia It was founded in the mid-1300s and this is the castle of the Bishop. It was ruled by a Bishop,  the Bishop of Warmia for over 500 years until the mid-1800s The castle was built\\nin the Gothic style but this was the private chapel for the Bishop and the\\npeople who lived in the castle and it was redecorated in the mid 1700s in the\\nRococo style which is just ostentatious and elaborate and luxurious and to be\\nhonest I have never been in a house of worship as beautifully decorated as this. Also, fun fact if you're coming to Poland and you want to get married you can rent\\nthis place This is the most stunning Catholic\\nChurch I have ever been in in my life it's definitely a nostalgic feeling\\nbeing in here I grew up In Catholic school so I went to Mass every single\\nFriday when I was young and it's just beyond anything I have ever seen before\\nit is so decadent and just stunning gold trimming on absolutely everything and it\\njust feels really a peaceful in here I think my mom would really love this\\nplace So we've left the town of Lidzbark Warminski and we have come here to the palace of Galiny which is not\\nonly a palace, it's also a farm it's also a restaurant which has won some awards\\nfor their cuisine We're starting things off with some polish dumplings and a nice spring salad most of which grown here on the property but we didn't just\\ncome here to eat we're here to learn how to ride horses now it's not the first\\ntime that we've ridden horses but let's be honest how often do you get the\\nchance to polish up your equestrian skills probably not that often so we're\\ngonna ride some horses but first, it's time to eat. How do I say cheers in\\nPolish? Riding horses is by no means a simple\\nthing these beautiful beasts are sentient they know what we're doing they\\nknow what we're not doing and when you do not have equestrian skills like\\nmyself it can become quite a challenge The trot, especially difficult but once\\nyou figure it out once you get your practice going and you have a great\\nhorse it starts to flow a little bit let's go I'm not gonna lie it has been quite a\\nlong time since I was last on a horse when I was growing up I loved horses so\\nthank you to Palac Galiny for allowing me to kind of relive that thank you to\\nAlabama for being such a good girl and and teaching me the ropes again quite\\nliterally. In this modern world that we live in, we lose connection with natural pace you know everybody talks about how many horsepower are in their cars or in\\na motorcycle but this is the original horsepower it's only one but it's great\\nand trust me it is the most powerful experience in the natural world I think\\nthat these animals along with dogs Two the best most loyal creatures As much as I would love to ride Alabama to the next destination unfortunately that's not\\nquite possible so I'm gonna take you back to the barn all right babe let's go\\ncome on let's go Alabama. well it doesn't get much more\\nquintessentially rural than this we are on a horse-drawn carriage going through\\nthe Polish countryside here at Palace Galiny, they have over 350 hectares of land there are farms there's rolling grass\\nyou can ride horses you can hike you can ride bikes you can also stay here you\\ncould stay at the palace which was built in the 16th century or over at the newer\\naccommodation they have over 60 horses honestly this is really really nice I\\nthink that as people and society continues to urbanize part of a part of\\nour soul is begging to be back in the countryside it feels a million miles\\naway from the city and the hectic city life that most of us live so I'm loving\\nit and I highly recommend if you get a chance you come out and try for yourself Alright well we have made it to a new\\ntown it's called the Mikolajki and it's also on a lake but we are hopping\\non a boat to do things a little bit different it's lunchtime and we're gonna\\nswitch it up we're gonna take a boat to a restaurant\\nin the middle of the lake renowned for its fresh fish each day fishermen bring\\ntheir catches to the restaurant and then you eat it on the water it's gonna be\\nsuper rad let's check it out Once again we are going from one Lake to another via canal I love how the forest just comes like right up to the lakes\\nedge and many of the islands in these lakes are actually nature preserves. Overall I think the most surprising thing about Poland to me is that the\\npeople are really all about enjoying life because we're in an area that is\\nfilled with lakes filled with things to do in the outdoors the locals are all\\nout sailing taking boats around to have lunch and just enjoying the sunshine\\nwe've just been really lucky this trip and I'm loving going from boat to boat\\nand there's really no better place to be with the Sun is out\\nshining like this so I'm enjoying it. We have arrived here to Barca restaurant and it's absolutely beautiful it's a\\nfloating restaurant that you can only get to by boat specializing in\\nfreshwater fish caught from the lake every morning the fishermen bring the fish\\nhere this place is the perfect cherry on top of a nice Polish summer afternoon we\\nhave two different types of Lake fish in front of us with Zander and a Burbot\\nwe've got some french fries and some coleslaw / like pickled cucumbers\\nice-cold beer right on the water. I don't think you could ask for much more, cheers. Well it's been an awesome afternoon on\\nthe water but it's time to hop off the boat and head to our hotel which just so\\nhappens to be right there Wow! Well, ladies and gentlemen, we are putting\\nthe cherry on top of an incredible day we're at the Hotel Mikolajki, a\\nfive-star hotel right on the lake incredible views right out in front of\\nus the city of Mikolajki behind us illuminated by the sunset and I'm just\\nfeeling really happy I'm feeling a ton of gratitude right now coming to a part\\nof Europe that I never even knew existed to a country I had never visited before\\nand getting to do it with my fiancee Carrie this has just been such an incredible experience and I feel even happier that\\nI get to share it with all of you back home so I think it's time for me to put\\nthe camera down be present enjoy this sunset enjoy this\\nmoment and check in with you all tomorrow so have a good night Alright ladies and gentlemen welcome to\\nKosova Gorne, we are at a research facility for the Polish Academy of\\nSciences dedicated to researching the Cervid family. The servant family you may better know as the deer family. There are five different species of Cervids here in Poland and this beautiful place is dedicated to better understanding\\nthose animals so there are over 500 animals on a hundred hectares of land\\nhere and we are going to meet some of the scientists who are dedicating their\\nlives to better understanding these creatures and if we're lucky maybe get\\nsome good Instagram photos.  Let's go! So welcome on the research station of\\nPolish Academy of Sciences this is also a deer farm when you can observe how\\nthese animals behave. This is not typical deer, Gabby,\\nshe's a Red Deer hind. She was hand-raised because of the human activity who\\nstole her from the forest. If I raised her I've also become her mother and I have a  responsibility for her whole life. How are you feeling Carrie? Can I live here with you? It's hard work. I don't care. It's a beautiful thing that you have a connection to her like that What to learn from these animals? They are social and if they are social they are close to us we are also \\nsocial species they are very sad when they are alone they cannot be alone Pretty incredible this is it first for\\nme I've never been this close nor touched a deer but Gabbi super nice. I think that coming here and being able to walk with the deer and hang out with a\\ndeer there's a whole new understanding of these animals and I think that that\\nin itself also just shows how close of a connection we can have with animals and\\nhow we actually are animals as well I think in this modern-day and age with\\ntechnology and cars and airplanes we kind of forget that we are a part of the\\nworld not apart from the world so coming here is just a nice little reminder of\\nthat To be honest I'm pretty sad that this\\ntrip is ending it's kind of a bittersweet ending it's been\\nso fun it's been such an eye-opening experience exploring this corner of\\nEurope one that I had never visited before I had never visited Poland before\\nand Warmia- Masuria,  in particular, has just blown me away I didn't know that\\nthis nature existed here I didn't know that these lakes existed the forests the\\npeople the culture it's all been such a pleasant surprise and one that quite\\nhonestly I'll never forget I've had such a great time exploring Poland with Carrie\\nand getting to share it all with you has just made it that much more meaningful\\nso if you're looking for your next European vacation an off the beaten path\\ndestination then I highly recommend you come and visit Poland and if you can\\nmake it to Warmia and Masuria and follow some of the recommendations that\\nwe gave you in this video So huge thank you to the Polish Tourism Organization for making this trip possible it's been such a great experience if you need more\\ninformation for planning your visit to Poland\\ncheck out their website in the description box of this video if you\\nenjoyed the video you know what to do give it a big thumbs up share it with\\nyour travel buddies hit that subscribe with notifications enabled make sure you\\ncheck out Carrie's channel check out my personal channel as well and as we\\nalways say stay curious keep exploring and we will see you on the road.

       " \"hello everyone my name is clara and together with my friend anya we have created this channel to spread information about international mobility and generally about the topic of living abroad today we are happy to introduce you two of our friends lee and luna who are currently living working and studying in warsaw they are originally from south korea and we have approached them to talk a little bit about their experiences of living in poland but we also talk about some societal aspects such as beauty standards or working culture the interview was recorded in january 22 and we're very happy to finally show it to you guys anyway we hope you enjoyed this interview my name is lee and i'm from south korea i'm currently studying international relations at the university of bursa bachelor i'm 26 in korean age i'm 24 in international you have a different way of measuring the age basically you're one year old when you're born and also every year you're getting one year regardless of your birthday or warning that i just have a lot of negative experiences as well and put it out there you know just in case somebody will really want to know how things actually are great experiences as well i think i met a lot of great people a lot of great places to go to to spend your time with your friends i think it's in general the country to study so hi i'm yuna i'm also from south korea and i'm turning 26 what else i am currently working for international company i arrived october 2020 so it's been less than one and a half years so far how about chile how long are you 18 2018 it's been like almost four years now there's a long story but i'll just keep with the third version you know i'm supposed to study in america right because i went to high school there i actually got accepted to the university i got my student visa then f1 you know i paid all the fees and then the plan just kind of kind of got changed i came to europe for like a month and you know i just decided that it might not be to study in europe as well and the tuition was like 10 times cheaper so you know i just thought it might be more economic not a bad choice because you know i've always wanted to live in europe and i really got experience with this european culture yeah actually that's a good question because whenever i meet and get to know some polish people they're really curious if i had any option like personal option to choose a country for poland specifically the first year like i worked for korean teams under multinational companies they desperately needed korean native that's why i was able to be in poland in my first year long story short i haven't had any choice but after one year i also had another option to relocate and transfer to local polish team i spontaneously decided to transfer i think my second year is my choice my first year not at all honestly i still remember looking at the policy culture for the first time i think i was really impressed it's magnificent in like uh the structure of it how big it is really i think poland is one of the countries which is quite undervalued especially from korean the first impression of russo poland was much above my expectation i really like enjoying living and working here compared to where i have been for my entire life in korea way more developed country than i expected especially itself is really far from their type of poet it's really developed full of like skyscrapers it's very advanced city i'd say the old town i think it was um really impressive and you know it was pretty european looking it was nothing like what i've seen before in my life you surprised me which is pretty small and something's very normal to you guys but i was shocked when the door was opening on top like this depending on when you position your uh the doorknob i was like did i break the door food is mainly kind of bland there there's not like certain outstanding tastes that i can feel but you know once i'm used to and know how to enjoy that kind of like blend taste i think i like it and then now probably i will feel kind of awkward or i will feel korean food will be too much because normally korean food cooks a lot of a lot of spices we're only attracted by very strong peas i think i need to find the balance well my favorite was because they had a lot of meat and you know the sauce was pretty great and tasty like yuna said don't say the food in poland plain but that dish has a lot of flavor to it and also like uh one of those pierogies with cheese in it for the potato and also the the goat cheese that you can get from the christmas market i think they're very stringy when you chew on it the cranberry sauce is quite nice actually i saw the post about how polish people think about polish food what made me interested was general polish people think only like mom's homemade polish food is a real polish but is it correct yes that the food of your mom tastes the best that's for sure oh my gosh yeah purple i'm pretty sure lee also experienced like christmas dinner i mean it was amazing like as you know i was in shock with 12 other quizzes some of the like foods were very casual so that i can easily try in most of polish restaurants in russo but there are also like very unique poison that i've never ever tried i like it but overall they're like blend but i like it don't get me wrong i like blend paste right now for me christmas is kind of like spend with your friends uh your loved ones not with your family so they were just kind of a little boring because i don't like them gatherings you know you gotta be very polite as stuff it wasn't for me we don't really do anything special uh except we have a lot of decorations out in the public but i think we spend it with our friends or you know love homes and then all the restaurants were small everything are open probably it's the peak season most of people especially young generations come out of house they are more willing to spend christmas and celebrate with so many parties and events rather than with family which is not really good at some point i think like christmas in poland like that all the relatives families can reunite under those kind of a small religious procedure with a little bit of praying it's a good you know measure like to reunite all the family members together because in korea we don't have those kind of procedures at all for christmas yeah but we have chuseok and youngjae instead i think my obsession well korean food is kind of high i've got to have it trying all of the korean restaurants wherever i go in poland it's really interesting the restaurants and worse are really nice some of the restaurants are more focusing on the westernized face but yeah so i personally prefer the ones with authentic taste similar so and there are a couple of restaurants we can recommend it taste the same like they would back in south australia because most of the koreans finer and worse like these are owned by koreans so don't really have any complaints korean beauty standard is really really formalized we all know like this is considered beautiful probably younger people are really chasing the standardized beauty how you look good is considered one of the top values in korea which is not really good not really nice but i think it's true and then korean plastic surgery techniques are also the word best yeah i think the korean beauty standard is very standardized you know there's a certain right set of beauty that's gotta fit into the box really strange i think everybody has this charm right um everybody looks different they have their charm but you know i think in korean society a lot of people just want to change their eye into a more standard good-looking eyes i don't think it's very positive thing but in europe i think it's rather more of the personal charm you know western countries including poland i can recognize they have standardized beauty of course compared to the level of standardized it's totally different korea including other asian countries it's like a really firm but in eu or other american countries they also have like their preferences but outside of those standards is also highly acceptable i think it's not about polish people it's more like people in warsaw the cold distant uh hard to really approach yeah that was my stereotype true depends on individual most of the time so you say about warsaw did you experience something different in other cities oh yeah definitely yeah i really love myself postnan frostflow people are very friendly and nice i think i was quite shocked because i lived most of the time in warsaw so i just thought all the poor people were just you know cold and distant and went to the other city they were very hospitable i was really shocked and you know it was really probably the further cities from warsaw they have lack of experiences to meet foreigners they are just really welcoming us they don't hesitate to help us out whenever we ask for direction or something i really feel differences from people outside of warsaw about their hospitality there's not much to do not many events like you go out and buy things are pretty much the same you know um when i realized after one year in poland the smart way that i can enjoy life in poland learning how to enjoy nature most new polls are very sporty they really know how to enjoy a nature go on hiking kayaking in the summer i was born and raised in a city which is really crowded we always always rely on those kind of some entertainment places and some restaurants or fun places to go and pay and have fun there it was kind of challenging especially in the winter i literally don't know how to kill my time i'll say i have a very positive opinion about studying in porn uh the faculty my university they're very professional and nice uh very knowledgeable as well and most of the professors were very helpful when it comes to uh let's say i don't understand a topic they're more than happy to like answer you taking like 20-30 minutes of their time through email in person they're very happy to teach you know and also uh most of them speaks very proficient english that was great that's really nice part of korean university and faculties have to learn from because we are still stick to very very full like hierarchy structure between professor and student even though we paid um kind of high for tuition fee we are really hesitant sometimes we are scared of reaching them out to ask some questions it's never going to be a casual relationship you know most of like asian countries in general they have longer working hours for example starting with nine hours we have less day off also the hierarchy not only from school but also most of the organization hierarchy is a big part that many employees are stressed out work and life balance wise it's literally incomparable one thing i was in culture shock is even my polish pose encouraged me other like teammates to just sign off the computer and then have fun or have time with your family but you know in korea no the longer hour you were you are considered a prestigious employee do you have more chances to promote i would never regret about my decision to come and work in poland because of my work and life balance it's really amazing um it's a shame that i didn't like really learn and understand about the language i mean the cultural part like organically absorbed without much effort as far as we like settle down here but yeah the language part i heard so many stereotypes about the difficulty level of polish so i was kind of scared to even begin but yeah it's always in my mind that i have to do and then like a high tone and the pronunciation itself is really really really hard something that happened that when i was in good dance uh i was in a bar playing some billiard minding my business some guy just came up to me like hit my uh stick and i went up to him like ask him like what's that for maybe i should say sorry and he just got super angry all this friend like gathered around me and i started like shouting slurring and you know i think it's one point i think i heard like go back to your country and also like a police came and they literally didn't do anything so i playing quite disturbing the fact that they don't really care but you know as a person that never been in such country but different culture differences i thought maybe they would give me some of the assistance you know because it's not my country and like i was the victim like i had like complete opposite experience back in turkey like every time i go there people are very friendly they're very helpful so like you know i really uh was really easy for me to like get adjusted to their culture and learn about the coach but since you guys don't really have that i think a lot of international people living in poland doesn't really feel necessary to learn homes for their you know your culture a lot of poor people they ask my friends and me like if you speak any posts yeah they usually say no most of my international friends they don't speak the word of polish because they never got a chance to like make uh close friends or you know like learn about the culture because we're very distant kind of cool so yeah i just always uh the simple kindness is not very hard the more of that i think it'll be better for both partners sorry to hear you've had like openstack uh bad things happen everywhere i think i had that experience in turkey australia america so it's normal but uh yeah this is what i thought about here we'd like to end the interview please remember that those were perspectives of only two people living in poland experiences and impressions will differ from person to person however we find it very interesting to learn about a different point of view how about you please let us know in the comments down below and also remember to say a big thank you to our guests for sharing their time and experiences hopefully see you soon in the dixon\",\n",

       " \"hi guys hi i'm just making this video\\xa0\\nthis document i'm not feeling well i hate them all by myself i hate that on 20th of january\\xa0\\n2022 i started feeling unwell\\xa0\\xa0 at first it was just the cold then the soul\\xa0\\ntreats and then these headaches that won't stop\\xa0\\xa0 the next thing i found myself in an ambulance\\xa0\\nand here was in the hospital funny right\\xa0\\xa0 i probably already read heard about the symptoms\\xa0\\nof kovid i've been sick many times but how i\\xa0\\xa0 felt on this day was nothing compared to\\xa0\\nall the previous sicknesses i've ever had\\xa0\\xa0 now it feels like you have malaria but\\xa0\\na little bit worse than malaria well\\xa0\\xa0 i thought i i thought you're vaccinated…? you\\xa0\\ncan get yes you can yes you can remember we've\\xa0\\xa0 got the delta variant the omicron and all the\\xa0\\nother ones that we don't even know the names yet\\xa0\\xa0 so yes i got covered i live alone so at first\\xa0\\ni was trying to tough it out i had gone to take\\xa0\\xa0 care of a friend was ill and it turned out she\\xa0\\nhad covered and at the time we both didn't know\\xa0\\xa0 and that was how i got covered just in case\\xa0\\nyou're wondering how i contacted this disease\\xa0\\xa0 by the second day after the exposure all\\xa0\\nmy symptoms heightened and the next thing\\xa0\\xa0 i remember was being taken in an ambulance\\xa0\\nisolation my results came in the same night\\xa0\\xa0 and it was positive now the best and worst\\xa0\\nplace to find out your Covid 19 positive\\xa0\\xa0 is in the hospital it's best because you\\xa0\\nwould definitely be hospitalized as you have\\xa0\\xa0 nurses and doctors who can take care of you worse\\xa0\\nbecause you're trapped your isolation will be\\xa0\\xa0 in the coveted world which brings me to the\\xa0\\npsychological effects of isolating in a hospital\\xa0\\xa0 this entire floor is designated for coveted\\xa0\\nisolation now on this floor there are different\\xa0\\xa0 rooms with different patients battling the\\xa0\\ndifferent faces of this virus you can hear them\\xa0\\xa0 struggling to breathe you can hear them\\xa0\\ncrying you can hear people in pain you can\\xa0\\xa0 see some of them strapped to oxygen masks\\xa0\\nbecause they can no longer breathe on their own\\xa0\\xa0 i was rolled into this room and we had two other\\xa0\\nladies an elderly woman and a middle-aged woman\\xa0\\xa0 on my first night here i was too sick to be\\xa0\\nbothered about talking to other people and\\xa0\\xa0 getting to know what was going on i was so sick\\xa0\\nto even be bothered about being bored but by the\\xa0\\xa0 next couple of days i realized i was in for a\\xa0\\nride the only human contact i got was either\\xa0\\xa0 with nurses doctors or cleaners and they came in\\xa0\\ncompletely covered up in covid protection suits\\xa0\\xa0 the other contact we got with directly unprotected\\xa0\\ncontacts with other patients so so far as you had\\xa0\\xa0 copied you didn't need to wear masks in this\\xa0\\nroom and we could interact with each other\\xa0\\xa0 now with daily iv drips of antibiotics blood\\xa0\\nthinner injections on my stomach vitamins\\xa0\\xa0 pills temperature on pulse checks three to\\xa0\\nfour times a day and occasionally the nurses\\xa0\\xa0 would come around and try to gist with us that\\xa0\\nwas the only thing all we could do was look and\\xa0\\xa0 see how life was going on outside through\\xa0\\nthe windows we weren't even allowed to open\\xa0\\xa0 the windows completely only to get air and only\\xa0\\nthe top compartment of the window would be open\\xa0\\xa0 i stood here and i looked outside and i could\\xa0\\nsee my building from here so so sad that i was\\xa0\\xa0 so close to home yet i couldn't go home i felt\\xa0\\ntrapped this hospital was killing me as every day\\xa0\\xa0 passed ego was my mental health was depreciating\\xa0\\nlet's talk about the food the hospital food where\\xa0\\xa0 do i begin tasteless bland repetitive these\\xa0\\nare some adjectives to describe this food by day three i couldn't take it\\xa0\\nanymore i would cry for no reason\\xa0\\xa0 i felt trapped everything was just wrong my\\xa0\\nparents were so worried but i kept on acting\\xa0\\xa0 like always well with me meanwhile i was\\xa0\\nsinking emotionally i felt caged my veins\\xa0\\xa0 were starting to collapse from consistent\\xa0\\niv drips and injections i noticed my hands\\xa0\\xa0 started to swell and i was in so much pain so\\xa0\\ni called the nurses for help to take out the iv yeah my first four nights were horrible when it\\xa0\\ncame to my symptoms everything was wrong sometimes\\xa0\\xa0 i would feel better and then other times i would\\xa0\\nhave this burning up fever sometimes i would be\\xa0\\xa0 able to breathe other times i'm coughing and i'm\\xa0\\nsore and i'm struggling to breathe everything was\\xa0\\xa0 just going south i also noticed a similar trend\\xa0\\nwith other patients because most nights a lot of\\xa0\\xa0 people would be feverish and the nurses would have\\xa0\\nto come to attend to all of us one after the other\\xa0\\xa0 on one of these nights the older lady in\\xa0\\nthe room had spent the whole day crying\\xa0\\xa0 i sat on my bed and i didn't know how to help her\\xa0\\xa0 i rolled over and got to hers she didn't speak any\\xa0\\nenglish so i tried to ask her what was wrong with\\xa0\\xa0 her communication was a big problem so i decided\\xa0\\nto pull out google translate on my phone and we\\xa0\\xa0 began conversing that was when she told me that\\xa0\\nshe had been in isolation for 19 days and she was\\xa0\\xa0 losing it mentally she told me she couldn't take\\xa0\\nit anymore and she couldn't she would rather die\\xa0\\xa0 i pushed back the tears in my eyes and gave her\\xa0\\na big hug i remember staying in the hog for such\\xa0\\xa0 a long time i knew she needed the hog so did i i\\xa0\\nthought that everything was going to be all right\\xa0\\xa0 don't worry about this i had this\\xa0\\nbecause my vein collapsed as well\\xa0\\xa0 and it was hurting me so they had to wrap me\\xa0\\nhere it still was a big but it's okay i have okay some days i would decide to take a walk just\\xa0\\naround the world because that's the only place\\xa0\\xa0 we were allowed to even the end\\xa0\\nof it was love to be key okay\\xa0\\xa0 i'll just take a walk around the hallway sit\\xa0\\ndown i dreaded walking past this hallway because\\xa0\\xa0 every time i came out and walked through this\\xa0\\nhallway i would tend to know what is going on\\xa0\\xa0 in other rooms and it always made me feel sad so\\xa0\\nmost of the times i would rather stay in my room\\xa0\\xa0 now if your friends brought some stuff for me like\\xa0\\nchange of clothes and food to the hospital because\\xa0\\xa0 i had coffee that i couldn't have any visitors\\xa0\\nright now they would have to label those items\\xa0\\xa0 and tag them covered and drop them at the\\xa0\\nhospital gate now for us in the coffee words we\\xa0\\xa0 get our deliverables once a day and we get\\xa0\\nit at 8pm so if a family member or a friend\\xa0\\xa0 brought food for you it will sit at the gates\\xa0\\nuntil 8 pm i wish i could explain it all to you\\xa0\\xa0 the gloom the sadness the pain the stories that\\xa0\\ncomes with being in isolation in the hospital\\xa0\\xa0 there's a cloud of depression hovering around\\xa0\\nthere the doctors made it clear that i was\\xa0\\xa0 going to be here for 11 days so by day 6 i\\xa0\\ngot up i decided to find the silver lining i started to feel better physically mentally i was\\xa0\\nstill in a pit but i decided to make a decision\\xa0\\xa0 i took out my camera and started to film\\xa0\\nsome of these videos that you have seen today\\xa0\\xa0 i kept on waiting to hear the magic\\xa0\\nwords “dzisiaj idziesz do domu”\\xa0\\xa0 today you would go home a few days passed and both\\xa0\\nmy roommates got discharged and i was left alone\\xa0\\xa0 i'd like to thank God for netflix on mobile\\xa0\\xa0 at least i watched a couple of series that\\xa0\\nkept me busy while i was losing my mind hey guys i'm so excited the other things\\xa0\\ni'm excited about is let me show you my friend sends me a whole jar of sweet\\xa0\\nthings are you ready so wait and see okay who knew who knew that\\xa0\\xa0 these are the things that would make me happy\\xa0\\ni also forgot to tell you guys i got crocs look at how the little things and what\\xa0\\nare making me

like\\xa0\\nwhen i was in the hospital last when i was\\xa0\\xa0 in the hospital the last couple of days i was\\xa0\\nmostly sleeping during the day and at night i\\xa0\\xa0 would just be awake so i've still not been able\\xa0\\nto get out of that um we are functioning and\\xa0\\xa0 my friends are scared of me i think only one\\xa0\\nperson has actually physically met me since\\xa0\\xa0 i've been out of the hospital and the others\\xa0\\nare like no i'm not i'm not messing up with you\\xa0\\xa0 so yeah i am i'm okay i guess still feel feverish\\xa0\\nfrom time to time so one thing about covid was\\xa0\\xa0 that sometimes you feel okay so it's like a very\\xa0\\nlike this like a sine wave kind of illness i\\xa0\\xa0 don't know how to explain it but sometimes it\\xa0\\nfeels like you're very fine you're in perfect\\xa0\\xa0 conditions and then the next minute you're\\xa0\\nfeeling feverish you're having headaches and\\xa0\\xa0 the next minute you're feeling so tired the next\\xa0\\nminute you're coughing like yesterday night i\\xa0\\xa0 noticed i was coughing again but yeah i was given\\xa0\\nuh this thing to spray my throat so i occasionally\\xa0\\xa0 have to spray it so i really don't know what it\\xa0\\nso i'm just going to experience what it is like\\xa0\\xa0 after you have recovered from kovid um hopefully\\xa0\\ni'll get back to work uh in a couple of

       " \"what's up you guys and welcome back to the\\xa0\\nchannel we have been told by several polish people\\xa0\\xa0 not to come to katowice so if you have been\\xa0\\nfollowing us for long enough you know exactly\\xa0\\xa0 what we did we came to katowice to see what the\\xa0\\ncity has to offer so let's go and explore the city\\xa0\\xa0 so right now i'm sitting directly in front of\\xa0\\nspodek which in polish it translates to spaceship\\xa0\\xa0 and it's an incredibly interesting looking\\xa0\\ndesign for an arena there's also a bunch\\xa0\\xa0 of other things inside the spodek they hold\\xa0\\nplay they hold concerts they have three huge\\xa0\\xa0 car parks in there there's apparently a very\\xa0\\nlarge gym in there as well it seems to have\\xa0\\xa0 quite a little bit of construction going on\\xa0\\naround the outside of it but nonetheless this\\xa0\\xa0 is a very beautiful and very unique building now\\xa0\\ntypically when people think of visiting poland\\xa0\\xa0 especially from a tourist perspective you think\\xa0\\nof places like Gdansk warsaw krakow or maybe even\\xa0\\xa0 zakopane if you're planning on doing a ski trip\\xa0\\nor some hiking or something like that but katowice\\xa0\\xa0 never really makes that list and today we are\\xa0\\nbasically going to be asking the question why\\xa0\\xa0 why is that why has katowice not made\\xa0\\nthe list of typical polish tourist city\\xa0\\xa0 destinations and that's exactly why we came here\\xa0\\nto katowice basically to explore we're going to\\xa0\\xa0 be spending a couple of days wandering around\\xa0\\nand seeing what is really going on in this city this area that we are in at the moment is\\xa0\\nvery interesting because it's kind of a mix of\\xa0\\xa0 different things so you have these like very very\\xa0\\nmodern looking buildings where big consultancy\\xa0\\xa0 and agencies are in um kind of lined with the\\xa0\\nspodek that arena and that luke has been talking\\xa0\\xa0 about in the distance you see a mining tower over\\xa0\\nthere and then you also see quite a bit of like\\xa0\\xa0 flats that like large apartment buildings that\\xa0\\nlook like they were maybe built in like the\\xa0\\xa0 i'd say the 70s or the 80s so it seems to\\xa0\\nbe like a very diverse type of architecture\\xa0\\xa0 but it all comes together and it seems to be very\\xa0\\nnice the city of katowice was actually seized from\\xa0\\xa0 the nazis in 1945 by the soviet army and it\\xa0\\nwas re-declared as being poland and actually\\xa0\\xa0 since 2020 katowice is categorized as a gamma\\xa0\\nmetropolis of globalization and development\\xa0\\xa0 and it seems to be working in the right direction\\xa0\\nto give itself the name as a modern day metropolis\\xa0\\xa0 wow you guys look at the size of these apartments\\xa0\\nhere this one apartment building and i would\\xa0\\xa0 really like to know how many people fit into this\\xa0\\num i'd say there's easily like 300 400 apartments\\xa0\\xa0 in there and in each one of them probably several\\xa0\\npeople so you can calculate yourself how many\\xa0\\xa0 people might live in there just here behind me\\xa0\\nyou can see the contrast of the much much older\\xa0\\xa0 buildings and architecture in comparison to\\xa0\\nthis building over here you have ultra modern\\xa0\\xa0 buildings almost like skyscraper modern day\\xa0\\neuropean architecture mixed in with old 40s 50s\\xa0\\xa0 60s style almost soviet style architecture and\\xa0\\nit just adds a certain type of unique character\\xa0\\xa0 to katowice katowice has quickly become known as\\xa0\\nthe leading cultural city in all of the Silesia\\xa0 Voivodeship and it is known for festivals music\\xa0\\nconcerts and a bunch of other incredible events\\xa0\\xa0 such as the national radio orchestra is actually\\xa0\\nlocated here in katowice as well and right now\\xa0\\xa0 we are on one of the main walking streets and\\xa0\\nshopping areas in the center of katowice and\\xa0\\xa0 you can see that this place is truly thriving\\xa0\\nthere's plenty of people out and about living\\xa0\\xa0 their lives doing their shopping and there's loads\\xa0\\nof amazing local markets to check out as well my god you guys this is so cool\\xa0\\ncheck this out it seems like there is\\xa0\\xa0 a public piano that people or like\\xa0\\nlocals that just walk by can play\\xa0\\xa0 on and there's actually a lot of people\\xa0\\nstopping and clapping and all of that so\\xa0\\xa0 i think that's a really really great idea\\xa0\\nand this grandma here is actually really good\\xa0\\xa0 right now we're in galleria katowicka which is one\\xa0\\nof the many amazing super malls that you will find\\xa0\\xa0 scattered all over katowice again adding an\\xa0\\namazing extra dimension to the city of katowice\\xa0\\xa0 this mall itself is really amazing not only\\xa0\\nbecause of the choice of shops obviously you have\\xa0\\xa0 everything here from a to z that you would find\\xa0\\nin any other larger european city really and this\\xa0\\xa0 mall is also really interesting because of its\\xa0\\narchitecture i kind of feel like it's just hyper\\xa0\\xa0 modern and everything kind of is white and cement\\xa0\\nlike this very hyper modern industrial type of\\xa0\\xa0 a mall which i think makes it look really\\xa0\\ninteresting check this house here out\\xa0\\xa0 where the zhafka is in them it\\xa0\\nliterally looks like a squirrel stream\\xa0\\xa0 and if i was a squirrel i would rent the space\\xa0\\nin there for sure right now we are in the main\\xa0\\xa0 market square of katowice and beautiful modern\\xa0\\nand contemporary buildings surround this beautiful\\xa0\\xa0 plaza it's also crisscrossed with tram lines\\xa0\\nand you can commonly see trams just passing by\\xa0\\xa0 on every side of this plaza square it is a super\\xa0\\nnice laid-back atmosphere here in this plaza\\xa0\\xa0 there's plenty of coffee shops uh outdoor cafes\\xa0\\nthere's beautiful stairs just over here behind me\\xa0\\xa0 where you can see people just chilling and having\\xa0\\ntheir midday lunch and we are lucky once again to\\xa0\\xa0 have beautiful sunshine here with us today as we\\xa0\\nare filming around this amazing city Gesundheit, Danke\\xa0\\xa0 it's quite strange actually the weather\\xa0\\nand the temperature difference between here\\xa0\\xa0 and zakopane we came here on the bus from\\xa0\\nzakopane and it took us yesterday around\\xa0\\xa0 three and a half hours nearly four hours to get\\xa0\\nhere to Katowice obviously there's quite a big\\xa0\\xa0 difference in elevation between the two places\\xa0\\nso you really do feel the temperature difference\\xa0\\xa0 today is a sunny day and we were expecting\\xa0\\nto be a little bit on the chilly side but\\xa0\\xa0 wow it's hot yeah this morning when we were\\xa0\\nin our accommodation i was telling luke to\\xa0\\xa0 put on something warm because he kind of\\xa0\\nhad short sleeve short sleeves and then\\xa0\\xa0 now we are really regretting the decision because\\xa0\\nit's actually so hot that uh i think like a nice\\xa0\\xa0 summery dress or maybe just a t-shirt would have\\xa0\\nbeen enough yeah i definitely am considering it i\\xa0\\xa0 should have brought a hat with me as well i'm\\xa0\\ngonna have a red head for the next few videos\\xa0\\xa0 obviously there are loads of other things that\\xa0\\nkatowice has to offer there's not only malls and\\xa0\\xa0 nice architecture around here there are loads and\\xa0\\nloads of music festivals concerts going on loads\\xa0\\xa0 of museums and art galleries and all of that good\\xa0\\nstuff so i do think katowice is a valid choice if\\xa0\\xa0 you're looking for somewhere to get away maybe for\\xa0\\na weekend do like a nice city trip and get to know\\xa0\\xa0 poland and the silesia area a little bit better\\xa0\\nnow in terms of things that we have on our to-do\\xa0\\xa0 list while we're here in katowice there's quite a\\xa0\\nfew there is the silesian museum which is supposed\\xa0\\xa0 to be an absolutely beautiful interactive museum\\xa0\\nthat teaches you all about the history of silesia\\xa0\\xa0 of course there's also an area that's called\\xa0 Nikiszowiec if i'm pronouncing that correctly\\xa0\\xa0 and it is supposed to be a coal miner settlement\\xa0\\narea of katowice that is a must see while you\\xa0\\xa0 are here now this is the interesting part\\xa0\\nwe're going to be in katowice for a few days\\xa0\\xa0 and we're definitely going to be filming another\\xa0\\nvideo while we're here so hit that red subscribe\\xa0\\xa0 button if you haven't already because we're\\xa0\\ndefinitely going to be going and checking out\\xa0\\xa0 Nikiszowiec so if you want to see that video\\xa0\\nclick away now today is just our very first day\\xa0\\xa0 of wandering around and checking out the sites\\xa0\\nhere in katowice so we are very much totally new\\xa0\\xa0 to this city and we're seeing it with fresh eyes\\xa0\\nso guys this is a question for you drop it down\\xa0\\xa0 in the comments if you can what are the must do\\xa0\\nthings while we are in katowice and you never know\\xa0\\xa0 we may go and pick one of those comments and\\xa0\\nfeature that in the next video here because we are\\xa0\\xa0 anxiously looking for incredible places to see\\xa0\\nthat are a little bit off of the beaten path and\\xa0\\xa0 that's why we came to katowice in the first place\\xa0\\nbecause yes it's nice to go to places such as\\xa0\\xa0 krakow or like zakopane for example but so many\\xa0\\nmillions of tourists have been to these places\\xa0\\xa0 so we are currently on the hunt for the real side\\xa0\\nof poland we want to experience what the locals\\xa0\\xa0 experience so let us know down below so we've been\\xa0\\nhere now for a few hours wandering around these\\xa0\\xa0 beautiful and unique streets check this\\xa0\\nbuilding out beside me it's really interesting\\xa0\\xa0 all of the architecture here actually is super\\xa0\\ninteresting that's like we said it's just a\\xa0\\xa0 total blend of so many different eras and ages all\\xa0\\ncombined into this former coal mining settlement\\xa0\\xa0 of a city so it really just adds a whole different\\xa0\\nperspective to a modern day european west european\\xa0\\xa0 city what's your first impressions of katowice so\\xa0\\nmy first impression i think i am very positively\\xa0\\xa0 surprised because as i said in the very beginning\\xa0\\nof this video people were actually telling us\\xa0\\xa0 not to go to katowice because some people said\\xa0\\nit was maybe boring or not that much to do really\\xa0\\xa0 and i do think it's quite the opposite i\\xa0\\nthink there's loads and loads of things to\\xa0\\xa0 explore here in the area and maybe try out\\xa0\\nsome new restaurants and cafes so i do think\\xa0\\xa0 as i said before it is a valid option if\\xa0\\nyou are looking for like a weekend getaway\\xa0\\xa0 uh like a cultural destination um for like maybe\\xa0\\nthree or four days i'd say yeah definitely and\\xa0\\xa0 uh something that jumps out at me um particularly\\xa0\\nis the amount of greenery that is around this city\\xa0\\xa0 a lot of people described katowice to us as being\\xa0\\nsomewhat of a boring gray dull type of environment\\xa0\\xa0 and the city itself is actually far from that it's\\xa0\\nactually plenty of parks open nature-esque areas\\xa0\\xa0 and a lot of people seem to just be enjoying\\xa0\\nlife here it's not as dull and gray as it was\\xa0\\xa0 previously described to us as being and\\xa0\\nit's definitely surprised me and naomi\\xa0\\xa0 just walking around briefly as we have done\\xa0\\ntoday this is probably going to be a relatively\\xa0\\xa0 quick first impression video but we are very\\xa0\\npositively surprised about katowice and can't wait\\xa0\\xa0 to spend more time here too both thumbs up yeah\\xa0\\nabsolutely so that being said guys that's it from\\xa0\\xa0 us today you guys my name is naomi my name is luke\\xa0\\nwe are the two med explorers we'll see you guys\\xa0\\xa0 in

       " \"I'm on my way to Poland. \\nTo the city of Gdańsk. These days, most people vacationing in Europe are avoiding Eastern Europe because of the\\nwar in Ukraine. Poland borders Ukraine, Belarus, and the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, meaning\\nit's right next door to war and crisis. That scares tourists. But is it justified? I want to check out a city that is usually overrun in summer by\\nvisitors from Germany and Scandinavia. I've booked a city tour with Sebastian, and\\nI blurt out the harsh reality. Sebastian, if I take a look around, there\\nare not that many tourists. Is the tourism in Poland affected by the war in Ukraine?\\nIs that the reason? Yes you have to remember that we have the\\nwar next to our borders, so it has to have an effect on tourism. Especially like the\\nbigger groups, from the States and other parts of the world. The individual tourists are\\ncoming, they are here. But it's not the same what was before. First the pandemic, \\nnow we have the war. All of this things have an effect on our local tourism. What do the people say when they are canceling\\nthe tours? Do they say, the war is too close, it might come over to Poland?\\nIf they can choose, they will choose another If they can choose, they will choose \\nanother destination where there is no risk. That's one point. The second point is that they are afraid of the imagination, that there are\\nplenty of refugees in the streets. Because of the numbers. We have almost 4 million\\npeople who came to Poland from Ukraine. Tourism authorities reiterate that traveling\\nin Poland is just as safe as in Western Europe. But there are still 60 percent fewer foreign\\ntourists and 90 percent fewer group trips. That's hard because every tourist is needed here. The port brought a lot of money into the city.\\nYou can see that here in this street, Ulice Długi, or Long Lane. This is where wealthy\\ncitizens lived. But look what it says up here: 1953. the Second World War. All these houses are new.\\nReconstructed down to the last detail. Only this house here, the Uphagen house, is original. What to do with the ruins in the city? Some\\nideas said it's better to leave it as an open air museum for the next generation, to show\\nthem how the war was cruel. Another idea was to create the new city of Gdańsk for example\\nin Lebniza or New Port district. But finally, they decided \\nto reconstruct the old main town. St. Mary's Church also miraculously survived\\nthe bombing. It's the largest brick church in Europe. Well, that's a cool ferry! A pirate ship. It casts off several times a day and heads\\nto Westerplatte, a peninsula close to Gdańsk. My destination is in sight. Now I'm on Westerplatte, a place with a lot of history. Before World War I, Westerplatte was a seaside resort.\\nThis is where the people of Gdańsk went in summer. A popular destination. But after the First World War, this was no\\nlonger such a peaceful place. Poland built a military depot. And then, on September 1st, 1939, it happened.\\nThe event that changed Europe, indeed the entire world. This is where the first shots of World War II \\nwere fired. Germany invaded Poland. This is the former guard house. It has deliberately\\nbeen preserved as a ruin. 182 Polish soldiers resisted the German invasion for 7 days. Here their names are immortalized. Westerplatte isn't just a historical place.\\nIt's now also a memorial. For the people of Poland, Westerplatte is\\na symbol of resistance against Nazi Germany. And this monument here was erected in honor\\nof the heroes of Westerplatte. WAR NEVER AGAIN it says here. And yet, in\\nthe middle of Europe, there's been war since Russia attacked Ukraine. I think it's really sad. People are losing \\ntheir families, their houses and are migrating to other countries. I hope it\\nstops soon. But I think, the neighboring countries also feel threatened, because we never now\\nwhat is going to happen. We all hope that it's going to stop soon. I look at these photos and I know that a few\\nhundred kilometers away, war is a reality. I hope we will find the strength to learn\\nfrom the past. This place makes me a bit sad. And at\\nthe same time thoughtful. Westerplatte not only reminds us of a terrible war, but also\\nserves as a warning to keep peace in Europe.\",\n",
       " \"[Music] the region of upper silesia feels like a world in and of itself the locals have a unique perspective on history are fighting to declare their vernacular as an official language which indeed is not comprehensible to that of polish and many openly declare they have been defined by the industry of coal mining so today i'm visiting the industrial city of zabja which was first mentioned as far back as the 13th century the city claimed its significance upon noticing shallow veins of coal which were just a small fraction of what was later to be found and considering that what exists at street level here was so greatly defined by what's below i headed to one of the most notorious mines so that i could be at the heart of the region 320 meters inside the earth [Music] when it comes to pullins poland's tourist attractions most people around the world would recognize a handful one of such being the salt mine in vielichka and as that experience is incredible it completely romanticizes the notion of mining when there's a complete flip side to the equation coal mining in more modern times is extremely relevant within the country and although there are less tourist routes available within that vein here in zabja is one of the most incredible underground tours you can take in the country to experience the history of coal mining in silesia the grandness of this antiquated elevator technology is sincerely belittling this heavy duty dangerous equipment could have horrific consequences if ever misused this shaft is 320 meters deep this elevator system is antiquated in some regards but it's perfectly functional and they really uphold the tradition of mining as you'll see the gauge beside me tells the shift operator where the various cages are within the shaft now i asked what would happen if he pushed the lever down a little bit too hard would a cage just pop out of the top you know would it be dangerous apparently following a very tragic accident in the 1960s several automated safety mechanisms are in place to ensure the safety of all who would like to visit the depths of the mine [Music] this bell system is rather elaborate when it comes to the communication between people inside the shaft and the elevator operator not only do they inform which level the elevator needs to descend or ascend but which cages are occupied with human beings therefore the elevator would go to a given level and then unload various levels of the cage now there's one other thing i just observed here as the operator of this level has ascended when he left gave a signal loaded rather promptly into the elevator closing the door and then the elevator gradually went down went up as if the operator was giving a signal to the workers that you guys better be in here you better be safe because i'm about to move this thing the reason being if that mine employee were alone down here loading in there's no one else to give a signal to tell the operator that he is safely aboard so there's kind of a safety mechanism that you really need to be observant of because if you were halfway in the elevator and halfway out when it moved the consequences would be fatal finally it was time to descend into the belly of the mine where my guide would bring me up to speed on the attraction and the local culture guido coal mine in sabja is a very special place in a very special place because inside we can find a huge amount of attractions especially we are touristical objects in former real mind we are 320 even more than 320 meters below the surface in the place where till 1995 miners were normally working we have huge machines we have equipment which is present on the normal mind what's more we can touch it we can see it and we can watch those machines when they are working and we offer you more than 10 kilometers touristical roads under the zabja city in the heart of the silesia [Music] so in good mind you can sight see three levels 170 meters below the surface with the musial historical aspects of mining with the chapel of saint barbara level 320 with the more than three and a half kilometers of touristical way with a lot of machines with a lot of exponents with pure mine and the level 355 about three kilometers of walking in total darkness in very authentical spaces of the mind this mine was established in 1855 with maximum production peaking in 1885 when 312 976 tons of coal was cut decline became noticeable in the 1930s and the mine closed in 1960 by 1967 it was reopened as a test mine for experimental machines now a museum on display you can see a well-preserved horse stable where animals once regarded as luxury items were cared for by dedicated handlers they were said to be so intuitive to their work that they actually internalized the duration of their shift there's also a modern chapel here built in the honor of saint barbara who is an important figure to the minors as a patron of a happy death and everything that is dangerous at over 300 meters below ground there is a monorail with about a half kilometer of rail now this is actually a very typical use of communication and transport in minds as the rails flexible can be set up on demand but today i'm going to enjoy it as a tourist one of the big differences here is that uh unlike an amusement park ride you are in real underground elements most of the tourist corridors are watered so there's not dust but when you get a little bit deeper into the cavernous areas of this mine dust starts to flake out everywhere which is a tremendous feeling makes you feel almost as if we're true miner [Music] my next stop was the krulova luisa complex which is very much at the center of zabra's beginnings for many years there was a local legend of the existence of a multi-kilometer long tunnel and forgotten shafts under the city but it wasn't until municipal workers accidentally stumbled upon an overlooked manhole cover that the rediscovery of the complex occurred locals had been searching for this site for years they sought out theoretical access points in basements they surveyed the surface and just by chance it was found fortunately authorities generously invested millions into securing parts of the complex so that now tourists can visit the edit was created in the course of the 8th and 19th century to the water the place and allow miners going deeper with the exploitation of coal apart from that it was also used as a transport route for coal which was transported in boats directly from the underground and transported then to gliwitza to the ironworks where it was used [Music] this one kilometer boat ride underground is just astonishing this is exactly the type of attraction that you imagine in your wildest dreams as a child the fact that it actually exists and it's accessible it says a lot about the people of zabra who went to a great length to make this a reasonably safe possibility i am mesmerized by the droplets of water by the coolness of the passing stone and if ever you should be passing through this region of poland it's an absolute obligatory stop on your visit [Music] in the times when these waterways were used to transfer coal battery-powered engines were not a possibility as we just enjoyed on the contrary miners had to physically power the boats by hand you can see relics of the handles used to propel the goods forward amazingly this canal stretched through glavitza and ultimately connected to the older river which reaches cities such as vroltswolf and ultimately the baltic sea you could say in a sense that zabja was a port city so here we have an example of what a fully loaded transport boat would look like miners would stand atop these boats holding the handles that i showed you earlier and they'd actually propel the load with the use of their feet now when fully loaded this would weigh somewhere around the neighborhood of eight tons so it was a very slow and methodical process to say the least what my tourist exp appearance here are 200 of years of history of mining because we are here visiting one of the oldest the coal mines in region also one of the biggest in the history and greatest in the history which was working for over 207 years but according to some people which is still working because some parts of it are still operating and are still in use [Music] as i ascended from the depths of the historic tour i exited an elevator only to immediately take a staircase down to a comparably modest depth of about 5 meters this is where you can enjoy the underground family route to the untrained eye this educational technical park looks and feels exactly like an authentic mind and yet it is little more than a simulation created so that technical students could become masters of this dangerous profession but in relative safety in many minds around the world narrow gauge railway is an optimal way to transport the laborers around however it has one fault it does not deal well with steep inclines and for that reason in the more modern construction of mines monorails have definitely won but these trains are still a very important asset to the mining industry and therefore we're going to take a nice little ride [Music] when i finally headed back above ground it was already evening and the weather had shifted to a freezing negative 15 degrees celsius the snow was falling having covered so much space for so many hours in a maze of complete isolation even the quiet town of zabzi seemed intense in saying my farewells to the day i noticed that adjacent the mine shaft was a collection of military tanks turning out to be the military technical foundation an impressive exhibit including tracked vehicles armed personnel carriers military trucks rocket launchers and even the t-34 and t-72 tanks used by the polish army in the 20th century despite the painfully cold temperatures they actually offered to take me for a spin zabja is the only place on earth i can think of where one can descend deep underground take a boat ride under the city center pop up and go for a tank ride and for that reason i believe it warrants your visit in the nearest future so until then i am ryan silkesh for poland in [Music] you\",\n",

(Ciara laughs) It\\'s different, sorry - You ever been to Poland? - I\\'ve never been to mainland Europe. - What? Wait. (Dermot laughs) What? - Nice can of Łomza. - Łomza. - Water, malts and hops. The good it\\'s - That\\'s everything you need in a beer. - What you want. - If this wasn\\'t a beautiful looking beer as someone who doesn\\'t\\nreally like beer, to be fair considering it\\'s from a can, It\\'s got quite a sizeable head on it. That\\'s exciting. - Could be cuz called them porter wrong. - Well, is that not, - I\\'m jokin. It looks good, Colin, I love you. It looks good - To me this looks good. - I\\'m not a Lager gal. - Are you not? - Not a lager gal. (Jamie and Callyann laugh) - [Grainne And Sean] (indistinct Polish) - Apologies, Paul, if we got that wrong. - We tried. - Oh my God, I need music playing. (Callyann snaps) We need to go to a festival, we need to be boppin. Oh my gosh, I\\'m so feeling this. - 5.6% and it tastes like that. - Actually yeah it\\'s grown, thank God. That tastes very nice for\\nthe amount of alcohol in it. - It tastes like beer. - I mean, it\\'s fairly inoffensive. - I feel like Jamie and I,\\nwe\\'re getting, we\\'re calling up the guys and the gals. We\\'re meeting up outside the door. We\\'re going to a festival. - Taxis on da way. (indistinct) is down for fuck\\'s sake lads. Jesus, get it together here. - Started us off well, and we\\'re happy. - Look at the smile on my face. That\\'s not fake. It\\'s real. This has done this to me. - That\\'s a real hundred\\npercent genuine Grainne smile. (Grainne laughs) - At a push. This is the kind of thing like\\nyou\\'d find me drinking beer if it was like at a house party, certain time in the morning\\nwhen there\\'s no other alcohol and I\\'m drinking like this from like a Pringles can and\\nhaving like a great time. - I\\'m sorry. You\\'re drinking that from a Pringles can? - Yeah. - So good. This is very good lager. And like I said, I\\'m not a\\nlager drinking person, but I if this was on offering at Irish\\nfestivals, I\\'d go for this. - I get you. You are, your energy, just like, even if I don\\'t\\nlike this where I say, I didn\\'t like this now, now I feel like I like it. Just cuz it\\'s just hard to like, it\\'s like yeah, you\\'re actually right! (Jamie and Callyann laugh) - I didn\\'t notice that. - Actually, I love it. Give me more! - See normally. (Grainne burps) - Oh Jesus, I\\'m sorry. - That was incredible. That\\'s amazing. - Karpackie! - I do know Polish alcohol. - It\\'s Karpackie. - It\\'s 9%. - 9% Karpackie. Oh my god. - In big red letters. - Oh 9%. We\\'re not killin ourselves. - Oh Karpackie. - [Cameraman] The first result was a beer review blog\\nthat said Karpackie, which is rough pronunciation, Karpackie. - Karpackie, oh beautiful - Karpackie. - [Cameraman] Otherwise\\npronounce it the way you werealready going to\\ncuz you\\'re an ignorant English speaker whose idea of culture is drinking cheap beer. - Yeah. - I agree. - He nailed it. (Jamie laughs) - That person knew, I\\'m\\nso happy you read that. - He nailed it. How do you know my soul, what the hell? (Callyann laughs) What happened to ya? - Can you even beer? (Jamie and Callyann laugh) - I feel like I\\'m such a bad\\nmeasuring stick for this, I just look at you and I\\'m\\nlike, what do you think? - I fuckin, I\\'m also a bad\\nmeasuring stick in that I\\'ll put anything down me gullet, do you know what I mean? - That\\'s doesn\\'t taste\\nlike 9% beer at all. Oh my God. - I think you\\'re right. The other one was like sweeter. Member you were like - It had me pumped for a festival. This is the comedown. - There\\'s a bit more\\npersonality going on here. There\\'s a bit more character to it. You know what I mean? But at the same time, this is just making me long to not focus on the drink and to just\\nmindlessly drink it and chat. - It\\'s a little bit metallicy. - That\\'s what it is. It\\'s like a coin. - It tastes like the can. - See I\\'m more of a cider girl. - I love cider. - Yeah. Yeah. - So you know if this was cider, we laughing. - Oh yeah. Yeah. - Laughing 9% cider. - Oh that\\'s dangerous though. - Dangerous. - I think sometimes a good mark of a drink is a drink that\\nallows itself to kind of be in the background and just let\\nyou enjoy what you\\'re doing. - Honestly. Yeah. - D\\'you get that feeling with this? is it just the background kinda feel? - It may just be because\\nit\\'s in a pint glass and there are other people here. I\\'m not just drinking it\\nalone in my underpants. Do you know what I mean? Which I\\'ve been doing for the last year. So - You can be in your underpants. - I already am that\\'s\\nshe\\'s only playing lads, I\\'m already in me underpants. There\\'s nothing going, nothing else. but underpants going on under here. - From the waist down. - I\\'m wearin shoes, but\\nI\\'m not wearing pants. - Oh dear. Oh, it\\'s vodka oh dear. - Now we\\'re talkin. - This is what I was expecting. - Woo! That\\'s so - Now this is fuckin Poland. - Legendary vodka that\\ncombines Polish distillery tradition with technological advancements. - Wyborowa ideal for meetings. I wanna be in the fuckin meeting\\nroom for business meetings. Like I love that energy. - That\\'s fantastic. Well, that\\'s lovely. - It\\'s absolutely fab. - That is absolutely gorgeous. - Oh, that\\'s quite smooth. - That\\'s so smooth. - Where\\'s the bang after? - That was perfectly fine. - Yeah it was great. - It\\'s really smooth. - I\\'m not a huge vodka person but that\\'s fantastic. - There\\'s no - It\\'s a common layer. Wait, hold on. - Where\\'s the burn. - It is definitely\\nsurprisingly easy, taste wise, it\\'s very run of the\\nmill vodka, I think, but - It is sweet though, I think. - Yeah. There\\'s a bit\\nof a sweetness to it. - Tunes of sweetness. - Oh, I really, really like that. - As somebody who doesn\\'t\\nlike vodka that much, what is it about it that you like? - I dunno. I honestly dunno. - You know the way\\nsometimes vodka can taste a little bit paint strippery? - Yes. - It doesn\\'t have that. - It doesn\\'t have that. - Yeah. - I wouldn\\'t be a huge fan of that. - You know, like when you drink a shot of vodka and you go\\n(indistinct) like nothing, - I felt like I\\'d done\\nthe facial expressions. - It was automatic. - We were both automatic. - It was like automatic,\\nand the I was like wait, there was no need for that. - That\\'s cause your brain has\\nbeen trained to do that thing. - I think that may the\\nbest vodka I\\'ve ever had. - Really? I think so. Sorry. I think I, - Well, that\\'s a big statement. - Hold on. You need to react that way again. - Okay. - I think that may be the\\nbest vodka I\\'ve ever had. - What?! (Dermot laughs) - You are the most naturalistic\\nactor I\\'ve ever seen in my life. - Oh no, is it vodka again? Oh, fuck me. - Ghost of the forest spirit. - Love that. - 95. I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever\\ngot 95 on a spelling test. - So I didn\\'t even see what it\\'s called. I just saw it\\'s 95%. - Oh my God. - It\\'s 95%. Holly balls, okay then. - Like, this is no fucking joke. Like this shit. This is no joke Cally. - Poland really like we started\\noff today with a 5.7% beer. We were like - We were like, \"oh Jesus Christ!.\" That\\'s - We went 5.7, 9, 9 40 95. - There\\'s often a lot of old wives tales that if you had like a throat\\ninfection or there was a lot of bacteria that this will,\\nyou know, kill a lot of that. Obviously. I\\'ve tried it, it doesn\\'t work. (Dermot laughs) - Gimme some motivational words of - Jamie, we\\'ve been on a journey. We\\'ve gone to Poland. We\\'ve we\\'ve embraced the culture. This is something we need to do. We want to be accepted\\nby the Polish and Poland. - Will they love us? - They will love us if\\nwe are survive, this - The ghost of the forest spirit is going to take over our bodies. I\\'ll turn into a deer. You\\'ll turn into an\\nowl and it\\'ll be great. - It\\'s gonna be fun. We\\'re gonna have a fun time. (Grainne coughs) (Jamie grimaces) - If the kick was missing\\nfrom the other one it\\'s it\\'s most definitely\\nnot missing from this one. (Dermot coughs) - Wowwee (indistinct). My tone hurts. - Interesting. - Yeah, is it revealing anything\\nto you about your I dunno - About my life I\\'m kind of\\nhaving a epiphany, are you? - Same, yeah. - I need to go outta\\nhere and do more things with my life than I thought I used to. - Fuck there\\'s people\\nI need to apologize to. (Jamie laughs) - Have you ever had\\nPutchy you\\'ve had Putchy - I\\'ve had Putchy, yeah. That\\'s without question. the hardest thing I\\'ve ever drank. - Really? - Oh, holy fuckin footballs. Okay, that was really fuckin oh Jesus. - I\\'m feeling hair just growing right now. Right here on my chest. It\\'s just - Do ya know? - I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever\\nhad a shot like that. - That\\'s strong. That\\'s very strong. (Dermot slams table) - And nothing. Nothing from this one. - It\\'s like a fume and you just have to - It\\'s not like a fume I\\'ve\\nhad, I\\'ve had ones of this of this fuckin level, this\\npercentage that literally evaporated, I didn\\'t even taste anything. That\\'s that was that fuckin lingered. - [Camerama] Do ya feel\\nthe spirit of the forest? - I am inhabited by the\\nspirit of the forest now. Th ghost of the forest is in me. - I\\'m inhabited by a\\nburp that wants to come out that I don\\'t trust. - For 95% for the strongest\\nalcohol that I\\'ve ever tried. - Well done Callyann and Jamie. because the fact that we\\'re kind of like, we\\'re mellow about it. Like I think we handled\\nthat with dignity and grace. - Oh fuckin (Dermot slams shot glass on table) oh, that was (Dermot laughs) - Oh no, I\\'m definitely not sober. - I think you can notice\\nthe energy change here. Like very quickly now\\nas this continues on. Like the alcohol\\'s kind\\nof hitting right now so. We\\'re just like getting philosophy. - Yeah, let\\'s just do another one. Let\\'s just have some DMC. - Yeah turn off the camera,\\nwe\\'ll have a few more Colin. - Are we done? - [Cameraman] Nope. - So guys now that you\\'ve had Eh, yeah sorry, we\\'re done. - Is that it? - [Cameraman] But we still to\\ndo the outro and the thing. - I can drink though, right? - [Cameraman] Sure. (Dermot laughs) - [Cameraman] So guys, now that you\\'ve had a selection of Polish alcohol, whathca think overall? - Fair play Poland. - All I can say is Poland. You definitely didn\\'t come to play. Okay, Poland had a job to do. - You built up to that. - and they, they delivered. - Jamie, for the roulette. - Oh yeah. - That needs to be done\\nfor a try, roulette. (Jamie laughs) That\\'s a try roulette\\ndrink if I was to ever. - I love how we\\'re just\\ncoming up with scheming. (Callyann laughs) - You know what, change\\nthe whole channel, right? I think the try channel\\nshould be a holiday channel and we got to Spain, a\\npizza and Mexico, Cancun. (indistinct) I think we should go now. - Think of something,\\nanything that comes to mind, drinking song, go for it. (Ciara sings indistinctly) (Ciara bangs on table) (Ciara claps) - Like and subscribe.',\n",
       " \"let's explore zakopane\\xa0\\xa0 my voice sounds ridiculous what's up guys welcome\\xa0\\nback to the channel and welcome to beautiful\\xa0\\xa0 zakopane we made our way here from Krakow we're\\xa0\\nhappy to be here we're happy to explore around\\xa0\\xa0 so come along with us as we give you our first\\xa0\\nimpressions of zakopane let's go zakopane is located\\xa0\\xa0 just at the foot of the tatra mountains and in the\\xa0\\nwinter time it is known for being a skiing area so\\xa0\\xa0 like a ski resort type of area and for the summer\\xa0\\ntime it's known for hiking if you want to come to\\xa0\\xa0 zakopane from krakow it's just a quick kind of two\\xa0\\nand a half hour bus drive away and for two people\\xa0\\xa0 we paid seven euro so it was super super cheap and\\xa0\\ndefinitely worth checking out so right now guys we\\xa0\\xa0 are on the main street or the main touristy street\\xa0\\nif you will called krupowki i hope again i'm not\\xa0\\xa0 butchering that pronunciation but we're basically\\xa0\\ngoing for a quick wander around this is our\\xa0\\xa0 first day properly exploring zakopane \\nwe're very excited to check this place out\\xa0\\xa0 this street in particular seems to have mostly\\xa0\\nrestaurants cafes and a bunch of shops and stuff\\xa0\\xa0 like that so if you do want to do some sort of\\xa0\\nretail therapy or whatever this will be the place\\xa0\\xa0 for you to come we're also seeing a lot of people\\xa0\\nwith the mountaineering sticks coming down from\\xa0\\xa0 hiking because we're obviously in the mountains\\xa0\\nhere and we're surrounded by mountains so\\xa0\\xa0 that's a super interesting dynamic you have this\\xa0\\nbeautiful shopping street and then you have hikers\\xa0\\xa0 and people that are kind of out camping and hiking\\xa0\\naround wandering through here as well so it's\\xa0\\xa0 super super nice and it gives you a nice warm cozy\\xa0\\nfeeling i can see why this place is so popular\\xa0\\xa0 during the colder months this pedestrian zone here\\xa0\\nis just super cute and you literally just need to\\xa0\\xa0 look once and you know exactly where you\\xa0\\nare and that you are in the mountains\\xa0\\xa0 a lot of the shop fronts here they have all of the\\xa0\\nwood kind of and it's designed with a lot of love\\xa0\\xa0 and you can really tell like this is a mountain\\xa0\\ntype of area so i suppose the whole idea of this\\xa0\\xa0 first video here in zakopane is just basically\\xa0\\nto show you guys exactly what we're seeing because\\xa0\\xa0 this is really our first day checking out this\\xa0\\nplace and as naomi was saying definitely has that\\xa0\\xa0 sort of mountain-like charm to it we're definitely\\xa0\\nexcited as well to sample some of the food here\\xa0\\xa0 i'm not too sure if the food is going to\\xa0\\nbe so much different than it was in Krakow\\xa0\\xa0 but we're definitely excited to try something\\xa0\\na little bit more on the cozy side when it\\xa0\\xa0 comes to food and we have a lot planned\\xa0\\nwe have a lot of different stuff planned\\xa0\\xa0 throughout the week that we are here in\\xa0\\nzakopane there's so much things to do you have the\\xa0\\xa0 tatra national park you've got the lake morskie oko\\xa0\\nand you have a whole bunch of other things like\\xa0\\xa0 thermal springs as well to check out and some aqua\\xa0\\nparks as well so our list is growing by the second\\xa0\\xa0 ever since we got here our whole itinerary is just\\xa0\\nexpanding and growing and we might even have to\\xa0\\xa0 book some extra time here a week might not be long\\xa0\\nenough for zakopane that's actually what i said\\xa0\\xa0 probably five minutes into being here we only\\xa0\\nbooked a week for this place and i was already\\xa0\\xa0 kind of trying to convince luke to book a second\\xa0\\nweek because this place is very unique and so\\xa0\\xa0 beautiful oh my god check this out guys this is\\xa0\\nprobably the most stereotypically looking subway\\xa0\\xa0 for a mountain if you imagine subway on a mountain\\xa0\\nthis is the picture that you would imagine walking along the main fashion street or\\xa0\\nthe tourist street and we stumbled across\\xa0\\xa0 a very picturesque beautiful looking\\xa0\\nchurch and super interesting i'm not sure\\xa0\\xa0 from which century this is from but it's very\\xa0\\nvery beautiful the weather actually at the moment\\xa0\\xa0 is very interchangeable it's\\xa0\\npretty windy up here so the clouds\\xa0\\xa0 are moving very quickly so if we do have some\\xa0\\nshots here where it's super sunny and super\\xa0\\xa0 nice and then in the next clip it's very overcast\\xa0\\nthat's why um this is all shot on the same day but\\xa0\\xa0 this church is absolutely stunning definitely\\xa0\\ngoing to have to check this place out this church here is absolutely stunning but what i\\xa0\\nthink is really funny is that this church made it\\xa0\\xa0 into this century by accepting donations with visa\\xa0\\nso you can just tap your card here in the church\\xa0\\xa0 in order to give donations to it that's very\\xa0\\nfunny well that church is absolutely stunning\\xa0\\xa0 inside the artwork on the walls and the amount\\xa0\\nof work in general that must have went into the\\xa0\\xa0 construction of that church it's beautiful\\xa0\\nsuper super good feeling as well when you're\\xa0\\xa0 standing in there and there's a couple of people\\xa0\\nin there saying some prayers too and overall very\\xa0\\xa0 interesting placement as well right here in the\\xa0\\ncenter of zakopane so let's let's keep exploring\\xa0\\xa0 and let's go maybe grab a bite to eat in a few\\xa0\\nas well i'm starting to feel a little bit hungry\\xa0\\xa0 because of the Zapiekanka disappointment that we\\xa0\\nhad in the other video we decided to make a quick\\xa0\\xa0 pit stop here at Smaczek Smaczek i believe is how\\xa0\\nyou pronounce it i don't know um but we will show\\xa0\\xa0 you the sign no we got two Zapiekankas luke went\\xa0\\nwith the Diabelska i suppose that's kind of like\\xa0\\xa0 diabolo like a spicy type of zapiekanka and i went\\xa0\\nwith the regionalna because i just thought it would\\xa0\\xa0 be something regional and it kind of looks like\\xa0\\nthere's ham on there and smoked cheese and we\\xa0\\xa0 both went with garlic mayo and ketchup on top okay\\xa0\\nguys so this is actually my very first time trying\\xa0\\xa0 a zapiekanki or a zapiekanka super super excited\\xa0\\ni basically decided to go with garlic sauce and\\xa0\\xa0 some ketchup on my Diabelska zapiekanka so cheers\\xa0\\nguys let's give this a first impression bite oh wow saucy face as always very tasty\\xa0\\nthere's just a little bit of spice in this\\xa0\\xa0 it might take a while for it to kick in but it\\xa0\\nis absolutely delicious the bread is kind of\\xa0\\xa0 toasted so you have that crunch it's nice and\\xa0\\ncheesy very stringy cheese i think it's like a\\xa0\\xa0 mozzarella type of cheese and that meat as well i\\xa0\\nthink on this one there is if you can see it here\\xa0\\xa0 it's kind of almost like a pork bacon pork belly\\xa0\\nmaybe absolutely delicious 10 out of 10 for me let's give the regionalna zapiekanka a try i\\xa0\\nthink zapiekanki is plural and zapiekanka is\\xa0\\xa0 probably singular as far as i understood\\xa0\\nit i know i get so much criticism for\\xa0\\xa0 my interpretation of polish but i'm going to\\xa0\\ncontinue doing it regardless okay here we go wow that cheese it tastes like i suppose it is a kind of smoked\\xa0\\ncheese with some ham slash pork belly on it and\\xa0\\xa0 it looks like there's some mushrooms on\\xa0\\nthere as well very interesting taste and oh yeah if you ever come to poland definitely\\xa0\\ntry zapiekanka this is 10 out of 10 from me\\xa0\\xa0 as well so as naomi was saying in our last\\xa0\\nvideo when we explored kazimierz the jewish\\xa0\\xa0 quarter and Wawel castle we went on a search\\xa0\\nfor some Zapiekanka and we never actually found any\\xa0\\xa0 because we went to the wrong plaza apparently we\\xa0\\nwent to Wolnica plaza when we should have went to\\xa0\\xa0 nowy plaza thanks to you guys down in our comments\\xa0\\nfor letting us know um unfortunately now\\xa0\\xa0 we're all the way out down here in zakopane but\\xa0\\nwe're very very happy that we came across this\\xa0\\xa0 place because wow these guys are delicious\\xa0\\nand i am sure we are going to be gaining\\xa0\\xa0 a whole bunch of weight here in zakopane\\xa0\\nwe're definitely going to have to do a\\xa0\\xa0 little bit of a hike in order to work all\\xa0\\nthese calories off luckily we are blessed\\xa0\\xa0 we are absolutely surrounded by stunning\\xa0\\nmountains and hiking trails all around us our bellies are nice and warm and full of\\xa0\\nzapiekanka so the next thing that we're gonna\\xa0\\xa0 do is go for a nice long walk and explore some\\xa0\\nof these beautiful markets that are decorated all\\xa0\\xa0 throughout zakopane join us let's go markets\\xa0\\nare absolutely amazing we're just literally\\xa0\\xa0 walked into a random area here with a bunch of\\xa0\\nmarket stalls around and you can get a whole\\xa0\\xa0 assortment of different things from\\xa0\\nfridge magnets to antiques all the way to\\xa0\\xa0 polish traditional dresses and it's\\xa0\\njust incredibly interesting just to\\xa0\\xa0 walk around and have a look very unique\\xa0\\nwe've been to quite a lot of markets\\xa0\\xa0 in our time traveling around and we've never\\xa0\\nactually seen one like this check out naomi\\xa0\\xa0 let's get a new head it suits you\\xa0\\nit's cute definitely suits naomi\\xa0\\xa0 let us know down in the comments if that hat suits\\xa0\\nnaomi and you might see it in the next video\\xa0\\xa0 i think it's very warm though for spring slash\\xa0\\nsummer time so maybe a winter type of hat yeah\\xa0\\xa0 and it is definitely getting on the warmer\\xa0\\nside of things here at the moment it is may\\xa0\\xa0 i understand zakopane is very typical for a\\xa0\\nwinter destination but we're happy that we're here\\xa0\\xa0 at the time that we are because it's perfect\\xa0\\nwe're planning on doing quite a lot of hikes\\xa0\\xa0 and checking out the nature that's around us\\xa0\\njust check out this stuff guys in this market\\xa0\\xa0 i'm assuming a lot of the stuff here is\\xa0\\npossibly handmade but very very beautiful\\xa0\\xa0 you can get traditional underwear\\xa0\\nif you want there you go guys for us right now we're basically wandering\\xa0\\naround the center this market stall\\xa0\\xa0 is literally just at the end of the street that\\xa0\\nwe began the vlog in and definitely come\\xa0\\xa0 and check it out if you do get the chance\\xa0\\nwhile you are in zakopane beautiful place houston we have a problem we found\\xa0\\na place that sells helium balloons\\xa0\\xa0 and i think the guy didn't even yeah he\\xa0\\ndidn't even close it he was very well aware\\xa0\\xa0 of what is going to happen to that helium so\\xa0\\ni think luke wants to tell you guys something subscribe to the channel guys welcome to Poland in oh no welcome\\xa0\\nto poland subscribe to the channel let's explore zakopane oh my god on a serious note guys we\\xa0\\nhave a lot more to explore let's go my voice sounds ridiculous we decided to quake it what we decided to take a quick detour on\\xa0\\none of the smaller hills here and you see\\xa0\\xa0 all of these people being super\\xa0\\nprepared with like hiking shoes and\\xa0\\xa0 jackets and backpacks all of that equipment and\\xa0\\nwe are up here on converse chucks and DC's that's a great great success me and naomi are\\xa0\\nactually just talking about this obviously so\\xa0\\xa0 many hiking trails around here and it's absolutely\\xa0\\njaw dropping nature but you do see all these\\xa0\\xa0 people that are buying down in the center\\xa0\\nbuying hundreds of euro worth of hiking gear\\xa0\\xa0 north face all of these types of brands and\\xa0\\nevery hike i've ever gone on i just basically\\xa0\\xa0 picked the flattest pair of shoes that i have i'm\\xa0\\nalways so unprepared but i usually regret that\\xa0\\xa0 decision the next day blisters and etc etc but we found this beautiful little hiking trail\\xa0\\xa0 um as you can see behind me absolutely stunning\\xa0\\neverywhere you look it's amazing snow-capped\\xa0\\xa0 mountains still even though it's may and\\xa0\\nthere's also this cool little train thing\\xa0\\xa0 that carries passengers up to a certain summit so\\xa0\\nwe were looking at maybe taking that but we don't\\xa0\\xa0 want to spend the money on the tickets oh i nearly\\xa0\\nfell um so we're gonna manually make our way up\\xa0\\xa0 as far as we can and try and get a nice view\\xa0\\nfootually not manually footually that's a new word wow guys that was an absolutely stunning\\xa0\\nviewpoint that we stumbled across there we\\xa0\\xa0 managed to get the drone up in the air and\\xa0\\ntake some pretty stunning shots of those\\xa0\\xa0 snow-capped mountains off in the\\xa0\\ndistance and a little bit of the\\xa0\\xa0 central part of zakopane so now we're kind\\xa0\\nof just stumbling back down i'm trying to\\xa0\\xa0 watch my steps here as i'm going down so\\xa0\\ni don't face plant and roll down the hill\\xa0\\xa0 we're gonna make our way back in to the\\xa0\\ncenter have a little bit of a wander around\\xa0\\xa0 show you guys a little bit more of this beautiful\\xa0\\ntown and then who knows come on come on come along so what's your first impressions so far anyways\\xa0\\nof zakopane what do you think i think zakopane is\\xa0\\xa0 absolutely stunning very very beautiful nature if\\xa0\\nyou are into hiking or skiing i think this is the\\xa0\\xa0 place to be for you both of us definitely are i'm\\xa0\\nless of a city person more of a nature person so\\xa0\\xa0 zakopane just seems to be a really really good\\xa0\\nspot for the two of us yeah i couldn't agree more\\xa0\\xa0 zakopane blows both of our minds and even though\\xa0\\nwe've been here now for such a short period of\\xa0\\xa0 time the slovakian guy is trying to kill us with\\xa0\\nhis car yeah this guy here was reversing pulling\\xa0\\xa0 out i don't know what he was doing but yeah\\xa0\\nZakopane really really is a must-see destination\\xa0\\xa0 if you ask us we were obviously we heard about\\xa0\\nthis place a long long time ago i was actually\\xa0\\xa0 here as well when i was much younger i think i\\xa0\\nwas around 15 16 years old so i don't have too\\xa0\\xa0 many strong memories of this place i do remember\\xa0\\nwhen i was here the last time it was freezing cold Zakopane is 100% check it out if you are planning on traveling\\xa0\\nto poland because this is actually a question\\xa0\\xa0 that we've gotten quite a bit is poland currently\\xa0\\nopen yes absolutely fully open there is\\xa0\\xa0 currently absolutely no restrictions in place\\xa0\\nfor you to travel to poland you don't need a\\xa0\\xa0 test you don't need anything so if you're looking\\xa0\\nfor that must visit summer destination and you do\\xa0\\xa0 love yourself a little bit of nature mixed in with\\xa0\\nplenty of shopping and things to do add Zakopane\\xa0\\xa0 to your list as soon as you can um one question\\xa0\\nas well obviously we have a few things planned\\xa0\\xa0 here in the area already but if you do have\\xa0\\nany recommendations make sure to drop them down\\xa0\\xa0 in the comments below because obviously if you\\xa0\\nhave some locals or some polish people that are\\xa0\\xa0 watching these types of videos they usually know\\xa0\\nmore than we stupid tourists do okay you guys that\\xa0\\xa0 was our very first day of exploring here around\\xa0\\nzakopane get ready for a lot of more content from\\xa0\\xa0

       " \"what's up you guys and welcome back to the channel\\xa0\\nthis is a little extra video that we decided to\\xa0\\xa0 do because we received loads of messages from\\xa0\\nyou guys over on instagram asking why we are in\\xa0\\xa0 poland and how safe poland actually is with the\\xa0\\nsituation that is going on next door basically\\xa0\\xa0 how the situation is with refugees and\\xa0\\nimmigrants and all of that obviously we\\xa0\\xa0 have only been in poland for two weeks we're\\xa0\\nnowhere near the border at the moment we're\\xa0\\xa0 in the south of poland actually in krakow and we\\xa0\\njust thought we might give you a little bit of a\\xa0\\xa0 walk and talk type of video just easy going to\\xa0\\nexplain the situation at the moment yep absolutely\\xa0\\xa0 so we've been as naomi said in krakow now for two\\xa0\\nweeks we're coming up actually onto our third week\\xa0\\xa0 in poland tomorrow we're moving to a new town\\xa0\\nthat's further south here in poland and we're\\xa0\\xa0 super excited to check that place out it's a very\\xa0\\ninteresting place but as naomi said you guys have\\xa0\\xa0 been sending over message after message asking us\\xa0\\nwhat the situation is actually like because we are\\xa0\\xa0 well aware obviously of what's happening next door\\xa0\\nit's not that far away you can definitely feel\\xa0\\xa0 energetically here there has been kind of a shift\\xa0\\nin energy people are a little bit on the low side\\xa0\\xa0 vibrationally you can feel it in people they're\\xa0\\na little bit on the fearful side going about\\xa0\\xa0 their daily life and we've been outside\\xa0\\nwalking exploring seeing things around here\\xa0\\xa0 in krakow for quite some time i'm going to turn\\xa0\\nthis around give you guys a little bit of a view\\xa0\\xa0 of what we're walking around in right now this is\\xa0\\njust a neighborhood where we are actually staying\\xa0\\xa0 at here in krakow it's a beautiful place lots of\\xa0\\ngreenery and lots of locals actually around here\\xa0\\xa0 because that's something that i kind of want to\\xa0\\ntouch on here at the start of this video a lot\\xa0\\xa0 of the accommodations here uh in and around all\\xa0\\nover poland actually has gone up in price airbnb\\xa0\\xa0 booking.com all of the typical places that you\\xa0\\nwould book your accommodation they've all gone up\\xa0\\xa0 in price and that's simply to do with the higher\\xa0\\ninflux of people that are coming into the country\\xa0\\xa0 immigration a lot of things a lot of different\\xa0\\nfactors obviously inflation as well is happening\\xa0\\xa0 across all of europe currently at the moment\\xa0\\nso that's obviously going to factor in as well\\xa0\\xa0 in terms of the accommodation costs people raising\\xa0\\ntheir prices like we noticed we were in albania\\xa0\\xa0 not that long ago staying in an airbnb we\\xa0\\nbooked a one month airbnb in a beautiful coastal\\xa0\\xa0 destination in albania and we only played we only\\xa0\\npaid 230 something euro for the entire month here\\xa0\\xa0 in poland we booked two weeks in krakow and we had\\xa0\\nto book a place that was well outside the center\\xa0\\xa0 and we paid a lot more than 230 euro we\\xa0\\npaid around 500 euro for those two weeks so\\xa0\\xa0 double the cost for two weeks less time in the\\xa0\\nplace itself so that gives you an idea guys of the\\xa0\\xa0 cost of living it's definitely going up and i'm\\xa0\\nsure it is probably affecting or starting to\\xa0\\xa0 affect some of the locals here in poland generally\\xa0\\nspeaking though the reason why we wanted to make\\xa0\\xa0 this video this little quick walk and talk video\\xa0\\ni'll turn you guys back around so you can see more\\xa0\\xa0 um poland is as safe as the rest of\\xa0\\neurope and what do i mean by that\\xa0\\xa0 i understand poland is very very close to the\\xa0\\ncurrent situation that's going on next door\\xa0\\xa0 but if that situation does get any worse so if\\xa0\\nthat situation does come across in to poland or if\\xa0\\xa0 the situation does come across into somewhere like\\xa0\\nromania or anywhere that's in the european union\\xa0\\xa0 all of europe is going to be involved\\xa0\\nin that situation so that's what i mean\\xa0\\xa0 poland is right now as of today today is the 18th\\xa0\\nof may 2022 and it is about as safe as the rest\\xa0\\xa0 of europe is so if you're in ireland england\\xa0\\nor sorry england's not a part of europe anymore\\xa0\\xa0 they got away from us ireland spain portugal\\xa0\\nfrance anywhere like that um you're about as safe\\xa0\\xa0 as we are right now walking through poland so\\xa0\\nthink about it very true and um just in terms of\\xa0\\xa0 notable noticeable things maybe in krakow itself\\xa0\\nfirst of all check out this amazing market here\\xa0\\xa0 little look at my local market really cute and\\xa0\\nin terms of noticeable changes maybe that we see\\xa0\\xa0 at the moment here in krakow obviously you do see\\xa0\\na lot of cars that have a ukrainian license plate\\xa0\\xa0 but that really doesn't really change much it\\xa0\\nsays ua instead of pl on the license plate that\\xa0\\xa0 is about the extent of what you see in\\xa0\\nterms of cars you do see a lot of people\\xa0\\xa0 that have suitcases but um to be honest those\\xa0\\npeople could be tourists as well unless you\\xa0\\xa0 walk up to that person listen to the language\\xa0\\nthey're speaking so if you understand ukrainian\\xa0\\xa0 or you know what ukrainians sound like you\\xa0\\nmight know okay these people are ukrainians\\xa0\\xa0 but unless you do that these people might as well\\xa0\\nbe just normal tourists visiting poland you do\\xa0\\xa0 see loads of tourists such as germans italians\\xa0\\nturkish people whatever people from all over\\xa0\\xa0 the eu really visiting poland at the moment\\xa0\\nas well so these people that dog is not happy so you do see loads of tourists around here but\\xa0\\nthey might be refugees or they might just be\\xa0\\xa0 normal tourists visiting the area so unless\\xa0\\nyou actually walk up and ask them you wouldn't\\xa0\\xa0 know the difference really and it doesn't\\xa0\\nreally give you a different feeling about\\xa0\\xa0 the city or the area as well they're just\\xa0\\nnormal people coming from rough times\\xa0\\xa0 absolutely yeah we met a ukrainian guy\\xa0\\nas well when we were in albania and we\\xa0\\xa0 had a beer with him and the situation is\\xa0\\nhorrible that's going it's going on over there\\xa0\\xa0 but there's nothing that we can do about\\xa0\\nit realistically being where we are and\\xa0\\xa0 there's nothing that the people of poland can do\\xa0\\nobviously the polish government can take action\\xa0\\xa0 and if they want the european union can take\\xa0\\naction if they want but that's all up to them\\xa0\\xa0 for us right now and for the people of poland\\xa0\\ni suppose all we can do is keep living exactly\\xa0\\xa0 so if you are sitting at home right now wondering\\xa0\\ncan i visit poland this year to be honest if\\xa0\\xa0 you're from the european union i don't think\\xa0\\nthat it makes that much of a difference if the eu\\xa0\\xa0 decides to get involved uh big time let's\\xa0\\nsay with soldiers and weapons and whatever\\xa0\\xa0 all of the european union will be involved\\xa0\\num and that's not only poland that's going\\xa0\\xa0 to be germany that's going to be sweden\\xa0\\nor denmark or france all of the countries\\xa0\\xa0 really and then everybody is at danger\\xa0\\nit's not only going to be poland per se\\xa0\\xa0 so yeah i do think poland is probably as safe\\xa0\\nright now as all of the eu yeah 100 guys so all these messages all these people\\xa0\\nthat are worrying stuff like that war\\xa0\\xa0 um situations like war economic downturn\\xa0\\nstuff like that it's always going to happen\\xa0\\xa0 at some stage in everybody's life you're going to\\xa0\\nprobably experience it if you're luckily enough\\xa0\\xa0 you won't experience it but all we can do right\\xa0\\nnow is keep living keep exploring keep seeing\\xa0\\xa0 new countries if you do get the chance and\\xa0\\nwe would actually encourage you guys to come\\xa0\\xa0 check out krakow check out the rest of poland if\\xa0\\nyou do get the chance and what i would like to say\\xa0\\xa0 is well if you do come across ukrainians actually\\xa0\\nwalk up to them and try and start a discussion\\xa0\\xa0 like try and start a conversation not necessarily\\xa0\\na discussion um and understand what they feel like\\xa0\\xa0 what the situation is like for them because i do\\xa0\\nfeel like a lot of them might be by themselves for\\xa0\\xa0 example um traveling by themselves and they just\\xa0\\nneed somebody to talk to and not feel alone so\\xa0\\xa0 if you do meet somebody definitely walk up to them\\xa0\\nask if you can help ask if they would just want to\\xa0\\xa0 grab a coffee somewhere and have a conversation\\xa0\\njust to understand really what it is like for them\\xa0\\xa0 and see if you can help maybe definitely guys\\xa0\\nso we're gonna keep this one

       " \"welcome to the incredible city of krakow in\\xa0\\nthis video i'm gonna tell you all the reasons\\xa0\\xa0 why you should definitely come here to krakow\\xa0\\nand what can you expect in this beautiful city\\xa0\\xa0 my name is fonsi and i've been\\xa0\\ntraveling the world solo for 4 years\\xa0\\xa0 i'm here as part of my central european\\xa0\\ntrip and i it's my first time in poland\\xa0\\xa0 this country is nothing like i imagined before\\xa0\\nand i have to say krakow is now one of my favorite\\xa0\\xa0 cities in europe poland is a country that\\xa0\\nhas deep roots on christianity and you know\\xa0\\xa0 there's all sorts of amazing churches here\\xa0\\nin krakow and this is the city of saint mary\\xa0\\xa0 let's start this blog by entering the\\xa0\\nincredible gothic basilica of saint mary\\xa0\\xa0 right on the main square of krakow not too far from the city center and the\\xa0\\nmain square you can find the vowel cathedral\\xa0\\xa0 this behind me are the fortified walls of\\xa0\\nbabel which include the castle of wawel\\xa0\\xa0 and the cathedral of wawel\\xa0\\nwhich is the cathedral of\\xa0\\xa0 krakow it's such an incredible building\\xa0\\nit was built in the 14th century\\xa0\\xa0 the walls of babel are protected by\\xa0\\na giant fire spitting dragon statue this castle and cathedral on top of a hill is in my opinion the most\\xa0\\nbeautiful building in krakow now let's talk about food i'm doing\\xa0\\na blog specifically about this\\xa0\\xa0 if i have posted it you can see it right\\xa0\\nhere but food in poland is just amazing some of my favorite restaurants here in\\xa0\\nkrakow are the pierogarnia krakowiazy\\xa0\\xa0 which is where i tried my first pierogi which\\xa0\\nis this kind of boiled dumplings filled of\\xa0\\xa0 meat apple or all kinds of feelings the Restauracja Polska which is where i tried\\xa0\\nmy first bigos this stew served in this case\\xa0\\xa0 in a giant bread and finally this mysterious\\xa0\\nrestaurant hidden in a library so we we are we\\xa0\\xa0 just entered this library right here in the center\\xa0\\nof krakow to actually go into a restaurant so like\\xa0\\xa0 this is the name of the restaurant and it's\\xa0\\ninside this building which is pretty incredible the best way to move\\xa0\\naround the city center is to go\\xa0\\xa0 by walking or you can use one of these strums\\xa0\\nright here if you want to to go anywhere around\\xa0\\xa0 the cities so walking is a great option trams will\\xa0\\nsave you time if you're going from one uh point to\\xa0\\xa0 the other but all the main sites are here in the\\xa0\\ncenter of the city this is the main square the\\xa0\\xa0 main square of krakow is the center of the life\\xa0\\nin the city it has some of the most incredible\\xa0\\xa0 buildings of the city like the city hall or\\xa0\\nthe sand mary's basilica that we saw before if you're someone that doesn't care about doing\\xa0\\nsomething a little bit touristy but still a lot\\xa0\\xa0 of fun i've seen a lot of couples and families\\xa0\\nride these carriages which look majestic and\\xa0\\xa0 in a medieval town like this one it's just an\\xa0\\nincredible experience for sure and a great way\\xa0\\xa0 to see the city the main square of krakow is\\xa0\\nfull of all kinds of traditional restaurants\\xa0\\xa0 bars and cozy cafes unlike

Poland\\'s post-1945 state was one, that was pretty unrecognizable, from anything that came before it. The most glaring detail was the new Republic\\'s borders. The Soviet Union forcibly annexed the Eastern half of the nation, they had originally invaded in September of 1939. In compensation for this, they awarded Poland the territories of Silesia, Pomerania and Prussia from Germany. Multiples of millions of Poles and Germans were forcibly expelled from their respective homes, in the largest ethnic redistribution in history. [intro] After the war, the infamous Nuremberg trials tried the Nazi leaders for the Holocaust and war crimes, committed on Polish soil. The Soviets escaped similar trials for their own war crimes, since they joined the Allies in the late stages of the war. The Soviet regime would never answer for:\\nthe Katyń massacre of 22,000 Polish officers, the deportation of 1.6 million POWs to Stalin\\'s gulags,\\nor the rape and pillage committed by the Red Army. Poland remained behind the iron curtain,\\nas a puppet state for the Soviet Union. The Soviet regime set up the\\nPolish United Workers\\' Party, a communist party, creating what we\\nnow call the Polish People\\'s Republic. An important Eastern bloc member,\\nand buffer state to the West. The Warsaw pact signed in 1955,\\nas an opposition to NATO, gave the Bolsheviks greater control over Poland\\'s army. The government of pre-war Poland remained in exile in the UK, and was refused to be recognized by Stalin. The Cold War loomed, as both East and West became nuclear powers. The Western allies secretly began talks, of starting a third war to defeat the Soviet Union, called \"Operation Unthinkable\". However, this was abandoned, as nuclear bombs\\nchanged the nature of war completely. The first few years were the most brutal. Land, industry, and infrastructure, was seized by the government. And rather than wealth distribution and prosperity; the resulting brand of socialism simply created a method of resource and value extraction to the Soviet Union. This was called the \"Stalinist Era\",\\nan era characterized by untold poverty. In true Iron Curtain-fashion, Poland stood close\\nto the front lines of a clash of ideology. [\"Vietnamese - we stand with you!\"]\\n[\"Away with Zionists aka. imperialistic agents!\"]\\nThe student strike in 1968 against the regime was brutally suppressed. This decade would also see, \\nwhat remained of Poland\\'s Jewish population, emigrate en masse to Israel,\\nending the Jewish chapter in Polish history. By 1970, the port cities of Gdańsk,\\nGdynia and Szczecin exploded in protests, as these areas were subject to particularly\\nharsh working and living conditions. The government would crack down, and protests\\nwould continue in 1976, and again in 1980, by which point, the government\\nwas 20 billion dollars in debt. Lech Wałęsa started the first workers\\' union, called \"Solidarity\", quickly becoming a political lobbyist group for change. \"Solidarity\" organized the first nationwide workers\\' strike, in 1981. The government tried in vain to enact\\nmartial law, to stop the spread of chaos. However, the winds of change\\nwere upon the Eastern bloc. And in the 1989 election, the communists lost nearly all of the allowable contested seats in Parliament. The wheel began turning, and change was inevitable. The communist party was disbanded,\\nthe Constitution amended, and the centralized control of the economy was abolished. The government in exile was finally allowed to return home. Since then, things have changed pretty drastically. In 1999, the 3rd Polish Republic officially joined NATO,\\nsignaling a huge westward shift in foreign policy. By 2004, they became part of the European Union,\\nhelping stabilize the growing economy. It has been a very long and hard road for Poland. The very center of World War II tensions in Poland had left the nation in rubble, only to be then absorbed into the oppressive regime, of Stalin\\'s communist bloc. A common observation, made by\\nno less than Winston Churchill, is that, while the war had brought an end to totalitarianism and tyranny in Western Europe, in Eastern Europe, it had really only just begun. And sometimes it\\'s important to remember that. Poland\\'s post-communist prosperity, has made it\\none of the Eastern bloc success stories. And who knows? Maybe one day,\\n\"Poland can into space\". Thank you for watching the short\\nconclusion to the story of Poland.

       " \"today we're in the beautiful baltic city of\\xa0\\nGdańsk and we're going to be exploring around\\xa0\\xa0 this stunning place with you guys today so\\xa0\\ncome along with us right now i am in front\\xa0\\xa0 of this beautiful statue of neptune and he is\\xa0\\nlooking pretty heroic if you don't mind me saying\\xa0\\xa0 and it's a beautiful emblem for this incredible\\xa0\\ncity because it does have such an expansive\\xa0\\xa0 maritime history and both of us are very\\xa0\\nexcited to check this place out it's been\\xa0\\xa0 it's been on both of our lists now for quite\\xa0\\nsome time literally since we got to poland we\\xa0\\xa0 were like we need to go and explore the tri-cities\\xa0\\nand a lot of you guys have commented saying that\\xa0\\xa0 we needed to come up here so that's exactly why\\xa0\\nwe're here let's go and explore beautiful Gdańsk so right now we are in Długi Targ where you have\\xa0\\nthe beautiful statue and fountain of neptune and\\xa0\\xa0 this really seems to be one of the main tourist\\xa0\\nattractions here you can hear loads and loads\\xa0\\xa0 of different languages i think we have never\\xa0\\nseen so many tourists and so many english speakers\\xa0\\xa0 german speakers french speakers and so on in\\xa0\\nall of poland so i think Gdańsk is one of the\\xa0\\xa0 most popular cities here in poland and here\\xa0\\nfrom Długi Targ you can have a beautiful view\\xa0\\xa0 onto the old town hall and which at the moment\\xa0\\naccommodates a museum and you can even go\\xa0\\xa0 all the way up to the tower so maybe\\xa0\\nthat's something that we're going to do\\xa0\\xa0 just to get a little bit of\\xa0\\na better overview of the city all right guys so we just got our tickets for\\xa0\\nthe tower in the old city hall of Gdańsk and we're\\xa0\\xa0 going to make our way up now to this tower it\\xa0\\nsupposedly has some of the best views that you can\\xa0\\xa0 get over Gdańsk so let's go and do it literally the\\xa0\\nsecond we made it up to tower and the sun came out\\xa0\\xa0 before it was a little bit cloudy here and there\\xa0\\nbut now it's beautiful sunshine and oh my god let\\xa0\\xa0 me tell you something it's so beautiful up here\\xa0\\nyou can see so incredibly far into the distance\\xa0\\xa0 it kind of feels like you get a whole overview\\xa0\\nof poland basically from here and all you can\\xa0\\xa0 see are those beautiful red tile roofs of the old\\xa0\\ncity itself and you can even see very far into the\\xa0\\xa0 distance kind of the cranes of the port and so on\\xa0\\nso this is definitely a worthy start of the video\\xa0\\xa0 my god the views are just absolutely mind-blowing\\xa0\\ni cannot get over the panoramic 360 views that\\xa0\\xa0 you get when you get towers like this the last\\xa0\\nplace that we had this was in Toruń and it was\\xa0\\xa0 simply spectacular as well this one i think is\\xa0\\na little bit higher than the tower in Toruń\\xa0\\xa0 we definitely had to walk up a whole bunch of\\xa0\\nsteps and we were severely out of breath for quite\\xa0\\xa0 some time but the views are very very much worth\\xa0\\nevery single penny it is around 12 złoty per person\\xa0\\xa0 to get up here for this view and definitely\\xa0\\ndo it if you do get the chance while you're\\xa0\\xa0 here in Gdańsk because it offers a stunning view\\xa0\\ndown over Długi Targ or the long market street\\xa0\\xa0 you can see down very clearly all along the\\xa0\\nstreet you can see the people bustling about\\xa0\\xa0 and it is just absolutely amazing well well well\\xa0\\nworth it from this tower here as well you get this\\xa0\\xa0 stunning view over to saint mary's basilica which\\xa0\\nis the largest red brick church in all of poland\\xa0\\xa0 and as you can see here i even saw some people\\xa0\\non the top of that tower so maybe we can go over\\xa0\\xa0 there and check out that tower as well because it\\xa0\\nseems to be a little bit higher than the one of\\xa0\\xa0 the old town hall but yeah you get this stunning\\xa0\\nview and you can really appreciate how beautiful\\xa0\\xa0 the basilica stands here in Gdańsk the\\xa0\\nstreets of Gdańsk are characterized by this\\xa0\\xa0 beautiful cobblestone walking through these\\xa0\\nstreets you are really reminded of the history\\xa0\\xa0 of this baltic port city a lot of it was sadly\\xa0\\nflattened during world war ii but since then\\xa0\\xa0 obviously a lot of it has been rebuilt to look\\xa0\\nsimilar to the way it did before that war and you\\xa0\\xa0 can see a lot of the history as i said in these\\xa0\\nbeautiful streets we just had a look around saint\\xa0\\xa0 mary's basilica here in Gdańsk and oh my god it's\\xa0\\nso so stunning from the inside it's completely\\xa0\\xa0 white um i think i've never seen that actually in\\xa0\\na church that it's completely white on the inside\\xa0\\xa0 just with like golden accents everywhere so it's\\xa0\\nbeautifully decorated from the inside it looks\\xa0\\xa0 very peaceful very uplifting and you can indeed\\xa0\\ngo up the tower of saint mary's basilica as well\\xa0\\xa0 i believe it was 14 złoty to go up but we just came\\xa0\\ndown the other tower so we don't want to go up\\xa0\\xa0 another 82 meters of staircase and so we're maybe\\xa0\\ngoing to do that later or tomorrow on our own time we just had to take some cash out we just arrived\\xa0\\nto the beautiful river Wisła here in Gdańsk and\\xa0\\xa0 we're gonna go and try and get ourselves a\\xa0\\nboat the boat leaves now in approximately\\xa0\\xa0 five minutes so we should you should be able\\xa0\\nto catch this one stress stress stress stress\\xa0\\xa0 but yeah there's plenty of different types of\\xa0\\nboats that are just floating around have a look but this one over here is the one that\\xa0\\nwe are trying to catch so let's go let's go now if you're coming here\\xa0\\non a day where the weather\\xa0\\xa0 changes quite a bit make sure that you bring\\xa0\\na jacket or maybe even a rain poncho because we\\xa0\\xa0 just got absolutely soaked in rain so so\\xa0\\nwet right now it is just pummeling rain\\xa0\\xa0 out of the sky so we came here this seems to\\xa0\\nbe like an exchange of people getting off and\\xa0\\xa0 on so we came up here to get a seat under the\\xa0\\nroof of the upper deck and thankfully we did\\xa0\\xa0 the seat is still absolutely soaked though but\\xa0\\nit's it's fine it will be good the views all\\xa0\\xa0 along here are just amazing yeah and depending on\\xa0\\nhow full the ship is as well you might not even\\xa0\\xa0 get a place under the roof so that's why we kind\\xa0\\nof got wet for a while because we had to stand\\xa0\\xa0 outside without the roof this this boat as\\xa0\\nwell is it goes from Gdańsk to Westerplatte\\xa0\\xa0 which is kind of where world war ii actually began\\xa0\\nit was the first clash first battle between poland\\xa0\\xa0 and germany in world war ii so crazy amount\\xa0\\nof history and all along here you see so many\\xa0\\xa0 beautiful things like the Gdańsk shipyard where\\xa0\\nthey repair boats coming in and out of Gdańsk it's\\xa0\\xa0 so cool it's amazing so right now you can even see\\xa0\\none of the larger boats that have been for repair\\xa0\\xa0 in Gdańsk being pulled out by several smaller\\xa0\\nboats it kind of looks like maybe three\\xa0\\xa0 or four smaller boats are pulling it out into the\\xa0\\nbaltic sea which is super super interesting to see that boat experience was\\xa0\\none of a kind definitely\\xa0\\xa0 two thumbs up from us it also stopped raining\\xa0\\nthe second we touched ground again so yeah\\xa0\\xa0 literally as soon as the boat trip was over\\xa0\\nit stopped raining but throughout the entire\\xa0\\xa0 throughout the entire trip on the boat itself it\\xa0\\nwas just lashing down really really heavily rain\\xa0\\xa0 so we spent the majority of it trying to look for\\xa0\\ncover on the boat but nonetheless we captured some\\xa0\\xa0 really nice footage for you guys and that boat\\xa0\\ntrip is definitely worth every second now we're\\xa0\\xa0 getting pretty hungry so we're gonna go and\\xa0\\ntry and find a nice restaurant to get some food\\xa0\\xa0 here in beautiful Gdańsk let's go these buildings\\xa0\\nover here are really really interesting looking\\xa0\\xa0 it kind of reminds me and naomi of the\\xa0\\nSpeicherstadt which we saw in hamburg\\xa0\\xa0 not too long ago you'll probably use these\\xa0\\npeople with balloons are everywhere as well\\xa0\\xa0 they have just these giant long strings\\xa0\\nof balloons and me and naomi have been hit\\xa0\\xa0 in the head multiple times we got smacked in the\\xa0\\nface with balloons several times but yeah those\\xa0\\xa0 buildings are really interesting and we went to\\xa0\\nhamburg made like a little bit of a stop over\\xa0\\xa0 there and it looks like the Speicherstadt area in\\xa0\\nhamburg so that's really interesting so we made\\xa0\\xa0 our way into a milk bar it's actually called milk\\xa0\\nbar Stągiewna and it seems to be incredibly popular with\\xa0\\xa0 a lot of polish people around here have a look\\xa0\\naround the restaurant right now it's absolutely\\xa0\\xa0 packed we have no idea what we're going to order\\xa0\\nbut we're just going to pick something at random\\xa0\\xa0 off the menu and then we're going to go and enjoy\\xa0\\nsome food you can find milk bars pretty much all\\xa0\\xa0 over poland and to be honest these are usually our\\xa0\\nfavorite restaurants because you are guaranteed to\\xa0\\xa0 get a pretty large meal for a very small amount of\\xa0\\nmoney just to give you an example we just got two\\xa0\\xa0 kotlet schabowy which is pretty much schnitzel\\xa0\\nwith with some potatoes and dill on the side\\xa0\\xa0 and we paid 48 złoty in total which is like around\\xa0\\n10 euro and for two huge meals which is absolutely\\xa0\\xa0 amazing those two meals were really really tasty\\xa0\\nas well so in case you do come to Gdańsk make sure\\xa0\\xa0 to check out this milk bar here and just to give\\xa0\\nyou a little bit of context with the milk bars as\\xa0\\xa0 far as we understood the milk bars are kind of a\\xa0\\nleftover of communism itself so those were usually\\xa0\\xa0 the types of places where you could get a large\\xa0\\nmeal for a little amount of money right yeah and\\xa0\\xa0 the name itself as far as i'm aware the name milk\\xa0\\nbar comes from cheese curd or cheese leftovers\\xa0\\xa0 and that was because in the times of communism\\xa0\\nmeat itself was very rare and difficult\\xa0\\xa0 to come by and it all kind of ties in together\\xa0\\nthis is exactly why we tried to find ourselves\\xa0\\xa0 a milk bar to visit here in Gdańsk because Gdańsk\\xa0\\nitself was where the fall of communism started in\\xa0\\xa0 poland which is pretty magnificent and yeah milk\\xa0\\nbars perfect place to go if you do want to spend\\xa0\\xa0 just a little bit of money but you want to fill\\xa0\\nup your tummy something that we like to do on\\xa0\\xa0 our channel every now and then as well for you\\xa0\\nguys especially for our polish viewers is to\\xa0\\xa0 give you guys exactly what a certain place looks\\xa0\\nlike during a certain time so we just turn the\\xa0\\xa0 camera around and give you the raw and other feel\\xa0\\nof what the place is currently like at the moment\\xa0\\xa0 and today it is a relatively rainy wednesday\\xa0\\nhere in Gdańsk but we may as well show you guys\\xa0\\xa0 what the beautiful long market or Długi Targ\\xa0\\narea looks like here in Gdańsk so check it out oh we are such children we walked past\\xa0\\nthe sweet factory store called the dansk\\xa0\\xa0 sweet factory and we decided to go in and get\\xa0\\nourselves some pick and mix very first time\\xa0\\xa0 actually we managed to walk past these types\\xa0\\nof stores for one and a half years and today\\xa0\\xa0 was just a day where we were like okay we need\\xa0\\nto go and grab ourselves some candy we gave in initially we were planning on taking you to the\\xa0\\nbaltic sea right now but because the weather is\\xa0\\xa0 only so-so and we made the decision to\\xa0\\ncome to this mall here which is called\\xa0\\xa0 forum check this out they have a little\\xa0\\nriver inside of the mall how cool is that i'm sure however that we will be taking you to\\xa0\\nthe baltic sea in the next two videos because\\xa0\\xa0 one of them is going to be from sopot and the\\xa0\\nother one is going to be from gdynia right yeah\\xa0\\xa0 we are in the tri cities and this is our first\\xa0\\nstop of the tri-cities beautiful Gdańsk and we\\xa0\\xa0 cannot wait to check out the other two that mall\\xa0\\nforum Gdańsk is a really interesting and unique\\xa0\\xa0 mall the architecture in there is just something\\xa0\\nelse and we've never seen a mall like that that\\xa0\\xa0 just has a river cutting through the mall all\\xa0\\nreally interesting and plenty of things to check\\xa0\\xa0 out there we just went in because it started\\xa0\\nraining once again unfortunately the weather\\xa0\\xa0 is not on our side today but speaking of shopping\\xa0\\nGdańsk is known as the amber capital of the baltics\\xa0\\xa0 so there's plenty of places to you can go and get\\xa0\\nyourself beautiful amber souvenirs all over this\\xa0\\xa0 amazing city by the way here in Gdańsk and all over\\xa0\\npoland and the larger cities really you find these\\xa0\\xa0 crazy super malls pretty much everywhere but\\xa0\\nnot only one of them usually several ones of\\xa0\\xa0 them so for example here in Gdańsk we just went to\\xa0\\nthat forum mall but there's also a mall very very\\xa0\\xa0 close to us which i believe is called the galeria\\xa0\\nbałtycka or something like that which is equally\\xa0\\xa0 large like so big that you can genuinely get lost\\xa0\\nin there so in case you do forget something when\\xa0\\xa0 you have when you get to poland there's always the\\xa0\\noption to stock up on stuff that you might need alright guys so great thing to know if you are\\xa0\\ngoing to be coming and staying in Gdańsk there is a\\xa0\\xa0 tram that connects a lot of the city and we are\\xa0\\nstaying in an airbnb that's just outside of Gdańsk\\xa0\\xa0 so that saved us quite a bit of money if you do\\xa0\\nwant to stay directly in the center obviously\\xa0\\xa0 it's going to be a little bit more money so we\\xa0\\nended up getting a place just outside of Gdańsk and\\xa0\\xa0 saved ourselves a good bit so we are just using\\xa0\\nthe tram now to get back to our accommodation\\xa0\\xa0 but yeah this is this was our kind of quick\\xa0\\nfirst impression of Gdańsk city of Gdańsk\\xa0\\xa0 and it is absolutely a beautiful place 100 worth\\xa0\\nvisiting in my personal opinion what do you think\\xa0\\xa0 i couldn't agree more with you i feel\\xa0\\nlike Gdańsk has a very very unique\\xa0\\xa0 charm to it especially the architecture\\xa0\\nand the river itself and even the boat cruise that\\xa0\\xa0 we did today even though the weather was not\\xa0\\ngreat it was an absolutely unique experience\\xa0\\xa0 and i do recommend for you to do that as\\xa0\\nwell even though the weather might be bad\\xa0\\xa0 but yeah guys for now my name is luke my name\\xa0\\nis naomi and we are the two mod explorers and\\xa0\\xa0 this is your reminder to keep exploring i will see\\xa0\\nyou guys in the next video thanks for watching bye\",\n",
       " \"test i'm veronica from welcome home and today i will tell you what you really have to know before coming to poland [Music] these seven things i consider as the basics for the very beginning first of all the documents i know nobody likes them but they are the basics if you are from european union norway iceland liechtenstein or switzerland you don't need any extra documents or permission to come to poland and you can stay here up to three months if you need a visa there are two basic types type c and d type c allows you to stay in poland up to three months and type d up to a year to apply for it go to a polish consulate in your country the usual waiting time is about 15 days but depending on how many people applies for a visa the whole process might take even up to a few months so better don't wait till the last moment i guess many of you are coming to poland because of a new job if so make sure your employer applied for a work permit for you in advance when applying for a visa take this document with you based on this you can get a visa with a permission to work and don't forget that you have to prove that you have enough money to live here and in case of coming back to your country you also have that money once you are already in poland you have to make some documents and permissions but don't worry i'll make a separate video about this later on don't forget about second most important thing health insurance in case of getting any type of visa you will need a travel health insurance a list of approved companies you will find on our government's website of course is in the link below remember that this kind of insurance usually covers only the emergencies and is valid as long as your visa is later on switch to public or private health insurance as a worker on employment or fee for a task contract you will receive a public health care automatically all eo citizens can apply for european health insurance card and get an access to health care in all eu countries just don't forget to apply for it still in your country number three renting a flight you can search on your own on the internet or you can choose an agency just mine that they might have a commission fee i'll talk about renting a flat in a separate video so stay tuned the rental price with utilities is about one thousand water for a room in a short apartment two thousand slotted for a studio or two and a half thousand water for one bedroom apartment of course everything depends on the city and location but these are average and don't forget about the deposit it's one two or three months rent and must be returned to you after the rental lastly the rental time usually a minimum rental time is full year but it's not impossible to find a place for three or six months but just mind that it might be more expensive what else you have to know always sign an agreement and make sure that utilities are included in the rent so you don't have to sign an agreement with providers on your own number four money now let's talk about money poland has its own currency police lotte the ratio is around 3.77 zloty to one us dollar and 4.56 zloty to 1 euro you must know that we really love to pay by card or phone or watch so almost every shop and service point has a terminal even like small local stores or farmers markets seriously don't bring a lot of cash with you it's still in use of course but if you need some cash there are thousands of atms all over the country if you don't want to lose money on currency exchange get yourself a bank account in polish lotte you can do it still in your country just check out a revolut or polish bank where you can open a bank account with a selfie important we don't use personal checks so rather leave them at home as for prices the price for services is cheaper than in other countries of western europe especially for those who are earning euros or us dollars five shopping we can get almost everything here in poland you can buy things from all over the world if not in shops then online so don't bring a lot of stuff with you one more important thing to remember on sundays big malls and supermarkets are closed only small convenient ones can stay open but don't worry we have a lot of them especially our chain japka which is almost everywhere number six language most of us speak english especially young people and those who live in the city some better some words but don't worry we will communicate if you want try learning some basic polish words it will make your life a little bit easier and we will love you for that number seven transport public transport is especially well developed in silesia and metropolis where i live and work but also in other large cities like krakow dynasty and of course in capital poland warsaw but if you would like to have a car go ahead as an eos citizen you can drive here with your own driving license if you are not you have to apply for international driving license still in your country now good news for travelers if you like to visit our largest cities and tourist spots you can easily get there by bus or train it's very convenient we also have a few airports and low cost airlines so getting to largest european cities and countries it's quite easy and not too expensive as for now we have no idea what covert will bring but in general poland is a great base for traveling across europe so take the chance okay it's time to sum up to make your move to poland way easier i made a checklist that you can follow three months before coming to poland get a travel health insurance make sure your company applies for a work permit for you apply for a visa if needed two months before coming to poland start searching for a flat learn some basic polish words one month before coming to poland get a european health insurance card if you are an eu citizen get yourself a polius lotte bank account and debit card book a ticket to paul you can also download the checklist in editable file so you can follow all the steps and even print it if you prefer it's down in the description these are the most important things for now to know before moving to poland it also applies for many other countries in european union which proves that we are quite like our european neighbors and there is no need to worry if you need more information or have any questions leave a comment down below and don't forget to check our website where you will find all the links and important documents mentioned in this video the link is of course in the description stay tuned for our next video moving to katowice residence permit peso and other documents required after coming to poland see you [Music] soon\",\n",

       " \"welcome to Gdynia we are here in this beautiful\\xa0\\npolish port city today exploring around and what\\xa0\\xa0 a better place to be than right here on this\\xa0\\namazing ferris wheel with this beautiful view\\xa0\\xa0 over the amazing port itself let's go and explore\\xa0\\nGdynia come on it's just a little bit windy up here now Gdynia is the third and final city in the\\xa0\\ntri-cities that we are checking out we're actually\\xa0\\xa0 very excited to check this place out we genuinely\\xa0\\nthought that we would only have time to check out\\xa0\\xa0 Gdańsk and just simply because of time restrictions\\xa0\\nand booking on airbnb and stuff is getting a\\xa0\\xa0 little bit expensive obviously it's july and this\\xa0\\nis the go-to summer area destination in poland\\xa0\\xa0 but we are very very happy because all of\\xa0\\nthe tri-cities are very easily accessible\\xa0\\xa0 from train we just basically got the inter-city\\xa0\\ntrain over here and it literally takes just like\\xa0\\xa0 15 to 20 minutes from Gdańsk to get here on the\\xa0\\ntrain very cheap very accessible and check this\\xa0\\xa0 beautiful place out we have nice weather\\xa0\\ntoday thankfully the last few days actually\\xa0\\xa0 over the last week we've been getting a lot\\xa0\\nof summer storms so we've been sitting inside\\xa0\\xa0 pondering about how we're going to get videos out\\xa0\\nbut thankfully the sun is out and it's on our side\\xa0\\xa0 today so let's go and check this place out more\\xa0\\nnow at the moment here in Gdynia you have an event\\xa0\\xa0 going on which is called the sailing weeks so\\xa0\\nthere's loads and loads of people here in the bay\\xa0\\xa0 at the moment sailing on their boats around the\\xa0\\nbay and you have loads and loads of little kind of\\xa0\\xa0 stages all over the harbor really with for example\\xa0\\nmusic there's a fun fair happening and loads and\\xa0\\xa0 loads of things to do so i think it's going to\\xa0\\nbe an amazing day checking out the city of Gdynia Gdynia is one of the youngest of the tri-cities\\xa0\\nso you have Gdańsk sopot and Gdynia and Gdynia is\\xa0\\xa0 the youngest of the three of them and\\xa0\\nit's also the youngest city in all of\\xa0\\xa0 poland which makes it obviously a very modern\\xa0\\ncity nowadays and it is furthermore the main\\xa0\\xa0 port baltic sea port of poland since world\\xa0\\nwar one now there's three beaches that are\\xa0\\xa0 worth talking about here in Gdynia there's\\xa0\\nPlaża Miejska\\n or the main beach of Gdynia there's Plaża\\xa0\\xa0 orłowo which is in the orłowo area which\\xa0\\napparently has some incredible cliffs\\xa0\\xa0 that you can go and check out really wild\\xa0\\nnature there and then there's also Osada Rybacka\\xa0\\xa0 which is supposedly a pretty wild beach area where\\xa0\\nyou can also go and check out pretty conveniently\\xa0\\xa0 i believe from Gdynia now we just spent a few\\xa0\\nminutes wandering around the main beach of Gdynia\\xa0\\xa0 and it is a beautiful place the beach is the beach\\xa0\\nitself is very clean and there's plenty of people\\xa0\\xa0 out enjoying their day here it is a very sunny\\xa0\\nand beautiful saturday afternoon so i can see why right here we have this incredible ship museum\\xa0\\nand it's called Statek-muzeum Dar Pomorza\\xa0 i don't know if i'm pronouncing that one correctly\\xa0\\nbut this is a very interesting ship that has\\xa0\\xa0 certainly been through a lot in history it\\xa0\\nactually circumnavigated around the world\\xa0\\xa0 which took roughly around 12 months for it\\xa0\\nto complete also during world war ii it was\\xa0\\xa0 in stockholm in sweden it was also built in\\xa0\\nhamburg germany and it is a really beautiful\\xa0\\xa0 looking ship for sure and i believe there's\\xa0\\nactually two of these ship museums and\\xa0\\xa0 they are kind of the main pull or the main\\xa0\\nattraction for a lot of people visiting Gdynia\\xa0\\xa0 actually just right next to that ship museum\\xa0\\nthat i just spoke about there's another one right\\xa0\\xa0 here and it appears to be like a destroyer\\xa0\\nship or a ship that carried very a lot of\\xa0\\xa0 artillery a lot of weapons and you can see that\\xa0\\njust at the front they have kind of these like\\xa0\\xa0 turret guns or gatling guns at the front and it\\xa0\\ndoes look like a very strong ship you do not want\\xa0\\xa0 to mess with the people that are on board this\\xa0\\nvessel there definitely seems to be somewhat of a\\xa0\\xa0 torpedo as well on the ship now i have absolutely\\xa0\\nno idea about the history of this particular\\xa0\\xa0 destroyer ship if any of you guys do know please\\xa0\\nlet us know down below in the comments we would\\xa0\\xa0 love to hear more about this but it is very\\xa0\\ninteresting very beautiful looking as well the\\xa0\\xa0 same as the other ship the other ship just appears\\xa0\\nto be quite a bit older but this ship nonetheless\\xa0\\xa0 is very beautiful and it is also painted\\xa0\\nin a pretty interesting color as well\\xa0\\xa0 it is by the way i just read it there you probably\\xa0\\nsaw me in the back and it is the oldest preserved\\xa0\\xa0 destroyer in the entire world so and it was\\xa0\\nactive during world war ii so that's definitely\\xa0\\xa0 very interesting there you go guys learn this is\\xa0\\nwhy travel is the best education in the world and\\xa0\\xa0 this is why we're so grateful to have been able\\xa0\\nto visit the tri-cities here in poland because\\xa0\\xa0 we've learned so much just in the last hour of\\xa0\\nexploring around this amazing port city area being\\xa0\\xa0 here in Gdynia on a busy saturday afternoon with\\xa0\\nthis beautiful weather as well it's truly just\\xa0\\xa0 a good time good vibe everybody's just enjoying\\xa0\\nthemselves there's plenty of different markets and\\xa0\\xa0 things that you can buy souvenirs wise or if you\\xa0\\nneed some stuff for the beach like this stuff here\\xa0\\xa0 you're sorted there's also this big sort\\xa0\\nof get-together as naomi was saying it is\\xa0\\xa0 sailing week so there's plenty of action going\\xa0\\non there's so many different rides that you can\\xa0\\xa0 go on we saw some pretty crazy ones but we kept\\xa0\\nit pretty tame by just taking the ferris wheel\\xa0\\xa0 i have an awful fear of heights so i'm definitely\\xa0\\nnot going on any of the crazy adrenaline ones and\\xa0\\xa0 there's plenty of different places for you to\\xa0\\ngrab a snack or a bite to eat there's literally\\xa0\\xa0 food stalls everywhere and now we're going to make\\xa0\\nour way towards a promenade area just past the\\xa0\\xa0 main beach area i just love hearing the people\\xa0\\nin the back screaming and enjoying their life\\xa0\\xa0 it's so funny good time good vibe\\xa0\\nthat's what i'm getting here from Gdynia\\xa0\\xa0 as always in most of our videos now here\\xa0\\nin poland we're gonna just give you guys\\xa0\\xa0 a real world view of what the\\xa0\\nplace or destination that we're in\\xa0\\xa0 looks like right now so check out beautiful Gdynia\\xa0\\non a saturday afternoon in july here you go guys there's plenty of places that you can go and\\xa0\\ngrab yourself some nice quick fast food snacks\\xa0\\xa0 this fritky place actually there's plenty of\\xa0\\nthose fritky places they seem to be very popular\\xa0\\xa0 see a lot of people eating them at the moment\\xa0\\nfor sure around the beach areas and everywhere all\\xa0\\xa0 over poland you see Gofry yeah those waffles\\xa0\\nso like belgian waffles with like toppings such\\xa0\\xa0 as like ice cream or maybe just cherries or fruit\\xa0\\nor something like that and you see them all over\\xa0\\xa0 poland they seem to be really popular here yeah we\\xa0\\nactually haven't tried one of those yet so let us\\xa0\\xa0 know if they're actually worth trying down in the\\xa0\\ncomments guys but yeah this is what Gdynia looks\\xa0\\xa0 like right now plenty of people out and about\\xa0\\nenjoying their saturday especially this guy here love corgis so right now we are on Kamienna Góra\\n which is a\\xa0\\nvery long panoramic walkway just off of the coast\\xa0\\xa0 here in Gdynia and you can really see loads\\xa0\\nand loads of ships going in and out of the\\xa0\\xa0 main port here in Gdynia but you can also see\\xa0\\nall of the ships that are heading towards\\xa0\\xa0 Gdańsk which is really really cool to see i\\xa0\\nthink it's a little bit of a pity that we were\\xa0\\xa0 so unfortunate with the weather this week and like\\xa0\\nthe entire week that we were here as luke already\\xa0\\xa0 said it has been kind of raining on and off and\\xa0\\neven when it's not raining it is not that warm\\xa0\\xa0 and it has been kind of 20 to maybe 25\\xa0\\ndegrees celsius for the last week so we\\xa0\\xa0 didn't really get the chance to enjoy being\\xa0\\nat the baltic sea and actually go for a swim\\xa0\\xa0 i believe there are probably a lot of people that\\xa0\\ndo go for a swim but for us it was a little bit\\xa0\\xa0 too cold unfortunately now my first impressions\\xa0\\nof Gdynia is that it is a very very laid-back city\\xa0\\xa0 directly here at the baltic sea and i kind of feel\\xa0\\nlike Gdynia has a lot to offer so if you do love\\xa0\\xa0 the ocean and just spend some time by the sea and\\xa0\\nthis is definitely the place for you what i really\\xa0\\xa0 appreciate about Gdynia is that you also have the\\xa0\\noptions to enjoy the city life so you do have\\xa0\\xa0 larger malls and just like the general city here\\xa0\\nas well so it is not only a laid back town by the\\xa0\\xa0 sea you can also enjoy the city life of it what do\\xa0\\nyou think about Gdynia i love it i think it's\\xa0\\xa0 we went and we checked out sopot\\xa0\\njust yesterday actually so you probably\\xa0\\xa0 if you haven't already i hope you've checked\\xa0\\nout our sopot video and our Gdańsk video as well\\xa0\\xa0 this is our third and final tri-city as i said and\\xa0\\nyeah definitely gives off a new modern style vibe\\xa0\\xa0 and when you compare it to places such as Gdańsk\\xa0\\nGdańsk obviously has quite a detailed history and\\xa0\\xa0 you will find quite a lot of historical buildings\\xa0\\nin Gdańsk and what i'm finding is the more sort\\xa0\\xa0 of away from Gdańsk towards sopot towards Gdynia you\\xa0\\nfind less and less history and more modernization\\xa0\\xa0 more sort of buildings that are specifically\\xa0\\ngeared towards tourism and towards you know\\xa0\\xa0 attracting people to come to the baltic sea and to\\xa0\\nenjoy um specific seasons such as the summer now\\xa0\\xa0 and you can see that it's definitely doing its job\\xa0\\nGdynia has certainly attracted a lot of people we're\\xa0\\xa0 hearing a lot of tourists speaking english french\\xa0\\ngerman etc scandinavians as well all over the\\xa0\\xa0 place here and similar we saw the same in sopot so\\xa0\\nthey're definitely doing the right job the tourist\\xa0\\xa0 offices i'm sure are working hard at\\xa0\\npromoting these specific areas and you\\xa0\\xa0 can see what is attracting people here you do\\xa0\\nhave beautiful beaches obviously a lot of the sand\\xa0\\xa0 is sort of put there man-made but the beach\\xa0\\nit's beach itself is impeccably clean the one\\xa0\\xa0 that we saw anyways here in Gdynia for me if i\\xa0\\nwas to pick a favorite out of the tri-cities\\xa0\\xa0 i immediately would pick sopot and that's just\\xa0\\nbeing my honest opinion i would put sopot first\\xa0\\xa0 then next up i would probably put Gdańsk and last\\xa0\\nplace actually would be here there's no specific\\xa0\\xa0 reason for that it's just a general feeling\\xa0\\na general vibe this promenade and everything\\xa0\\xa0 around here is fantastic but i think when you\\xa0\\ncompare it to the history in a place such as Gdańsk\\xa0\\xa0 the things that you can do in Gdańsk and then\\xa0\\nsimilarly in sopot i believe in sopot there is\\xa0\\xa0 just in general it gives off a slightly more\\xa0 attractive vibe for me personally speaking\\xa0\\xa0 let us know what you think what's your favorite\\xa0\\nout of the tri-cities but that is my list what's\\xa0\\xa0 your list my list would probably be Gdańsk\\xa0\\nin number one as well but just because i'm very\\xa0\\xa0 much as you probably know by now into history and\\xa0\\nhistoric architecture so older buildings and stuff\\xa0\\xa0 like that so that's why i put Gdańsk in number one\\xa0\\nnumber two i would probably put Gdynia and number\\xa0\\xa0 three sopot um but Gdynia and sopot are pretty much\\xa0\\non the same level actually for me i just feel like\\xa0\\xa0 a lot of people in sopot kind of have a\\xa0\\nlot of money and it is kind of the place to\\xa0\\xa0 be and if you're more on the affluent side\\xa0\\nin terms of your wallet and if you like\\xa0\\xa0 Gdynia is a little bit more um for regular people\\xa0\\nwhich i feel like makes it very charming yeah 100% so make sure if you haven't already this is\\xa0\\nwhy we're making these videos from poland guys\\xa0\\xa0 a lot of people live in europe and i'm myself\\xa0\\ni'm european naomi european we're both european\\xa0\\xa0 citizens and you get a lot of these typical\\xa0\\ntravel destinations during the summer time\\xa0\\xa0 such as spain and portugal and greece\\xa0\\netc you can the list goes on forever\\xa0\\xa0 but very rarely does any of my family friends\\xa0\\netc acquaintances say they never really say\\xa0\\xa0 oh i'm going to go to the baltic sea in poland for\\xa0\\nthe summer and i suppose why we're making these\\xa0\\xa0 videos is just to give you guys a specific\\xa0\\ninsight into what people like us how we\\xa0\\xa0 would view these specific areas when you're\\xa0\\ncomparing them to other places that we have\\xa0\\xa0 available to us there's a reason why we came to\\xa0\\npoland and that's because we are genuinely curious\\xa0\\xa0 about why not that many other europeans are coming\\xa0\\nhere such as somewhere like spain for example\\xa0\\xa0 but i feel like that's generally a pretty big\\xa0\\ntopic on our channel anyway and we're usually\\xa0\\xa0 trying to go to the places where people would not\\xa0\\nnecessarily pick it as their number one such\\xa0\\xa0 as poland such as albania such as the backlands\\xa0\\nof mexico where we were before and i feel like\\xa0\\xa0 we're just trying to give these places a little\\xa0\\nbit more of exposure and really show you guys what\\xa0\\xa0 these cities have to offer now Gdynia is obviously\\xa0\\na lot more than just a pretty port with some nice\\xa0\\xa0 beautiful beaches there's plenty of shopping that\\xa0\\nyou can do while you're here in Gdynia as well\\xa0\\xa0 and this is one of the main shopping\\xa0\\nstreets called Ulica Świętojańska\\xa0\\xa0 all the way down here you just have rows and\\xa0\\nrows of beautiful shops lots of shopping malls\\xa0\\xa0 and it stretches all the way down here as well we\\xa0\\nactually started the day off in a mall a nice big\\xa0\\xa0 mall and we had ourselves a polish buffet as well\\xa0\\nso don't think that you're going to be short on\\xa0\\xa0 things to do when it comes to shopping etc here\\xa0\\nin Gdynia there's plenty so that was our first\\xa0\\xa0 impressions of Gdynia this station that we're in\\xa0\\nnow the Dworzec it's very old very cool looking\\xa0\\xa0 but yeah that's it from us for today my name is\\xa0\\nluke my name is naomi we are the two mad explorers\\xa0\\xa0 and this is your reminder to keep exploring see\\xa0\\nyou in the next video guys thanks for watching\\xa0\\xa0\",\n",

regular restaurants offer some plant-based dishes to choose from you'll find everything here of course bigger cities have better choices where to eat cheap in poland yes we've got mcdonald's kfc burger king in poland but why eat at a fast food chain when you have a cheap tasty and healthier polish food if you'd like to know what polish home cooking tastes like go to bar literally a milk bar

pierogi or platsky for 15th latte a piece of meat with side dish is 20 plus lotte in a regular restaurant you will pay twice as much of course there is no fancy interior and you order at the bar but it might be a perfect place for a quick and tasty lunch in poland you will also easily buy kebabs french fries and hot dogs they should cost around 10 zloty more or less depending on size but there is one more polish treat on the go you have to try zapikanka according to wikipedia is a toasted open-faced sandwich made of a sliced baguette topped with sauteed mushrooms cheese and ham served hot with

500 milliliter glass dough pivot a small one is normally 300 milliliters the most common type of beer in poland is the classic pale lager and the best known polish brands are teschevitz the price for a big glass of this is around 10 slotted we also have more and more small craft beer brands and multi-tab bars to try them they might be more expensive up to 20 zloty but they are really worth the price poland is a big country with good beers and vodka well yes mostly at old style weddings there are bars selling shots of vodka for five zloty but most young people prefer to meet for something lighter and we do like flavored vodkas especially lemon or chili flavored a polish staple as i said younger generations prefer to media for a cocktail or wine aperol spritz is around 25 and a glass of wine is 15 to 20. is it a lot for someone earning in euro or us dollars well maybe not but drinking out is quite expensive for polls that's why we have already moved up tips payments and other need to knows listen carefully now so we won't make a fappa in a restaurant with a self-service everybody pays for themselves in the restaurant it depends on how we agree and the relationship between

       " \"Have you ever wondered what would happen if\\na bunch of ants fell down a hole into an old Cold War bunker\\nwith no way out? No? Just me? Well, while this sounds a bit like the beginnings\\nof an entomology-themed horror film, it really\\nhappened! And how these ants acted under such extreme circumstances can tell us about what those\\nants do normal– because even trapped in a nightmare, they\\nkept on ant-ing. [♪ INTRO] Allow me to set the scene. It’s the early twenty-tens in Poland, in a long abandoned Soviet bunker that once\\nhoused nuclear missiles during the Cold War. Inside the bunker is a colony of wood ants. Although, I use the word colony loosely here because these ants didn’t choose the bunker\\nlife. This bunker is underground and covered over with trees and dirt as camouflage. Inside, it’s cold, dark, and mostly empty\\nafter being sealed off and made illegal to enter by authorities. Wood ants are pretty common in these forests, and a colony of them happened to build a nest over the top of a vertical ventilation pipe\\nfor the bunker. Over time, the pipe’s metal outlet covering rusted through, leaving a hole. This caused ants from the nest above to fall onto the bunker floor below, with no way of getting back up or out of the\\nbunker. But that didn’t stop the ants from doing\\nwhat they do best: nesting. A team of researchers were tipped off to the\\npresence of this nest and found a way into the bunker. Because what are a few trespassing laws when\\nthere’s science to do? Once inside, the researchers could see these\\nants were building and maintaining a nest, removing\\ndead ants, and depositing them in ant cemeteries far\\nfrom the nest to keep it clean and prevent any potential\\ndisease from spreading. And all of this this is very normal ant behavior. But, the only ants they saw were workers – no queens, drones, or larvae. The constant rain of ants through the ventilation\\npipe was the only thing sustaining the bunker’s\\npopulation. And there was evidence that these ants had\\nbeen at it for years, doing their ant thing under some pretty harsh\\nconditions. But what were they eating down there? Well typically wood ants feed not on wood, but on the waste produced by aphids as they\\nfeed on tree sap. But there’s no aphids in an underground\\nbunker. When the researchers inspected the ants in\\nthe cemeteries, it became clear they had been snacking on\\neach other. Which is not super surprising, given the lack\\nof other available options. Now typically, cannibalizing your friends\\nisn’t something social insects, like ant colonies,\\ndo on the regular. However, wood ants are a known exception to\\nthis rule. Every spring, when various forest colonies\\nare coming out of their winter dormancy period,\\nthey engage in ant wars, killing each other en masse and then feasting\\non the corpses. This establishes colony borders, and provides\\nfood for the victors in the early days of spring\\nwhen food is scarce. Also, I want you to know that “ant wars”\\nis in fact the term used in the published literature. So, snacking on other wood ants is actually\\nnormal! Eating members of the same colony is not that normal until they’re desperate. But, our bunker ants were just doing what\\nthey had to do to survive. And they probably didn’t flinch too much\\nat this choice, considering they’re already predisposed\\nto the behavior. Now, in case you were worried, the researchers\\ndidn’t just finish their research and bounce out of there, leaving the bunker ants to their own devices. Instead, they assembled a vertical boardwalk\\nout of a two by four, to connect the floor with the ventilation\\npipe and give the bunker ants a way to reunite with\\ntheir original colony above. So hopefully, that put an end to it all, at\\nleast for this particular bunker! Now a Cold War bunker full of ants is one\\nof the worst things I can imagine getting someone\\nfor the holidays. Our merch site, dftba.com/scishow, has lots\\nof gifts that are both more portable and less prone\\nto biting. In particular, if you watched this episode\\nand feel in the mood for more incredibly specific animal behaviors, you might like our bucket hat with an orca\\nthat’s wearing its own hat. But! If you want your purchase to arrive anywhere\\nwithin the US by December 24th with standard shipping, you need to order by December 8th, 2023. Now, if you're watching this video in a different\\nyear, it's probably a different date. But if it's this year, then don't forget, December 8th, and don't forget to be awesome. [♪ OUTRO]\",\n",

       " \"Ukraine needs all the help it can get against\\nRussia. And there is one European country that has\\nstepped up in a big way. While major powers such as France, Germany,\\nand Britain have been hesitant to send military aid to Ukraine for various reasons, Poland\\nhas almost single-handedly led the rally for Europe to support the war effort. Without Poland, things may have turned out\\nmuch differently after the first year of fighting in Ukraine, and Vladamir Putin might be looking\\nat victory rather than defeat. The Ukrainian people have shown the world\\njust how strong they are by repelling the initial invasion of their country and pushing\\nRussian forces out of much of their territory. However, Russia still has an advantage. This is not because Putin has the best equipment,\\nskilled soldiers, or brilliant tactics; it’s because the Russian military and population\\nare massive. Vladamir Putin will continue to hire mercenaries\\nand throw conscripts at Ukraine until he can wear them down. The good news for Ukraine is that its greatest\\nally is right next door. Poland might be Ukraine's best hope of winning\\nthe war. Recently, the Polish government has increased\\nmilitary spending to strengthen its forces and has been Ukraine’s biggest advocate\\nsince the war even began. Poland has sent over 1.7 billion dollars worth\\nof weapons and aid to Ukraine since Russia invaded. In fact, Poland is Ukraine’s second-largest\\nweapons provider after the United States. However, Ukraine’s neighbor has done much\\nmore than just delivering tanks, guns, and ammunition. Poland has forced other nations in Europe\\nto send Ukraine help by leading by example. When certain countries needed to be convinced\\nthat they should supply Ukraine with weapons it desperately needed, Poland was the one\\nwho dragged them, kicking and screaming, to do the right thing. Ukraine needs Poland more than perhaps any\\nother ally. And as you’re about to find out, Poland\\nmight be the only thing keeping Ukraine from succumbing to the seemingly endless onslaught\\nof Russian soldiers that are being sent to the front lines. First, let’s look at the direct impact Poland\\nhas had on the war thus far. It’s important to remember that Poland has\\nhad its fair share of disputes with Russia in the past. It wasn’t until the Soviet Union began to\\ncollapse that Poland was able to hold its first free elections in 1990. Up until that point, the Polish people were\\nbeing oppressed by Moscow, which is something they have not been quick to forget. Poland is very aware that if Russia had been\\nsuccessful in taking Ukraine at the beginning of the war, they could’ve been Putin’s\\nnext target. This is why the Polish government was more\\nthan willing to send tanks, weapons, and aid to Ukraine while simultaneously ramping up\\nits own military spending. The future of their nation depended on it. Now that Ukraine has successfully repelled\\nthe initial invasion and is pushing Russia further and further out of its territory,\\nthey need Poland more than ever. It’s estimated that Poland has sent around\\n3 billion dollars in both military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Close to 1.8 billion of that has been military\\naid. In fact, per capita, Poland has exceeded the\\namount of aid the United States has given to Ukraine. So, what types of weapons and vehicles has\\nPoland been sending? Well, if Poland can spare it, they’ve sent\\nit to Ukraine. It’s important to remember that Poland has\\nits own interests at heart and knows that the best way to defend its homeland at this\\nmoment is by making sure Russia doesn’t succeed in taking Ukraine. When the war started, Poland sent Ukraine\\nover 200 T-72 tanks. These are Soviet Era vehicles, but the Ukrainian\\nmilitary needed any tanks they could get their hands on. And as we’ve seen, they’ve made really\\ngood use of them. There is little doubt that without the tanks\\nsent by Poland in the early days of the war, Ukraine would have had a much more difficult\\ntime launching counteroffensives as the war progressed. Tanks are offensive vehicles, and every tank\\nthat Poland has sent to their neighbor has been vital in pushing Russian forces back. Poland has supplemented the tanks they've\\nsent with dozens of BWP-1 infantry fighting vehicles and 122mm BM-21 Grad rocket launchers. On top of armored vehicles, Poland sent a\\nlarge amount of artillery to Ukraine, which would be utilized to defend key positions. The amount of artillery that has been used\\nin the war thus far is staggering. At the height of the conflict, Ukraine was\\nfiring up to 4,000 artillery shells a day, while Russia is estimated to have fired close\\nto 60,000 shells daily. It’s no wonder why Poland had to send Ukraine\\nself-propelled artillery and large amounts of ammunition. Ukraine has also been in desperate need of\\nair defense. It’s been reported that Poland has sent\\naround 100 R-73 air-to-air missiles to help Ukrainian aircraft defend their territory. Another anti-air weapon that Poland has offered\\nto Ukraine is the 160 PPZR Pioruns, a portable air-defense system that is used to shoot down\\nlow-flying planes, helicopters, and UAVs. Poland has also aided in Ukraine's reconnaissance\\nefforts by sending drones such as the WB Electronics FlyEyes to help scout areas and locate enemy\\ntroops. On top of the vehicles, anti-air missiles,\\nand artillery, Poland has also delivered an unknown amount of guns, ammunition, and mortars\\nto Ukraine. Poland wants its neighbor to be able to defend\\nitself, and the Polish government is not afraid to continue sending money and any weapons\\nit can spare. But there’s also another vital role Poland\\nplays in Ukraine’s acquisition of weapons. The close proximity of Poland to the fighting\\nhas allowed it to act as a staging ground for nations that wanted to send weapons and\\nvehicles to Ukraine. Much of the aid coming from across the world\\nis funneled into Poland and then transferred to the Ukrainian military. Poland is also important because it’s where\\nUkrainian soldiers are being trained to use new weapons and vehicles that are being sent\\nby the West. Most recently, reports have been coming out\\nof Poland that Ukrainian troops are being trained on German Leopard II tanks as they\\nprepare to receive these vehicles in the coming weeks and months. It would be a disaster if the weapons reached\\nthe front lines and were useless because Ukrainian soldiers didn’t know how to operate them. This is just another reason why Poland is\\nso vital to the Ukrainian war effort. They have taken it upon themselves to ensure\\nthat when supplies and weapons reach the Ukrainian military, they will have the training to effectively\\nuse the assets to decimate Russian forces. However, perhaps the most important reason\\nthat Ukraine needs Poland in its fight against Russia is not because of what it is sending\\nbut because of what it’s doing on the world stage. At the beginning of the war, NATO members\\nwere hesitant to send too much aid to Ukraine out of fear that Russia might escalate things\\nas a result. As Ukraine continued to claim victories, the\\nwest became a little less hesitant. Poland had advocated for European Powers and\\nthe U.S. to send more military aid to Ukraine from day one. In fact, Ukraine was practically shouting\\nat the top of its lungs that a Russian invasion of Ukraine was imminent, and yet their warnings\\nseemed to fall on deaf ears. The reason Ukraine needs Poland is that they\\nhave been their biggest advocate for a long time now. While other western countries dragged their\\nfeet, Poland sent supplies, weapons, and humanitarian aid. Poland's vital role in the fight against Russia\\nnever seems to end. Even as the war progressed, Poland showed\\nthat it would continue to support Ukraine until Russian forces were pushed out of its\\nterritory. Poland became a leader and set an example\\nfor how other European countries should act. This gave nations on the continent the courage\\nto follow their example. When certain countries still refused to send\\naid to Ukraine, Poland’s resolve led to those nations being guilted into providing\\nsupport that they should have sent a long time ago. Without Poland, there is a chance that the\\naid being sent to Ukraine would still not be enough to adequately supply their troops. It was Polish leaders, in particular, who\\nconvinced the German government to send modern tanks like the Leopard II to Ukraine. Germany was hesitant to commit their tanks\\nto the war effort for far too long. This was for several different reasons, but\\nneedless to say, it was Poland and its actions that helped convince Germany to finally do\\nwhat was right. Even if Germany had gone the other way with\\ntheir decision, Poland threatened to send dozens of their own Leopard IIs in defiance. Along with motivating other countries to send\\nmore military aid to Ukraine, Poland has also been advocating for tougher sanctions on Russia\\nto try and slow its wartime production. The less money Russia has coming in, the better. If Russia doesn’t have the funds to pay\\nfor its mercenaries, factories, and military, it will have a much more difficult time launching\\nan offensive or holding back Ukrainian forces in the coming months. Without the leadership of Poland throughout\\nthe war, Ukraine would be in a more precarious position. Poland has become a powerful voice in the\\nconflict and a main advocate for Ukraine even as Germany and other western powers drag their\\nfeet on sending aid and tightening sanctions. But this is nothing new. Ever since 2004, when Poland joined the European\\nUnion, it warned of the growing threat being posed by Putin’s Russia. The fact of the matter is, Poland has seen\\nit all before. They have dealt with the brutality of a Russian\\ntyrant ruling their country. Yet, these warnings were willfully ignored,\\nand now Ukraine is paying dearly for it. Currently, Poland is one of the countries\\nleading the charge to send F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine to help defend against Russian\\naircraft. At the end of January, Poland even said they\\nwere willing to give the Ukrainian military their F-16s just to provide them with more\\naerial support. However, until NATO agrees to transfer F-16s\\nto Ukraine, Poland cannot legally provide them with the aircraft they desperately need. Even though the jets are currently being held\\nback, it seems that Poland will continue to advocate and fight for sending the weapons\\nand vehicles Ukraine requires to win the war. But besides being Ukraine's biggest ally when\\nit comes to gathering support, Poland is also doing some other miraculous things to aid\\nthe Ukrainian people in their time of need. Poland has accepted more refugees into their\\nborders than any other European country. It’s estimated that there may be as many\\nas 3.5 million Ukrainian refugees in Poland. At the very least, we know there are over\\n1.5 million registered refugees at this point in time. Poland has been leading humanitarian efforts\\nto assist the people of Ukraine just like it has led the charge to send more military\\naid. The refugees in Poland are provided with healthcare,\\neducation, and possible employment, which is amazing when you consider how much money\\nand resources Poland has also sent to the front lines. Without Poland, the Ukrainian people would\\nbe suffering even more than they already are. To be fair, Poland is one of the strongest,\\nwealthiest, and closest countries to Ukraine’s borders, but they have also gone above and\\nbeyond to help the Ukrainian people when it seems like certain nations around the world\\nare doing the bare minimum. And the truth is, as much as Ukraine needs\\nPoland, the rest of Europe needs them as well. Since Poland joined NATO in 1999, it has become\\na key component in the defense of Europe’s eastern borders. Its strategic location is one of the main\\nreasons it’s not only able to aid Ukraine but protect the rest of Europe from Russian\\naggression if things get that far. The nation has also enjoyed massive economic\\ngrowth, allowing Poland to expand its military while improving the lives of its citizens. Without Poland's military and economic growth,\\nEurope would have a lot more to worry about on its eastern front. Obviously, Poland isn’t the only deterrent\\nagainst Russia invading the rest of Europe. The United States' military strength and the\\nnumber of nukes NATO has overall also plays a role in keeping Russia, or any aggressor\\nfor that matter, from invading a nation that is part of the NATO alliance. So, although Poland plays a pivotal role in\\nthe protection of Europe, it’s by no means the only defense Europe has against an invasion\\nfrom the east. Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Poland has enacted\\nplans to increase its military spending to around 3% of its GDP. This means that Poland will be better equipped\\nto protect itself, but it will also be better equipped to aid its NATO allies. And while its military is both vitally important\\nfor supporting Ukraine and the rest of Europe, its politics are just as important for the\\nfuture. It’s alarming how close some European politicians\\nhave become with Moscow. Leaders in both France and Germany have entered\\ninto trade deals, pipeline agreements, and negotiated incentives with the brutal dictator\\nof Russia in the past. Sometimes this was done out of necessity,\\nbut other times agreements between European politicians and Russina businessmen were done\\nsolely for lucrative purposes. No one wants to admit that they’ve made\\ndeals with Vladamir Putin, yet this may explain why certain governments have been so slow\\nto provide aid to Ukraine and increase sanctions on Russia. Poland, on the other hand, has been outspoken\\nabout their disdain for the Russian government and the dangers of entering into agreements\\nwith Putin from day one. Some of the West listened to these warnings;\\nsome didn’t. But it’s no surprise that when peace talks\\ncommenced after the 2014 invasion of Crimea and Eastern Ukraine by Russia, Putin picked\\nGermany and France to participate in the negotiation process. It’s interesting to note that this resulted\\nin the failed Minsk Agreements that obviously did nothing to stop the full-scale invasion\\nof Ukraine by Russia in February of 2022. Ukraine and Poland both know what it was like\\nbeing under the rule of Moscow during the Soviet Era. Although it's been over 30 years since the\\ncollapse of the Soviet Union, people who suffered under the Soviet regime are still around to\\nadvocate against a Russian led eastern Europe. This dark time is still ingrained in the collective\\nconsciousness of the Polish and Ukrainian people, and if nothing else, Putin’s decision\\nto invade Ukraine has brought these two nations closer together. Poland and Ukraine have had their disagreements\\nin the past, but it has become clear since the invasion that Poland is willing to do\\nas much as it possibly can to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty. However, Poland’s hands are tied in some\\naspects of what it can do because of its membership in NATO. If they weren’t bound by NATO doctrine,\\nPoland might have gone much further to stop the Russian onslaught happening to their neighbor. For now, all Poland can do is continue to\\ntake in millions of refugees, send as much aid as possible, and be a persistent advocate\\nfor Ukraine. As the saying goes, the enemy of my enemy\\nis my friend. And Russia is everyone’s enemy right now. Recent polls have shown that the Ukrainian\\ngovernment thought of Poland as their closest partner even before the war. Now that Russia has invaded and Poland seems\\nto be one of the main voices fighting to send support to Ukraine, the nation will likely\\nview Poland as its closest partner in the years to come. Without Poland, there is a very real possibility\\nthat Russia would be in a better position than it is right now. The Ukrainian military and people are definitely\\nthe heroes in this conflict, but without the support of Poland and the numerous roles it’s\\nplaying in the conflict, it’s unclear if Ukraine could have kept Russian forces from\\noverwhelming them. The weapons and aid that Poland has provided\\nhave been incredibly important to the war effort. However, its advocacy for Ukraine and the\\nleadership role it assumed in European politics may be even more vital. It seems clear that as long as Russia continues\\nto wage war, Poland will continue to support Ukraine in any way it can. And even after this conflict is over,it’s\\nalmost a guarantee that Poland will continue to play a pivotal role in NATO’s defensive\\nplans. Poland’s economy and military strength have\\nmade the nation one of the most influential in Europe, and without them, Ukraine would\\nlikely not be able to win the war against Russia.

but what makes it special is that it has an exhibition actual artifacts used by podlaski pharmacists local medicine [Music] this exhibition is certainly one of a kind it is devoted to the technologies of eye care existing in the 70s and 80s this machine in particular is interesting because it is meant to suck metallic parts out of the I said to be a horrific painful process and often double damages the eye that's already incurred Trump [Music] it's almost incomprehensible that such a regal space accommodates the average medical student here in this city I cannot say that my university looked like this I regret that it didn't and so with that let's move on as I said before the always stock is known as a city of many cultures and religions among the residents there are Catholics Protestants

had it on undiscovered and I'm ready to give this a try [Music] okay so my initial take aways here certainly mean it's not Patti and you know that there's a high quality meet because it's extremely chewy it means that the animal had a life beyond just a small steel cage I think that this is a unique experience altogether and sadly I believe most people will never taste such quality meat as this

       " \"- Boom! (foreign language) What's up people? Ola, Vigo's dad here. Welcome to another episode. Guys today, we're gonna\\ndo a reaction video. We're gonna react to an\\nAnimated History of Poland. I remember that I saw this\\nfilm like around a year, a year and a half ago, and\\nI liked it quite a lot. I remember that was quite touching. The graphics were astounding. I read somewhere that it\\nwas created by the same team that developed The Witcher game. What we saw there The Witcher\\non Netflix was fantastic. We're waiting for another season. I have not seen the\\noriginal one in Polish, but I promise you that I\\nwill come around to it. What I did do for this reaction video is that I kinda like\\nprepared a little bit. I don't know if you're gonna\\ncall this cheating or not, I hope you can bear with me. But I went and researched\\nsome of the dates that are shown the video. The video has in the bottom\\nleft corner some dates of the events that are happening or that they are recreating there. And I am not so well\\nversed in Polish history and I know that a lot of my\\nsubscribers are not Polish. So I want to mention some of\\nthe things that are happening, just so that, you know, myself and the people that\\ndon't know these events can have an idea of what they're\\nseeing here on the screen. So without further ado, let's react to an animated\\nhistory of Poland. And let's begin. (orchestral music) An animated history of Poland. And the graphics just hit you immediately. This the year, 800, 900. This is like the middle ages. Right like early middle ages. (gentle music) Was I gonna have my cheat\\ncheat here reading some of the stuff. This marks the beginning\\nof the culture distinction between Western and Eastern Europe Got the map. Polska, Panstwo, Vwohe So we have a Church in 1966, Okay they're turning down\\nsome pagan gods here. So this is Christianization of Poland. I think this is, (foreign language) The a introduction of\\nChristianity in Poland. Here we have the, I'm reading, Mieszko I, the King. (groaning) Year 1000, battles were so brutal. Those battles back then. Year 1200. (light airy music) Which is this? What's happening here? This is a Golden Bull of Rimini. Okay, this is the Golden Bull of Rimini. It's a decree by Emperor\\nFrederick II in Rimini. He'd granted and confirmed the privilege of territorial conquest. Conquest and conquest. Humans are always trying\\nto conquest things. (light airy music) And then devastation. Year between the-- This is the 14th century. Year 1333 this is, ah! This is Casimir III the Great, right? He says that he inherited\\na kingdom that was weakened and then he made it\\nprosperous and wealthy. (triumphant music) This is 1364. The Congress of Kraków This was a meeting of\\nmonarchs that were trying to propose an anti-Turkish crusade. I can see this here. look at the graphics. Let's just appreciate the graphics. This is fantastic, it really\\ndoes look like a video game. (orchestral music) Oh, again that's the Kraków square, right? I could see the church there. That's of course some development and you can see agriculture,\\nreturns into houses. Oh, this guy I remember,\\nwhat was his name? Władysław II he's Grand Duke of Lithuania. He turned Lithuania into\\nChristianity, he converted it. And also he says here\\nthat he laid a foundation for the centuries long\\nPolish Lithuanian union, which was very strong. The Battle of Grunwald,\\nhere with Władysław. This is Gada Ince I think,\\nI think that was Gada Ince. I've never been there. Oh look the, Jewish church. That's 16th century. Oh wonderful this is Nicolaus Copernicus. He proposed a new model\\nof the universe where, the sun was the center of\\nthe universe not the earth. I'm sure he got a lot of shot of for that, but in Poland, if you guys are Polish you should be very proud to\\nhave someone like Copernicus. He changed the world. So here we have the year 1619. What happened here? This is just early modern ages. This is the Polish-Lithuanian state, became very influential in Europe. 1883, the battles with\\nVienna, interesting. This is a battle of Vienna\\ntook place it in Kahlenberg. We've been to Kahlenberg yah. I think they have a Polish\\nchurch actually at the top of that mountain Kahlenberg. This is the 17th century\\nApollinaris, of course Apollinaris. It goes pretty fast. Oh guys, hold on, who is this guy? Can you please tell me who is this guy? And why is he throwing coins at people? You can see it on this scene\\nhere, right on the comments. I don't know, I was trying to\\nresearch, I cannot find it. 1772, this is the Partitions of Poland. This is the beginning\\nof the 123 years where the Poland literally\\ndisappear from the map. The first constitution of Poland, also was the first constitution in Europe, and I think the second in the world, only second to the American one. This is the 18th century. So this is the 1797, 1830, that's a big jump there, that is Poland. So brutal, 18--. This is I guess called the organic work, praca organiczna era, right? Poland I believe was a\\nbooming here during this time in the sense of culture and\\narts and industrial revolution. Oh, this is a fantastic scene, I love this 1918, This is The Second Polish Republic This is when Poland finally\\ncame back as a state in all the, remember that I discussed\\nthis on a past video Polish people who owned the\\nunderground Polish state. This modern times, 1922,\\nI guess after the war, Kino Polonia. See the artists work. You see Hitlera, I saw a Hitler\\nand of course here it comes Marks the beginning of\\nthe second world war when Hitler invaded war, in Poland. I remember reading that the Polish pilots were instrumental in Poland helping win, I don't remember if it\\nwas the first world war or the second, please correct me on that. Oswiencim, this is as\\nAuschwitz, its terrible, we've been there two times,\\nit is something very grim. You can feel the terrible vibe in there. Yeah, I think it was second\\nworld war where the pilots, the Polish pilots were\\nlike a deciding factor in the allies winning the war. Here's 1944, Hitler loses the war. Such a terrible time for Poland. And then of course the allies\\nabandoned Polish people and basically the Russians come and we just have mistake. People think that Poland\\nwas a communistic, they were never a communistic state like Romania was and Ukraine, but yeah. Solidarnosc movement in\\nGdansk they paved the way for the first elections Joachim Gauck won and became the first president of Poland after, you know, many many years being kind of\\nlike under the boot of of the USSR. Once again, not communistic country, but-- and then of course development. I remember when I went to Poland for the first time, what\\nalso surprised me a lot, the level of development,\\neducation of the people. Yeah, of course there are traces of, we call it traces of communism, but you know what I mean? And I think that's the\\nend of the video, right? Thank you. So yeah, I remember\\nthat I was so surprised when I went to poland at the beginning. I first spoke about this before, and just to imagine then, you know, 50 years prior to that\\nmoment, I went in 2012. You guys literally had\\na destroyed country. So yeah, mad respect. I think Polish people have gone through so many things\\nand still to be able to have the country that you\\nhave, developing every day. I know things are difficult at the moment and there they are all over the world. And I know many of you, you\\nexpress it on my comments. I get it. It's not easy, but you\\nhave a lot to be proud of. And that this animation was fantastic. I really, really enjoyed it. I know that it has some criticism. It left out some major\\nplayers, especially women, Polish women that changed\\nthe course of history. The one thing is that I feel that the events went\\na little bit too fast. So if you're not Polish,\\nit takes you a while. Hence why I prepare some a little document here to guide myself. But anyhow I hope you guys enjoyed it too. Boom. That's all guys. That's the end of the episode. I hope you liked it. If you did, please give us a thumbs up. Share this video with a\\nfriend or a family member.

       " 'Do you know what day it is today? January 13? And what is the day of the week? Friday? Friday. Friday the 13th. I don\\'t know how it is in your country, but in Poland Friday the 13th is a day when we don\\'t do anything important. Friday the 13th is an unlucky day. Anyway, this is not a typical Polish belief, because already in antiquity it was believed that it is an imperfect day. An unlucky day. While 12 was considered the perfect number, 13 as the first number following the perfect perfect twelve was the imperfect, unlucky number. I hope that doesn\\'t mean this video won\\'t work for me. If you don\\'t know me yet, my name is Ania, I\\'m a teacher of Polish as a foreign language, and this is Płynnie po polsku, a channel and podcast for people who learn Polish. Remember that if you feel the need, you can turn on subtitles for this video. And don\\'t forget that if you join my Patreon, you\\'ll get extra exercises and vocabulary lists for this video, and access to other exclusive content. Link to Patreon, as always, I put in the description of the video at the bottom. And we are starting today\\'s video about Polish superstitions. But before we start talking about superstitions in Poland, it is worth explaining something about the Polish vocabulary. In Polish we have two words: superstition and superstition. In everyday language, we use these words interchangeably and honestly, we don\\'t see what the difference is. We can say Friday the 13th is superstition or Friday the 13th is superstition. That is, something that we believe without reason, which has no basis, no explanation. We believe it will bring bad luck. But if we want to be precise in Polish, it is worth remembering that these words are not quite the same. Superstition is simply the belief, often unfounded, that some particular thing or some particular event will somehow change the situation. In turn, superstition is actually remnants of old beliefs. Therefore, superstitions are more associated with worship, with divination. I said Friday the 13th, but as you can probably guess, this is not the only superstition we have in Poland. Staying on the subject of bad luck, perhaps the most popular superstition after Friday the 13th is the black cat. If a black cat crosses your path just as you are on the road, you will be unlucky. This is not a typical Polish belief, a typical Polish superstition, because already in the Middle Ages in Europe it was believed that cats - black cats are helpers of witches. And another thing that brings bad luck is walking under a ladder. Luckily, it doesn\\'t seem to happen that often. When the ladder is unfolded, it forms a triangle, which is a perfect geometric figure. And going through it causes us to disturb the harmony of this figure. Therefore, it can bring us bad luck. And the worst thing is breaking a mirror. If you break a mirror, you will have seven years of bad luck. And this is also a superstition that comes from ancient times, because then it was believed that the cycle of human existence is divided into seven years. And breaking the mirror disrupts this cycle, so seven years of bad luck await us. In Poland, we also cannot open an umbrella indoors. And this also comes from the times when it was believed that the sun was a deity, and when we open an umbrella indoors, we offend the deity. In Poland, a lot of superstitions also apply to marriage, including, above all, finding a husband. A woman in Poland cannot sit on the corner of the table, because it is believed that if she sits on the corner of the table, she will become an old maid, i.e. she will never get married. A lot of superstitions are also associated in Poland with the very organization and planning of a wedding. So remember, for example, that if you are organizing a wedding in Poland, do not organize it in a month in which there is no letter \"r\". Because it will bring you bad luck. You have to get married in such months that have the letter \"r\" in them, August, June, September, October. It will bring you luck. And if you\\'re marrying a foreigner, unfortunately, superstition doesn\\'t explain which language is right here. In Poland, we also do not put the handbag on the ground. If you put your purse on the ground, it means you won\\'t have any money, because money that is close to the ground runs away faster. This means you\\'ll spend them faster. And if you happen to say something that you don\\'t want to happen, don\\'t forget to knock on unpainted wood right after. It will make you kind of take back what you said. We can treat it as a preventive, preventive action. When you meet Poles, you will surely notice that they will not want to greet you on the threshold of the house, on the threshold of the apartment. They\\'ll probably let you in first, and then greet you. In Poland, it is believed that greeting across the threshold is also bad luck. Apparently, it was once believed that in this way evil powers from the outside were let inside. And be sure to always be careful with salt. Because if you spill salt, you\\'re going to argue with someone. Of course, these are not all the superstitions that exist in Poland, we have a lot of them in Poland, and what\\'s interesting, even though we don\\'t believe in them theoretically, we try to do everything so as not to tempt fate. Be sure to let me know if there are any superstitions like this in your country, or if they are the same or different. And what do you think about superstitions, do you believe in them, do you actually try to avoid these things, or do you rather do things as you please and don\\'t care about superstitions. And even though today is Friday the 13th, I hope it doesn\\'t bring me bad luck on YouTube To prevent this and help me, you can like this video, subscribe to this channel if you haven\\'t already , go to my Patreon and have a look to other social media I am on, such as Instagram or Facebook.

here\\xa0\\xa0 here's another cathedral i might have to just go\\xa0\\ninto some of these cathedrals at some point and\\xa0\\xa0 put them out towards the end the\\xa0\\nmiddle or the latter part of the\\xa0\\xa0 video just if i put them in the middle\\xa0\\ni've noticed my engagements also drop\\xa0\\xa0 off like people are just like yeah\\xa0\\nyeah they like fast forward to video i'm actually getting hungry obviously\\xa0\\nthey got polish dogs probably right\\xa0\\xa0 or is that a guess guatemala coffee you guys\\xa0\\nsee our guatemala series we went to lake atitlan\\xa0\\xa0 and made a video of the capital of guatemala\\xa0\\ncity but that is where the coffee is sourced from so i'm going to keep\\xa0\\ncruising through the old town here\\xa0\\xa0 see what else we can uncover about warsaw a lot\\xa0\\nof people are telling me to go down to krakow\\xa0\\xa0 or warcraw which is a hard one pronounced\\xa0\\nit's uh actually more towards germany we've got a few places in poland poland's\\xa0\\ndefinitely underrated i mean if you were to\\xa0\\xa0 ask me about germany versus poland i might take\\xa0\\npoland as a tourist destination now to germany i\\xa0\\xa0 like germany don't get me wrong germany's got\\xa0\\nsome cool stuff but poland's just that good\\xa0\\xa0 if you go to germany you might as well do poland\\xa0\\nif you go to poland you might as well do germany\\xa0\\xa0 you know it's one of those kind of situations i'm ultimately trying to get to\\xa0\\none of my favorite cities ever\\xa0\\xa0 frog everyone keeps saying krakow is uh the\\xa0\\nbest in poland that's what i keep hearing wow what a beautiful city huh i'm gonna\\xa0\\ngo in here and get some food it looks like\\xa0\\xa0 let's see what they got it's\\xa0\\ntime for another pit stop that is what i ended up getting oh this is a russian one they\\xa0\\nsay it's silver and some amber i got a local lager this is the uh that's the name i think let's try it well\\xa0\\nthis is my soup it's got egg mushroom sausage yeah let's do it the other soup is delicious super delicious all right we have made it to the\\xa0\\nfountains look at this view up here right down\\xa0\\xa0 there is the beautiful river so the river is the\\xa0\\nvestula river and that is the multimedia fountains\\xa0\\xa0 let's go down there man that soup was so good\\xa0\\nseriously i think polish soup is delicious\\xa0\\xa0 it kind of burns your mouth a little bit when\\xa0\\nit's too hot and on a hot day like this you can\\xa0\\xa0 see people just kind of gathering around\\xa0\\nthis multimedia fountain for good reason so we're gonna head around to the rest of\\xa0\\nthe city of warsaw show you some other areas\\xa0\\xa0 uh like the new town and some other places\\xa0\\nactually uh check the time stamps below\\xa0\\xa0 so as i walk up into the old town center\\xa0\\nyou can see some nice architecture and some of the old homes at\\xa0\\nleast the styles that were rebuilt\\xa0\\xa0 i don't think those are original homes but\\xa0\\nthey are rebuilt of how the homes and people\\xa0\\xa0 were living you can see many different units\\xa0\\nkind of side by side right here in the old town\\xa0\\xa0 let's go back up there though as we go\\xa0\\nthrough the fort here the old fortress getting another look here\\xa0\\nat the old village fortress fortification i actually want to go back in here\\xa0\\nto see if it uh picks up vibes now that it's\\xa0\\xa0 actually four o'clock in the afternoon almost\\xa0\\njust generally good vibes people are smiling\\xa0\\xa0 friendly laid back not pressuring you for anything\\xa0\\nand just a good experience i would definitely\\xa0\\xa0 recommend when you come down here trying a beer\\xa0\\nand then walking around especially you know if\\xa0\\xa0 your first time here because if it's your first\\xa0\\ntime you need that little icebreaker to put you\\xa0\\xa0 in a good mood and kind of settle you down because\\xa0\\nwhat i've noticed is when you go to these like\\xa0\\xa0 new places where they're very crowded\\xa0\\nsometimes it's easy to get kind of anxious\\xa0\\xa0 but that beer that wine that cocktail or\\xa0\\nwhatever you like just kind of takes the\\xa0\\xa0 edge off that's why i recommend that and\\xa0\\nfor me it works every time like a charm now if you're going to a museum on the\\xa0\\noutskirts of town you might not need that\\xa0\\xa0 but when you're walking around an old town\\xa0\\nor a new city for the first time something\\xa0\\xa0 to take that little edge off really works wow as\\xa0\\ni was walking by this place it's called strolaski look at all that food right there\\xa0\\ni saw that and i was like dude\\xa0\\xa0 i need to do something like\\xa0\\nthat is that a schnitzel freaking awesome great place right there\\xa0\\ni would if i didn't just eat and i was\\xa0\\xa0 not going to these museums over here\\xa0\\ni would definitely stop there and have\\xa0\\xa0 probably the schnitzel or the cabbage\\xa0\\nand chicken i don't know i love it i would definitely come back to\\xa0\\npoland based on my experience so far\\xa0\\xa0 everything about it is fantastic look\\xa0\\nat these pigeons oh those pigeons are look at that beautiful pigeons\\xa0\\xa0 and lovely lady of course you can't mention\\xa0\\nthe pigeons without mentioning the lovely women\\xa0\\xa0 because they're everywhere in poland polish\\xa0\\nwomen are awesome they're so friendly\\xa0\\xa0 like every polish girl i've talked to is\\xa0\\njust so friendly look at this guy

A Poland left beaten, a Poland left broken. Stripped of their right to assembly,\\nand their right to their language. A multi-ethnic population, now absorbed into 3 separate empires. With tensions with France rising in the West, and all 3 of these nations coming into Napoleon\\'s crosshairs - - what was the future of Poland to be? The turn of the century brought with it uncertainty, rebellion, and hiding beneath it all: a spark of nationalism, ready to be stoked. *Intro music and whatnot* Life under imperial rule wasn\\'t great, and the Poles\\nbegan searching for a way out almost immediately. Restrictions had been placed on their language and religion. They were treated as second class citizens. Many musicians, artisans, poets and engineers, all fled\\npolitical persecution, and lived out their days in exile. A people hard to quell, a people in search of solidarity. If only they could get help from someone on the outside. Napoleon: a despot, a tyrant,\\na threat to the monarchy. Or, a champion of the Republic,\\na breaker of subjugations. A military genius with bold ambition. Napoleon was all of these things, and none of them. But to the Poles... to the Poles, he was hope. Poland ended up being an important ally of Napoleon during his coalition wars. And he had granted them autonomy under the Duchy of Warsaw, in gratitude for their help. But after the failed invasion of Russia,\\nthe Poles found themselves once again occupied, by the advancing Russians, who then annexed more territory, than they had in the partitions. The brief rebellion by the Polish people,\\nnow vanished with Napoleon\\'s exile. So, was it all nor nothing then?\\nWell, not really. The Age of Rebellion kept alive the spark,\\nthat had burned brightly with Napoleon. Uprising after uprising was fought,\\nand each generation was taught of the one, that had preceded it - inspiring new resentment and new rebellion. The Poles found solidarity in their religion, their language and their customs. Eventually forming a romantic nationalism, that would not be snuffed out. Instead of being successful militarily, they were successful in keeping the Polish spirit alive. Along with influential people, like Mickiewicz and Chopin. As the decades crept by, and the hope for Poland seemed lost, there began to appear some light on the horizon. The Prussians and Austrians had gone to war for supremacy over German nation-state, and Germany had been born out of the rubble. This, for many reasons, was not good. Suddenly, Europe\\'s intricate balance of power had been destroyed. A war for dominance over the continent seems inevitable in hindsight to us now; but in those days it was diplomats, who saw the coming danger. Pressure was building, diplomacy was failing. Power was imbalanced. Something had to give... but what? World War I began with Austria and Serbia. But soon, turned into a multi-alliance pan-European war, fought on every part of the continent. The former allies of Austria, Germany and Russia were now enemies. The former Polish lands were the epicenter of the Eastern front, and Polish armies fought on both sides. And both sides were promising the Poles their freedom, in exchange for their help. Eventually, the Russians and Romanians would be defeated, and forced to hand over all their Polish lands to Germany, in a peace treaty. Setting up and occupied piece of territory for Polish people, they more than likely had no intention of letting them keep. But with Russia knocked out of the war,\\nthe Americans had entered it, and one of Woodrow Wilson\\'s 14 points, was support for a liberated Poland. With the defeat of Germany in 1918, Polish officials reclaimed much of their former territory. And Józef Piłsudski was installed as the new leader of Poland, after a 123 years of foreign rule. But the fight was not over. The Bolshevik Revolution had left Russia to fight a brutal civil war, and once it was over, the Red Army set its sights on the Polish lands, they had recently lost. The brave Polish armies lined up to defend their homeland. Defending their capital of Warsaw,\\nthey stood ready for battle. Against all the odds, the Poles would go on to lead a seemingly miraculous defeat of the Red Army. In a stunning display of incredible bravery, and military prowess, the II Polish Republic was here to stay. Polish leader Józef Piłsudski envisioned the recreation of the multicultural Poland of the past. And reflected in this, the Second Polish Republic\\nwas among the most diverse at the time. The next few years, usually called the \"interwar period\",\\nwas dominated by strong, political rhetoric, radical ideas, and a high focus on foreign policy. That being said, it wasn\\'t the most stable government.\\nThere were even a couple of coups, here and there. Across the border, in Germany,\\nthings were pretty bad as well. The crippled economy and political turmoil, had allowed a radical like Adolf Hitler to come to power in 1933. Introducing sweeping reforms of government,\\nand seizing dictatorial-like powers, it was not long, before Poland came into Hitler\\'s crosshairs. Invading the Republic would allow Hitler to attain many of his short-term goals. Such as: seizing the industrial heartland,\\nand reaffirming Germany as a military power. But also, his long-term goals, of eradicating Jews and other undesirables, and invading his arch-rivals, the Communist USSR. But in a completely unexpected move,\\nthe Germans signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, secretly dividing Poland into two spheres of influence,\\nhoping to bide their time, and not fight a two-front war. (Good job guys, I think that\\'ll work out.) The German army invaded Poland on the 1st of September, 1939, beginning the Second World War. They were the first to taste the German \"Blitzkrieg\",\\na radical, new form of Lightning warfare, designed to punch deep into enemy lines,\\nand surround them, cutting off their defenses. Poland was not ready for this. Europe was not ready for this. The World was not ready for the Blitzkrieg. Poland fought bravely in defense of their homeland,\\nbut they were defeated in a few short weeks, Warsaw being heavily bombed until September 27th. Just to briefly clear something up:\\none myth spread by German propaganda, was the ineptitude of the Polish army, using\\nsabered cavalry against the German Panzers. Which is completely false, there is\\nno record of this ever happening. And both sides had heavily armed cavalry units, it wasn\\'t that uncommon. The fall of Warsaw, however,\\nwould not be the end of the fight. Thousands of troops evacuated, and joined the armies of the Allied Powers, and continued to fight thoughout the war. Many thousands more, civilians and soldiers,\\nwent into underground resistance, in towns and forests, to continue fighting the Germans and the Russians. Poland was one of the worst-faired nations in World War II. Combined military and civilian casualties, Poland lost\\nthe highest percentage of any population in the war. With one fifth of Polish citizens dying in combat, or in mass executions. Of the 6 million Jews killed during\\nthe Holocaust, half of them were Polish. As the Red Army advanced into Polish territory in 1944, the army in Warsaw rebelled against the German occupiers. They hoped, that the Soviets would join them to retake the city from the Nazis. But this would not happen. The Soviets were not their allies. Nor did they come as liberators. And stopped outside of Warsaw, and watched and waited, as the Germans slaughtered the Polish resistance, ignoring their radio calls for help. Once the Polish army was killed, and the Germans had retreated, the Red Army marched into the pile of rubble,\\nwhere Warsaw had once stood. The Red Army had also uncovered the brutal death camps in Poland, set up to exterminate Jews and other minority groups by the Nazis. News of this horror would soon spread throughout the world. With the Polish foreign army, and the domestic army now fighting on both fronts, the European theater ended with a joint occupation of Germany, by the Allied armies in the West,\\nand the Red Army in the East, in 1945. Poland lay in waste and ruins, swapping out one occupying army with another. And one madman dictator, for another. For better or worse, the Red Army was once again on polish soil, and the atrocities and war crimes the committed on their advance, meant, that their stay would likely be an unpleasant one. Uncertainty was on everyone\\'s mind. The citizens of this central European nation could\\nfeel Stalin\\'s cold, clammy hands on their throat. Would their sovereignty stay intact? Would they remain a people inspired by liberty and stoicism? How could they face the challenge, of rebuilding their nation, and come to terms with the brutality of the Holocaust? As the British, French, and Americans strained they eyes, to watch and see, what the Soviet government was going to do next, their view became obscured by a giant, iron curtain.

       " '- Today, I\\'m going house hunting for the very first time in my life. This is interesting. (upbeat music) And guess what? I\\'m house hunting in the\\nmountains of Southern Poland. There\\'s a magic here. So today I get to check out some really interesting properties, ranging from the very\\nrundown to the very plush. But will any of them\\nturn out to be the one? This place is one in a million. Here\\'s a bit of context. Over the last year or so, I\\'ve been dreaming of\\nfinding a place to call home. And originally I imagined that to be in the Western United States. Last year when I spent a month in Montana, I just felt so at home. I really felt like that was my place. But given the craziness of the\\nreal estate market in the US, I kind of gave up on that dream. And honestly, that\\'s a\\npretty hard reality check. So last week, I shipped my\\nentire life back to Europe, including my truck, all my\\nstuff, and my dog, Vilk. Hey buddy, does Europe smell different? So, I guess that means\\nI\\'m kind of committing to finding something out here. (foreign language) Let\\'s see if I can find my dream\\nproperty in the Motherland. Yes, I wanna have something\\nequally traditional, but. Well, welcome to Poland. I am Polish, in case you didn\\'t know, although, I haven\\'t lived\\nhere in over 20 years. I moved away when I was a kid and spent most of my life in the UK. And to be completely honest with you, I didn\\'t think I\\'d ever\\ncome back, not to live here, or at least, not to try and\\nfind a place to live here. But here we are in my search for a home, I have come to the Carpathian\\nMountains in Southern Poland, one of the most magical places in Europe. And today I\\'m gonna see if I can find a place to potentially call home. (Eva laughing) Isn\\'t that kind of crazy? Isn\\'t that just so wild, that\\nI could live here, maybe? (car engine starting) I knew exactly who to call upon to learn more about life in the mountains. They\\'ve been living\\nhere for over 10 years, and in that time they\\'ve managed to build a true slice of heaven,\\nlargely by themselves, but they started out\\nwith just a ruined barn, little money and a big dream. Here, I brought them a gift\\nall the way from Montana. Hope they enjoy it. - Wow. - This is Gorna Chata. A small boutique hotel\\nthat Kasia and Leszek lovingly built on the\\nside of this mountain over the last decade. It\\'s so hard to describe in words the level of silence and serenity I feel every time I come to visit them. If I could move in here\\ntomorrow, I probably would, (Eva laughing) but since that\\'s not really an option, I\\'ll have to find my own oasis. And I still think this is one\\nof the most magical places in all of Europe, if not the world, the Carpathian Mountains. It\\'s, yeah, probably my favorite\\nspot on the continent. You know, it\\'s kind of\\nfunny how this is really such a gem and it\\'s kind\\nof still a hidden gem. I mean, in Eastern Europe, you know, people know about the\\nCarpathian Mountains, but out west, nobody\\nknows about this place, which is what makes it so\\nspecial and so pristine, still. (calm music) And I think that\\'s why\\nI would like to come and maybe live here, because\\nit still feels wild. Since I came here for the\\nfirst time two years ago, I have just been completely in love with what Kasia and\\nLeszek have created here. And quite honestly, I kind of wanna use some of\\ntheir ideas as inspiration for my future home. So I\\'m gonna go and\\ncheck out their cottages, which are for rent, by the way, and see what I like about them. \\'Cause man, this is like, this place is one in a million. It\\'s incredible. (serene music) This kind of bathtub, oh yes. Okay, but the best part about this cottage and the one that I find most inspiring is this upstairs area. (serene music) Oh my God, I remember sitting\\nhere in this very hammock two years ago and thinking about how much I wanna make a\\nplace like this my home. Someday you\\'ll see me\\nmaking videos about building a wooden hut in the forest. And now I\\'m back and I\\'m\\nactually looking around. (serene music) So, this living room here is,\\nobviously, absolutely huge. And I probably wouldn\\'t need\\na dining table this big, but I just love the like earthy feel here. I love all the decor. I love how light it feels. There\\'s so much light coming in. I love the fairy lights,\\nobviously, they\\'re so cute. Okay, so then, they\\'ve\\ngot this beautiful terrace with a tree growing\\nthrough the middle of it. How cool is that? You know, there\\'s a\\nmillion holiday cottages and home designs out there that, you know, are really beautiful and\\nluxurious and that look natural, but Kasia and Leszek, I\\nthink can teach me a lot about like how to integrate\\nnature into my future house. They\\'re like all about\\nsustainability, truly and deeply. They\\'re about unique design\\nand, you know, they\\'re vegan. They have animals that they\\ntake care of here on this land, but you know, that don\\'t work or anything. I\\'m happy to have them as teachers. So I\\'m gonna go and ask\\nthem some questions about what it\\'s like to live here and whether my dream of possibly building a house here is actually realistic. It might give me a reality check, but I need to know. I need to know. (upbeat music) But before we get into the hot tub, a quick word from the\\npartner of this video and one of my ultimate\\ntravel hacks, Surfshark VPN. Today we\\'re gonna learn\\nabout the advantages of using Surfshark VPN with Vilk. Hey buddy, did you say you\\nhad some questions about VPNs? (dog grunting) (upbeat music) Well, buddy, since we travel so much, we\\'re usually using hotel and Airbnb wifi, and there\\'s really no way to know whether any of those\\nnetworks are actually safe. They do give us a sense of false security, but they could actually be\\nhiding many different privacy and security threats. Got it? Still following? (dog grunting) So if you ever use\\nunfamiliar wifi networks to make online purchases or access any kind of personal data, including online banking, you could be compromising your privacy. So to prevent that, I\\njust turn on Surfshark VPN and it keeps my location secret and encrypts, basically\\nsecures, all of my online data. (dog panting) Yes, I\\'m glad you asked. So Surfshark allows you to access content and content streaming services\\nfrom all around the world. For example, if you wanna watch reruns of your favorite show, but it\\'s not available\\non the Netflix catalog in your country, you can just switch locations\\nand look in another country. For me, that\\'s definitely \"The Office\". Oh, I guess he doesn\\'t\\nknow what \"The Office\" is. Well, I think I\\'ve got something that you might like in the UK. (wolf howling) Well, we\\'ve already got our Surfshark VPN, so we\\'re good to go. And you guys can also benefit\\nfrom a Black Friday deal. Just go to this link, enter\\nmy promo code, evazubeck and enjoy up to six months of free VPN. I also left the link in\\nthe description box below. Oh, and by the way, there\\'s a\\n30 day money back guarantee, so there is really no\\nrisk in trying it out. Well, safe to say that\\nKasia and Leszek gave me just the push I needed to get out there and start seeing some actual\\nproperties in the area. But before going totally\\nin on the wild idea, I wanted to see what\\'s out there. And the first property I\\'m going to visit is this ruin of a\\nmountain hut in the woods. It looks like this is the\\nroad that the hut is on, and if it\\'s true, then\\nthat means that the hut is really close to the main road, which is a bit of a bummer. I kind of, I wanted to go somewhere a little bit more remote, but let\\'s see, let\\'s check it out. Maybe I\\'m wrong. Okay, this is not it. But I was told that I\\nshould go across this plot and into the woods, somewhere over there. When I called a real estate\\nagent about this place, she said that these buildings\\nhere will be taken down because the person that built\\nthem didn\\'t actually have a building permission. So, yeah, that sucks. (intense music) Okay, I think I see the hut. It\\'s right here. Oh my God. (Eva laughing) This is, this is interesting. (intense music) Hey buddy, do you like it? It\\'s absolutely gorgeous. It\\'s a traditional Polish,\\nCarpathian Mountain hut, built in the traditional style. You know, this is the kind of hut that shepherds would\\'ve lived in, and you still see a lot of these buildings all around this region. So, I don\\'t have the keys because\\nthe real estate agent said I could just look inside to see for myself the state of the place. Huh. Yeah. Wow. That\\'s bad. (Eva giggling) That\\'s so, so bad. Nah, absolutely not. I mean, it\\'s, it is a ruin, but I think that\\'s almost secondary. The main thing is the hut is right next to a\\nreally busy, really loud road, and it is $125,000 for a very\\nsmall plot of land and a ruin and a really bad location. I mean, seeing it, I\\'m like, yes, I wanna have something\\nequally traditional, but hearing it,\\n(Eva giggling) I also know that I just\\nwanna be as far away from roads as possible. So, yeah, this bacowka is not for me. Let\\'s get outta here, buddy. (serene music) I would say that this property here, was like on the lower end\\nof the spectrum for me. As in, I would only invest\\nin renovating a mountain hut if it had like a really\\nspectacular location, you know? Then I might think about it, but this is not it, so. There\\'s a few more places\\nI wanna check out though, so all isn\\'t lost. Let\\'s go and see them. After seeing this bacowka or mountain hut, I thought back to what Kasia and Leszek shared with me earlier. This next house I\\'m about to see is very, very, very different. I\\'m kind of excited to see it. The villa we\\'re about to see is definitely way out of my price range, but you know, it can\\'t hurt to see a\\nbeautiful mountain home for some inspiration. This is a very plush,\\nturnkey villa overlooking the Podhale Mountains. This house is so beautiful. (serene music) (Eva sighing) Oh my God, such a dream. (serene violin music) Okay, wow, I can already see it\\'s so huge. So this is the living room and there\\'s a pretty small kitchen here, and it\\'s all just decked out\\nin this beautiful natural wood. And this fireplace, also super traditional\\nPolish old-school style and I definitely want\\none of those in my house in the future. All right, well, let\\'s check it out. It\\'s pretty huge, so, we better get going. So there\\'s an office here downstairs, which is very lovely. Okay, room number one. Room number two, three, and room number four. Okay, I guess this is the master bedroom. So nice. And here is one of the bathrooms. What is that? (Eva giggling) Oh my God, is this like a, oh my God, it\\'s like a sit-in sauna. That is wild. But this is not everything, there\\'s also like a whole basement area. Room number 85, room number (door opening) 86, room number 87. Oh, what\\'s this? It\\'s locked. (Eva knocking) That\\'s kind of creepy, like the entrance to a secret tunnel or a torture chamber or something. (door closing) I think I wanna get outta here now. Well, this house is such a dream house. The architecture is so perfect. It\\'s exactly how I would\\nwant my future house to look, but this is not the one because it\\'s way too big. It\\'s so huge. I don\\'t even need a building\\nhalf this size, you know? I mean, yes, there is a beautiful view, but only if you look that way. If you look to the right and to the left, you\\'ve got neighbors and the garden is very small. So for about four, just over $400,000, nah, this is not the one. Knowing the price and\\nthe size of this villa I thought back to what Kasia\\nand Leszek shared with me when we met up. Well, let\\'s recap. Renovating a total ruin\\nnext to a busy road, uh, not an option. A plush turnkey mansion with an epic view but loads of neighbors and too much space and also too expensive, not an option either. But there\\'s one more. Okay, here we are, this is the last house that I\\'ll be seeing today. It\\'s a bit of a wild card, I\\'ll admit, but I was just really curious to see what it would be like to live\\nin the middle of a village in a really beautiful historic house. So, let\\'s see. (serene music) If you can ignore my\\nshoddy camera work here, that would be very appreciated, thank you. This house has been standing on its own and abandoned for almost 30 years, and in that time, nobody\\nhas paid the light bills. It was a strange mix of the\\ntwo properties I saw earlier. A bit of a ruin, yet retaining some of that\\ntraditional mountain grandeur with beautiful wooden interiors, those dreamy Eastern European\\nstoves and fireplaces, and clearly, a lot of work ahead for anyone willing to invest in it. There\\'s even a little side house, what we might traditionally\\ncall an (foreign language) in Polish. A small room with many functions and sometimes, a whole\\nfamily living inside it. I mean, such a cool\\nidea to like go in there and restore a house like that, but I won\\'t even know\\nwhere to begin, you know. That is just such a huge project. And the house is in the middle of village, which I didn\\'t quite appreciate. So it\\'s not really the kind of, you know, natural oasis that I\\'ve been dreaming of. So, not the one. None of those three\\nhouses were quite right. So far, I wasn\\'t finding\\nanything even remotely realistic, but then again, I wasn\\'t really expecting to find anything right away. Instead, I was hoping to use\\nthis as a learning experience, you know, to see what\\'s even out there. And here are my biggest takeaways. A traditional architectural\\nstyle, yes, a big yes. A great view, another yes. Ah! A big plot of land, yep. Neighbors, nope. Size, you know what they say about size. No, but seriously, something\\nsmall will suffice. Well, I loved seeing all three properties and learning more about what\\nI liked and didn\\'t like, but for now, winter is quickly arriving in the Polish mountains and that is not a good time\\nto house hunt out here. The snow gets serious. So I\\'m gonna keep my eyes peeled\\non the real estate websites and hopefully come back\\nin a couple of months to see if anything else has popped up. But for now, I am headed south, much further south,\\ntowards warmer weather.

       " \"Under the cover of darkness on September 7th,\\n1512, near the village of Pashino, deep in Muscovite territory, a group of Poles were building\\npontoon bridges on the Dnieper in order to cross the river. Next to them, smaller groups of light cavalry swam\\nacross and proceeded to dry their clothes and armour. Infantrymen floated on rafts to reach the\\nleft bank of the river, while the main part of the Polish-Lithuanian army waited for the\\nconstruction of the bridges to be completed. Once the engineers completed the job, parts\\nof the infantry started to cross the bridge, followed by cannons and heavy cavalry. But… unable to carry the weight, one of\\nthe bridges collapsed. Despite these difficulties, by early morning\\nthe Polish-Lithuanian army, totalling 30,000 men, was ready to move east to recapture the\\nimportant Lithuanian fortress of Smolensk. But… in front of them stood the Muscovite\\narmy, twice as big, and deployed in battle formation. The  Grand  Duchy of Lithuania united with Poland in 1386,\\nunder the rule of the Jagiellon dynasty. This powerful new state was comprised of Polish,\\nLithuanian, and Ruthenian lands, as well as territories conquered in the East by the Lithuanian\\ndukes over the course of the fourteenth century. This expansion, however, clashed with the\\nambitions of a new emerging power in Eastern Europe. The Muscovite princes had finally thrown off\\nthe Mongol yoke, which lasted for nearly TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY years. It was now time to look outwards. Their objective was to unite all lands populated\\nby the Ruthenian- and Russian-speaking peoples, but this would have to come at the expense\\nof Lithuania. And, during the rule of the Grand Prince Vasili\\nIII, Moscow’s western expansion pushed the border to the Dnieper river. This drastic shift in the balance of power\\nconvinced the King of Poland, Sigismund I, who had until now largely stayed out of any\\nconflicts in the East, to intervene. But Sigismund faced a problem. During the early 16th century, the kingdom’s\\nGeneral Parliament grew into a powerful political institution, becoming one of the primary elements\\nof democratic governance in the Polish dominion. This limited the power of the Crown. Without Parliament approval, the King could\\nno longer unilaterally pass new laws, nor freely use the kingdom’s annual tax income\\nfor military spending. In effect, Sigismund was not able to wield\\nthe same power his predecessors once could. Complicating matters further, in 1512, Albert\\nof Prussia became the new Grand Master of the Teutonic Order and had refused to acknowledge\\nPoland’s suzerainty, thus breaking an oath of fealty to the Polish King. Worse, to alleviate pressure on Lithuania,\\nSigismund plotted with the Crimean Khan to attack the Grand Duchy of Moscow from the\\nsouth – a plot that Vasili’s spies had uncovered. Pretext in hand, the Grand Prince was not\\nabout to pass up on the opportunity to take advantage of the changing political dynamics\\nin Poland to continue Moscow’s territorial expansion. He tasked the Boyar Ivan Andreyevich Chelyadnin\\nwith supervising the campaign to take the strategically vital city of Smolensk. This city was of huge strategic importance\\nfor Vasili, because to attack Moscow, any hostile army that was located further west\\nwould have to pass right through Smolensk. Worse, while in enemy hands, this well-fortified\\ncity also threatened the military endeavours of the Russians, so the one who controlled\\nit held a very favorable strategic position. At the time of this attack, the Muscovites\\nalso tried to attack Polotsk, but this was unsuccessful, so these forces were diverted\\ntowards the siege of Smolensk. In the meantime, a little further south, the\\nGrand Hetman of Lithuania Konstanty Ostrogski invaded Moscow’s territory and inflicted\\nheavy defeats on the Muscovite army in the region of Severia in several smaller battles. Here he defeated about 6000 Russians. But with the small number of troops at his\\ndisposal, he could not oppose the main army of Vasili III that besieged Smolensk. A six- and four-week siege followed in 1513,\\nboth unsuccessful, but the Muscovite forces succeeded in taking the city in July 1514,\\ndealing a serious blow to Lithuania. Encouraged by their success, the Russians\\nconquered several smaller fortresses in the surrounding area and despite their large army,\\nthey decided to stop there. After the fall of the most important Lithuanian\\nfortress on the eastern border, the focus of the Polish parliament and nobility was\\nfinally directed towards the war with the Grand Duchy of Moscow. After long preparations during the summer\\nof 1514, the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania gathered around 35,000 soldiers\\nunder his command. The soldiers primarily came from Poland and\\nLithuania and were mostly horsemen, but certain mercenary contingents also joined the campaign,\\nalong with volunteer detachments from Bohemia. Most importantly, large numbers of artillery\\npieces were gathered to help recapture the lost fortress of Smolensk. From Vilnius, the Polish-Lithuanian army moved\\nsouth-east and stopped at Minsk to unite with units arriving from all over the country. After Minsk, Sigismund continued towards the\\neastern border to confront the Muscovites. Soon he reached the city of Borisov, a key\\ncrossing over the imposing Berezina river. There, he handed over command of the majority\\nof the army to Hetman Konstanty Ostrogski, while he remained in this position with about\\n5,000 men. Ostrogski continued with the main army towards\\nthe Dnieper River, which he had to cross in order to recapture city of Smolensk. Meanwhile, Ivan Chelyadnin, having learned\\nabout the movement of the enemy, had gathered the scattered Muscovite troops and decided\\nto confront the Polish-Lithuanian Army. However, his scouts reported that Ostrogski\\nhad a fairly large host under his command, so Chelyadnin decided to receive the battle\\nin a more favourable position. He retreated from Drutsk even further east\\nwhile slowing down the enemy's advance with smaller detachments. Then he crossed the Dnieper River and developed\\nhis battle positions to meet the enemy. The town of Orsha was a suitable river crossing\\ndue to the existence of two bridges in close proximity, which allowed for a quick transfer\\nof troops. This was precisely what the Russian commanders\\ncounted on, because the Polish-Lithuanian army had to first cross the Dnieper, before\\nthey could continue towards Smolensk. Indeed, on September 6, 1514, Hetman Ostrogski\\narrived near Orsha. There he halted his army to reconnoitre the\\nterrain and prepare his army for the crossing. Although the army of the Grand Duchy of Moscow\\nwas larger, Ivan Chelyadnin wanted to avoid a risky encounter. Instead, he patiently waited and observed\\nthe enemy, planning to attack while they were still developing their battle formations. Chelyadnin's army was predominantly composed\\nof cavalry, but its’ size is difficult to estimate. Some sources claim that it numbered as many\\nas 80,000 men. While the Muscovites definitely had a numerical\\nadvantage, the actual size of their army was much smaller, with the range between 40,000\\nand 60,000 troops being more likely. The Muscovites waited for two days for the\\nPolish-Lithuanian army to make the first move. But what they failed to realise was that only\\na portion of the enemy army was present. Ostrogski anticipated that Chelyadnin would\\ncontest the crossing, so he spread out smaller units of Lithuanian cavalry across a wide\\narea and had ordered the men to set up additional tents, light numerous camp fires, and make\\na lot of noise, to create the illusion that the entire Polish-Lithuanian army was at Orsha. The ruse worked. While the Muscovites expected to contest the\\ncrossing at Orsha, some 5 kilometres (just over 3 miles) northeast, Ostrogski had two\\npontoon bridges constructed and moved the majority of his army across the river, during\\nthe night. When Chelyadnin finally learned of the movements,\\nhe rushed towards Pashino, but by then the Polish-Lithuanian army had already crossed. Ostrogski forces found themselves on a plain\\ncut by a ravine with the river behind them. Not far in front of them, a more numerous\\narmy of Muscovites took up position. Both sides realized that a pitched battle\\nwas upon them. Muscovites were composed of five large cavalry\\nregiments. The most numerous was under the command of\\nChelyadnin, in the center. In front of it was a smaller vanguard contingent. Stationed on each side were cavalry regiments. The reserves were positioned in the rear. The Muscovite army numbered between 40,000\\nand 60,000 troops. The Polish-Lithuanian Army formed in its classic\\nformation, The Old Polish Order. On the right, Sampoliński commanded the first\\nPolish line, comprised mostly of better equipped and heavy cavalry, while Świerczowski led\\nthe second and third. On the left, Ostrogski took charge of the\\nLithuanians in the front, with the second and third line commanded by Jerzy Radziwiłł. All told, some 30,000 Polish-Lithuanian troops\\ntook to the field. Around 2 PM, Ivan Chelyadnin ordered his army\\nto attack. The Muscovite plan was to use the terrain,\\nespecially the ravines and various bushes, in order to surprise the enemy, but their\\nmovements were spotted in time. The Muscovite vanguard took part in this attack, as well as\\nthe right wing under the command of Mikhail Golitsa. As the Russian vanguard was spotted, it was attacked by\\nLithuanian auxiliary troops with a hail of arrows. Muscovites responded with arrows volleys of\\ntheir own and a fierce battle began between Lithuanian and Russian archers. In the meantime, Ostrogski saw that the biggest\\nthreat to his army was the Russian right wing, which tried to sneak up and attack the Lithuanian\\nleft flank. In order to eliminate this danger, he could\\nrush towards the enemy and stop him; BUT since he mostly had light cavalry under his command,\\nit was questionable whether they would be able to stop the more numerous Muscovite right\\nwing. His lightly armoured cavalry would be especially\\nexposed to enemy’s arrows, and in case of a defeat on the left wing, he could lose control\\nover the pontoon bridges he had built earlier, which would lead to a catastrophic situation. Because of this, he ordered Sampoliński to\\nattack these enemy units so that instead of the light Lithuanian, the enemy would face\\nthe heavy Polish cavalry. The Polish horsemen rode straight through\\nthe arrow volleys exchanged by the Lithuanian auxiliaries and the Russian vanguard, and\\nhaving suffered minimal losses they crashed into Mikhail Golitsa's flank. The momentum of the Polish charge caused chaos\\nin the Russian ranks, leading to panic and confusion. Responding quickly, Chelyadnin ordered his\\nleft wing forward. Wanting to break the enemy line, he focused\\nthe attack was the now weakened Polish right wing. Outnumbered 3:1 on this part of the front,\\nthe Polish hussars and light cavalry managed to hold off the more numerous opponent with\\nfierce charges, followed by quick retreats. However, Chelyadnin still hadn’t committed\\nhis center. He watched the fight on the wings and sent\\nreinforcements when needed. Thus, seeing the difficult situation on his\\nright wing, he sent parts of his vanguard to their aid, aiming to attack the Polish\\nheavy cavalry from the rear. The Muscovite commander waited for the moment\\nwhen the enemy forces would get stretched thin, before launching an overwhelming attack\\non the Polish-Lithuanian center. His main goal was to capture the bridge and\\nprevent Ostrogski from retreating across the river. The Polish heavy cavalry, although initially\\nsuccessful in inflicting heavy losses on the enemy, now found themselves pressed from two\\nsides. Step by step their attack waned until they\\nfinally went on the defensive. In the meantime, Ostrogski rushed with his\\nunits to help the embattled Polish heavy cavalry, which was in a difficult situation. On the left wing, the Muscovites managed to\\nsuppress the outnumbered Polish right. The Poles gradually retreated and it seemed\\nthat it was only a matter of time before they would break and retreat towards the bridge\\nen masse. Chelyadnin’s plan succeeded. Ostrogski overstretched his lines, sending\\nmany of his troops to bolster the wings. Now, the Muscovite commander ordered the center\\nforward. They advanced steadily towards the fairly\\nweakened Polish center. But, personally leading from the front, Hetman\\nOstrogski raised the morale of the men and pushed back on the left. Mikhail Golitsa's units began a slow retreat\\ntowards the Dnieper River, suffering heavy losses. At the same time on the right, the Polish\\ninfantry, equipped with guns and pikes, arrived at their positions. They attacked the flank of the Muscovite left\\nwing from the forest, while the Polish cavalry, after a successfully performed feigned retreat,\\nstarted a counterattack. Surprised by close infantry and artillery\\nfire and the renewed hussar attack, Chelyadnin's left wing suffered terribly. A Many Muscovite officers fell, and panic\\nspread throughout the entire left wing. In the meantime, the Muscovite center finally\\ncollided with the weakened Polish-Lithuanian center. However, the battles on the wings were by\\nnow already decided. Ostrogski rallied his Lithuanians and now\\ncharged into the center while leaving Sampoliński and his heavy Polish cavalry to chase the\\nRussian right wing. Around this time, the Muscovite left wing\\nfled the field, followed by the Polish right. But the bloodiest phase of the battle began\\nwhen the last reserves of Poles and Lithuanians joined in the attack on Chelyadnin's center\\nand rearguard. The Muscovites put up a stiff resistance,\\nbut after a long fight and immense casualties, they eventually broke and fled. The pursuit lasted until sunset. Russian losses were enormous, with at least 13,000 perishing\\nduring the battle and another 5,000 captured. On the other hand, the Poles reported only\\n500 dead, a quite unrealistic claim. Given the ferocity of the fighting, it is\\nlikely that the losses went into the thousands. Nevertheless, the Polish-Lithuanian army inflicted\\na crushing defeat on the Muscovites at Orsha. After the battle, the Polish-Lithuanian Army managed\\nto regain control over some of their lost fortresses. However, the well-fortified and well-supplied\\nSmolensk required a months-long siege. Grand Duke Vasili III could not allow this\\nimportant fortress to fall into enemy hands again, and he did everything necessary to\\nkeep it. Despite failing to recapture Smolensk, news\\nof the Polish-Lithuanian victory in the Battle of Orsha spread across Europe. After defeating the Grand Duchy of Moscow,\\nthe Holy Roman Empire and other states decided to moderate their policy towards the Kingdom\\nof Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. However, the wars in the east continued. Vasili tried to avoid an open battle for some\\ntime, but already in 1518 a new army was raised and the offensive was renewed to conquer another\\nstrategic Lithuanian fortress… Polotsk.\",\n",
       " 'It\\'s rare that you\\'ll see Russian and \\nWestern media agreeing on anything, but one of the things that they can find \\ncommon ground on is that the Ukrainian War has taken on a thoroughly international \\ncharacter as time has gone on. While the most important \\nfactor has no doubt been the fighting capabilities \\nand spirits of both sides, it\\'s impossible to ignore the \\ninternational element when it comes to the materiel, economic and \\nmilitary support for Ukraine that has enabled the Ukrainian \\nArmed Forces to continue fighting well beyond what their initial financial \\nand materiel resources would have allowed. When I did my first video on this war, I said \\nthat I do not know how it\\'s going to end. And that statement remains \\nas true now as it did then. But what I remain confident in, and \\nwhat I think the numbers make very clear, is that one of the key \\ndetermining factors in how this conflict plays out is going \\nto be political willpower in the West. It\\'s going to be how long the Western \\neconomies are willing to sustain, and at what level they\\'re willing to sustain, \\nweapons and economic shipments to Ukraine. So Ukraine\\'s allies matter, \\nthe economic support, the military support that they\\'re \\nable to provide really matters. And what I\\'ve done here is I\\'ve stacked \\nup a list of countries who have sent military aid to Ukraine by their \\nWorld Bank 2020 GDP figures. And you\\'ve got some real heavy hitters on this list, the United States, Germany, \\nthe United Kingdom, France, Italy. Some of these who have \\nprovided very, very significant amounts of financial aid \\nor military aid, or both. And of course on that list the USA, as it \\nalways does, stands out as far and away the largest economy not just on this list, but also \\nthe largest economy in the world by many measures. America isn\\'t the only hero of this story, \\nthere are certain things that it lacks. It lacks a land connection to Ukraine to \\ndeliver weapons and support to the country. It lacks huge stockpiles of Warsaw Pact-era \\nequipment, which is the kind of stuff that Ukraine can use without a training burden, \\nstuff that was produced in the Soviet Union. America throughout the Cold War was busy, quite \\nrightfully, producing its own military hardware. It also lacks a colossal \\noversized axe to grind with Russia. America has a long-term rivalry with Russia, \\none that lasts throughout the entire Cold War, but it lacks the sort \\nof visceral commitment to the Ukrainian conflict some \\nother powers in Europe might have. And it also of course lacks \\na sense of existential threat. While Americans generally \\nhave been in majority support of providing support to Ukraine, of \\nstopping the Russians from taking it over, few Americans would go so far as to \\nsay the war in Ukraine actually offers any sort of existential threat to the \\nUnited States. Which is the kind of thing that tends to motivate a nation to go \\nfrom assistance to fanatical support. And so in that context I\\'m here to say today \\nthat some of those other allies that I listed, despite smaller economic sizes, have really been \\ncritical both to how this conflict has played out and also to what happens in the future. In essence I\\'m here to say \\n... that Poland matters. So what am I going to be covering today? I\\'m going to talk you through the \\nhistory of Polish-Russian relations. I\\'m going to be talking about Poland\\'s \\nstrategic situation and the contributions that Poland has made to the current war as one of \\nUkraine\\'s staunchest advocates and closest allies. Then to sort of bring the point home, \\nI\\'m going to talk about a counter-factual. I\\'m going to illustrate how the \\nUkraine War would have changed had Poland not provided \\nthe sort of support that it had. Indeed if Poland had come down, as some \\nin Russia hoped, on the Russian side. We\\'re also then going to look at \\nwhat this means for Poland itself. What does this mean for Poland\\'s \\nmilitary, both now and in the long term? What does this mean for \\nthe future of the Polish state, depending on the various ways \\nthat the Ukraine War might end. And also, why does this all matter? But just as we did with Finland and \\nSweden, before we jump into the today I want to start with some history. And because we\\'re now in eastern Europe as \\nopposed to up north, be prepared for a lot of tragedy. And a lot of chapters beginning with \\nthe words, \"And then it got worse...\" It\\'s just the way Slavs do things, OK. And I\\'m not doing this because of some \\ncontention that Warsaw is doing this because it\\'s still \\nreally bitter over 1772. And that getting back at \\nPutin by supporting Ukraine is actually some retribution for \\nthe Tsar\\'s partition of Poland. What I\\'m trying to say here \\nis that there is a long history that provides context to \\neverything that happens today. And because we\\'re talking about Europe, \\nthat history stretches back centuries. So I\\'m going to be looking at \\nPoland during the Commonwealth era, what happened with its independence, its \\nperiod under communism and the post-Soviet era. And perhaps the best place to start is \\nnot with Poland in the modern sense, but with the Polish-Lithuanian \\nCommonwealth, which is at its largest extent that big red blob that you \\ncan see on the map there. Which included most of Poland, Belarus, \\nmost of Ukraine, most of Lithuania, Latvia, and the territory that was \\nKönigsberg that became Kaliningrad. This was a major power \\nin Europe for centuries. With one of its most powerful militaries, \\na relatively dynamic economy. And a system of rights and privileges \\nthat was ... certainly not modern, but certainly more extensive than \\nwhat you would have expected to find either in Russia, or in most of \\nWestern Europe at the time. And just like Sweden, it turns out that \\nbeing a major power in this neighbourhood almost means inevitably that you \\nend up with a major rivalry with Russia. In 1610 they actually occupy \\nMoscow, this is sort of the high-water mark of \\nPoland-Lithuania competing with Russia. Now eventually they do leave, they go home, \\nand their puppet is overthrown. But it is something of a high water mark and an \\nachievement that relatively few invaders can claim. Now unfortunately for Poland it was kind of \\ntrying to do the EU thing before it was cool. In the sense that the Polish parliament, \\nand later the individual local assemblies, were subject to something \\ncalled liberum veto. Which is basically the idea \\nthat any individual member could stand up and veto any particular \\npiece of legislation or major reforms. Things like taxation or other reforms that you might \\nneed to do things like, I don\\'t know, defend the state. Which made the area really \\nvulnerable to hybrid warfare. Something its neighbours, \\nincluding Russia, quickly picked up. It was a relatively simple thing for example, \\nto find one noble or one member who, in exchange for a significant \\nbribe or influence from elsewhere, might be convinced to actively sabotage \\nthe operation of the Polish-Lithuanian state. Now that sounds a lot like \\nmodern hybrid warfare, so again: history doesn\\'t repeat, \\nbut it sure does rhyme. Unanimity proved a relatively \\nunworkable mechanism. And when you combined this with an elected \\nmonarchy, which meant that every incoming King basically sold away more \\nof the powers of the executive to the parliament in exchange \\nfor the backing of that parliament, you have a hollowing out of the centralisation \\nof the Polish state as time goes on. It\\'s very vulnerable \\nto that sort of sabotage. And the impacts are felt quite quickly. \\nBy 1654 something called \"The Deluge\" happens, this is only 40 years after the state \\nwas strong enough to occupy Moscow. The Deluge is a series of invasions, \\nprimarily by Sweden but also by Russia, that basically devastate and destroy \\nand hollow out the Polish-Lithuanian state. In terms of demographic losses, it\\'s \\nsomething like a third of the population. Economically the damage is greater. A number of historians actually \\ncontend that during this period more damage is done demographically, \\neconomically and culturally to the state than was done to Poland \\nduring World War Two. If that gets you an idea of \\nthe magnitude of the destruction that was wrought by the Russians, \\nand to an extent by the Swedes. As you might expect, after that \\nsort of damage and devastation there\\'s a long period of decline for the \\nPolish and Lithuanian Commonwealth. But to the end, it\\'s capable of \\nexecuting feats of great brilliance. The famous Battle of Vienna where the \\nWinged Hussars, which is the cavalry of Poland, some of the finest in the world at the time \\nwho used to wear wings on their backs, rode out to Vienna to save \\nAustria from ... a Turkish invasion. That happened after The Deluge. With the right \\nKing, the right moment, the right motivation even after The Deluge the Polish-Lithuanian \\nCommonwealth had a couple of signs of life in it. By 1772 it was basically all over. Prussia, Russia and Austria, all of \\nwhom had modernised to an extent, had reformed, and had \\nmuch stronger armies. But by 1772 it\\'s basically all over. Poland is wedged between Prussia, which \\nhas become a military power by the late 1700s, Russia has modernised to an extent and \\ngreatly built up the strength of its military, and ... Habsburg Austria (which \\nyou\\'ll remember the Poles saved about a century ago at \\nthis point) is a major power. And between 1772 and 1795 these three powers basically shake \\nhands and agree to partition Poland. Again history doesn\\'t repeat, but it rhymes. Over three partitions, \\'72, \\'93 and \\'95, \\nall of Poland is basically carved up and the Polish-Lithuanian \\nCommonwealth, and indeed the idea of a Polish state, \\nceases to exist for a time. There is a brief revival. \\nNapoleon comes in, kicks everyone around and he creates \\na puppet state, the Duchy of Warsaw. And he takes Polish troops into Russia \\nand burns Moscow partly with Polish troops. But after, as we know, Napoleon loses, \\nand the Duchy of Warsaw is dissolved. After that point most of Poland\\'s territory, if not its \\npopulation, is in what\\'s called \"Congress Poland\". Congress Poland is \\nbasically the bit of Poland that has done to it what happened \\nto Finland after Russia beat Sweden. It becomes a part of \\nthe Russian Empire, nominally independent, as something \\ncalled the Kingdom of Poland. Where again the King of Poland \\nis the Russian Tsar. But nominally it has its own culture, \\nits own language, its own institutions, and is generally able to govern itself. And again there\\'s a brief period \\nwhere that basically works. And then Russia moves \\ntowards Russification, and really importantly for Poland, \\nRussia starts to have ambitions of either converting the population \\nor at least suppressing the Catholic rite. There are a couple of things that people \\naround the world need to know about Poland. And one of them, and I\\'m not sure if this is exactly \\na secret, is to this day Poland\\'s pretty Catholic. And if you think about how Catholic \\nPoland is today, I want you to think about how Catholic Poland was \\nin the fricking 19th century. This did not go down well, and \\nPoland basically developed a reputation for catching on fire every couple of decades \\nas they tried to throw the Russians out because the Russians decided to try \\nand make them Orthodox Russians. So it might not surprise you then that come \\nWorld War One Poland is pretty fed up. And as soon as the Russian Empire collapses, \\njust like Finland, Poland \"nopes\" right out of there. So Poland gains its independence in 1918 \\nwith the nominal support of the Western allies. Russia decides to come back and invade in \\n1918, it doesn\\'t take them particularly long. The Soviet Union gets its act \\ntogether and then it invades Poland, with some ambitions, thanks to Trotsky, of \\nwalking all the way into Germany after Poland and securing the \\nWorker\\'s Revolution in central Europe. The Polish-Soviet War is brutal, \\nabsolutely brutal, in terms of the number of men \\nengaged and the casualty figures. But the Poles are able to \\nthrow the Soviet Union back. This is where the famous \\n\"Miracle on the Vistula\" happens. Where the Poles manage \\nto break the Soviet codes. Like one famous occasion where the \\nPoles jam Soviet radio communications by basically going onto \\nthe Russian\\'s radio channels and just blasting bible verses at them repeatedly \\nso the Russians can\\'t talk to each other. In any case, this victory isn\\'t \\nenough to save Ukraine, who Poland is basically trying to support \\nas a non-Soviet state during this conflict. But it is enough to preserve \\nPoland, at least for a while. Now, time for some rhyming history. 1939, the ... Soviets are back. And this time they\\'ve agreed with the \\nGermans to ... partition the Polish state. So Germany invades, \\nthe Soviets invade soon after, and Poland is crushed and partitioned. \\nSo ends the Polish state once again. Now the Soviets establish their power in \\ntheir part of Poland in some pretty brutal ways. There are some major massacres, which \\nof course they later try and blame on the Germans. World War Two then follows. The Germans \\nbetray the Soviets and attack the Soviet Union. All the while the holocaust comes to Poland \\nwith its very significant Jewish population. And then the Soviets push back \\nthrough Poland on their way to Germany. The result is that World War Two is an absolute \\ndemographic and economic catastrophe for Poland. Many nations suffered very, very badly, \\nbut Poland suffers particularly significantly. Its demographic experience is much more akin \\nto the countries of ... the western Soviet Union, as opposed to a country \\nlike France, for example. And of course the Soviets \\nfollowed this up by installing a Red government, a communist \\ngovernment that rules Poland until 1989. Now because it\\'s basically a Polish \\ntradition for centuries at this point, there are a number of uprisings, protests, \\nand many acts of resistance in Poland against the Red government and the wider \\nWarsaw Pact system over the course of the Cold War. And the moment that the USSR collapses and the \\nrisk of tanks rolling across the border disappears, Poland nopes out of communism basically as \\nquickly as it noped out of the Russian Empire. Now the point of going through all this \\nis basically to say that there is a history of enmity and conflict between \\nthe Poles and the Russians. Kind of like there is between \\nthe Finns and the Russians. Or the Japanese and the Russians. Or the Turks and the Russians. Or indeed, the Russians and the Russians. My point is that there are some old memories here, \\nand those memories fade exceptionally slowly. Polish statehood has itself been \\nquashed several times over. The state and its identity \\nhas been a target again and again for cultural, \\nreligious, or political conversion. And time and time again, one of the parties \\nto that particular process has been Moscow. And so we come to today, where Poland, \\nrather than being under the Russian thumb, is now part of the European \\nUnion, it\\'s part of NATO. Now Poland\\'s had, shall we say, complicated \\nrelations with the wider EU for the last several years. But it\\'s also critical to the European \\nUnion and to NATO, because it forms one of the keystone bricks in the sort of eastern \\nwall that protects Central and Western Europe. It borders Russia in \\ntwo directions essentially. Kaliningrad to the north, which is a Russian \\nenclave in what used to be Königsberg which is stuffed with Russian \\nmilitary units and missile systems. And then to its immediate east and \\nnorth east it\\'s got Lukashenko\\'s Belarus, which is a ... very close Russian ally, \\none would say puppet state. And a nation which allowed \\nRussian troops to enter its territory in order to attack Kyiv in the opening \\nstages of the Russian-Ukrainian War. And then to ... their south east it \\nhas a long border with Ukraine itself. Poland is in economic terms, \\nas I showed at the start, it\\'s not Germany, it\\'s not a developed \\nWestern European economy, but it is one with a strong population and \\nrelatively high GDP growth in past years. While it remains to be seen how the current crisis \\nand inflation will affect that economic growth, Poland has been generally growing faster \\nthan Western Europe for some time now. It\\'s also, and this is important to the \\ncurrent crisis, home to very large numbers of Ukrainian guest workers before the \\nwar began, and Ukrainian refugees now. So there\\'s a very close demographic, \\ncultural and linguistic link to Ukraine. And all of this, the history and \\nits current geopolitical position, means that Poland\\'s playing for \\npretty high stakes in the Ukraine crisis. Its economy, its prosperity, all this is deeply \\nintertwined with how the conflict resolves. A complete Ukrainian defeat for \\nexample, would put Russian forces and arguably Russian ambitions on \\nthe Polish border in the south east, probably in the form of some sort of puppet \\nUkrainian state under Moscow\\'s dominion. That\\'s something that Poland \\nobviously doesn\\'t want, especially when believe it or not, you can find \\nclips on Russian TV saying that Poland should be next for \"denazification\" \\nin the event that Ukraine is subdued. It\\'s also a nation that faces intense \\neconomic implications, political implications, military implications, if the war \\nin Ukraine goes the wrong way. Poland has economic links and great \\neconomic possibilities in Ukraine. Politically Poland has \\nstaked a lot on Ukraine as a potential member of the European \\nUnion, as a potential friend and ally. This, as well as the obvious military issue \\nof potentially having a buffer state removed and Russian military forces on their border, means \\nthat Poland\\'s now playing for very significant stakes. It\\'s fair to say that Poland\\'s got no desire to \\ngo back to the Warsaw Pact era, in a nutshell. And having Russian forces on their \\nborder with their potential ambition of further influencing their \\npolitics or their economy is something that Warsaw isn\\'t \\nparticularly willing to play for. And as a result Poland \\nhas gone essentially all in when it comes to providing support \\nto Ukraine during this conflict. And I focus on these stakes, because \\nI think they explain a little bit about the scale that we see Poland go to in \\nterms of supporting Ukraine. American support for Ukraine \\nhas been strong, make no mistake, but you have to imagine that public \\nsupport and support among politicians would be just that little bit \\nmore frenzied and determined if Russian victory didn\\'t mean \\nRussians ending up in Kyiv, so much as Russians \\nending up in, say, Ottawa. Which is basically the equivalent ... to the \\nsituation the Poles now find themselves in. So let\\'s have a little bit of a \\nlook at the sort of support that Poland has been \\nproviding in scale and scope. It\\'s hard to match to the limited resources \\nthat Poland\\'s had available to deploy. The first thing I want to talk \\nabout is the support for civilians. Poland has thrown its doors open to \\nUkrainian refugees literally by the millions. Those figures are very much out \\nof date in the graphic to the right, ... I include them mostly \\nto show the distribution. Of the millions of Ukrainians, \\noverwhelmingly women, children and the very old, who have fled Ukraine since the start of the war, \\na strict majority have ended up in Poland. Poland removed all visa requirements \\nand basically threw the border open to anyone who wanted to cross. They\\'ve \\ngiven Ukrainians access to the labour market, they\\'ve given them access to humanitarian \\nsupports, they\\'ve given them housing assistance. In terms of scale, for ... my American listeners, think about it as basically if the \\nentire population of Florida again, an entire new state of Florida, \\nbut bolted onto the United States, and the entire population \\nwas Ukrainian refugees. And when you adjust ... on a per capita \\nbasis, you kind of get a sense of the degree that Poland has \\nprovided support for refugees so far. Now this has immense \\nhumanitarian significance, but it\\'s also got economic \\nand military significance. Some of the great problems that Ukraine \\nare dealing with right now are things like fuel shortages, energy shortages, \\ndifficulties with their economy. And in a situation where you\\'re dealing \\nwith very intense logistical bottlenecks, that is there\\'s a limited amount of transport \\nbandwidth available to get stuff into Ukraine, being able to move these segments of the \\npopulation into neighbouring countries where they can be sustained \\nby those logistical networks, by those houses, by that \\nindustry and workforce. This does take some pressure off the \\nUkrainian economy at a critical time. Now because of the Ukrainian \\nrestrictions on men of fighting age leaving, the overwhelming majority of \\nthe people leaving have been children, who obviously aren\\'t \\npart of the labour force. The very old, who aren\\'t \\npart of the labour force. And the women who are supporting \\nthe children, who would likely have to support the children even if \\nthey had been back in Ukraine. So this is immensely important from a \\nhumanitarian perspective, it\\'s an act of great mercy. But it\\'s also important in \\nrelieving a little bit of the pressure on Ukraine\\'s domestic \\neconomy during this time. And I want to stress again, \\nit\\'s hard to understand just how many people have crossed \\nthat border. It\\'s hard to comprehend. Many nations in Europe and North America and \\nelsewhere have had so-called \"immigration crises\". And all of them pale in comparison to \\nthe rapidity and the scale of the movement of human beings across the Ukrainian border \\ninto Poland and the neighbouring states. So Poland\\'s taken in \\nwomen, children and refugees, and it sent back a whole \\nbunch of things that go boom. Poland sat on very large Warsaw Pact \\narms stocks before it went into this war, T-72 tanks and a variety of \\nweapons from the Warsaw Pact era. And it has shovelled them across the \\nUkrainian border basically as fast as they will go. As of late April, they had provided about \\n1.6 billion US dollars worth of weapons, which when you compare it to US support, is \\nextraordinarily out of proportion with Polish GDP. The United States at that time had provided \\nsomething like 3 billion in weapons supplies. Poland was at 1.6 but the Polish \\neconomy was smaller than 1/20th, it was 600 billion compared to the US 20 trillion. So the Polish effort \\nwas really out of all scale. And the other thing to note here \\nis that a lot of these weapons, because they were older, \\ncheaper, Warsaw Pact-era ones, while they didn\\'t exactly \\nrun up the bill in dollar terms, they were weapons that Ukraine \\nneeded right at that moment. That they could put into service without training \\nbecause they were familiar with the systems. So there was a huge amount \\nof bang for the buck there. There were things that America simply \\ncouldn\\'t provide because America didn\\'t have large stocks of these \\nweapon systems in hand. Poland did. And Poland was there to provide them at \\nthe critical juncture, and there are more on the way. So let\\'s break this down, \\nwhat are some of the key systems that have gone across the border \\nthat have made a difference so far. I\\'ll start with armoured vehicles \\nbecause everyone loves tanks. Now as of time of writing, Poland \\nhas sent more tanks to Ukraine then Ukraine is visually \\nconfirmed to have lost. Now I\\'m sure that Ukraine \\nhas lost many more tanks than they have visually confirmed on \\nOryx and other open source platforms. But the fact remains that Poland has been \\na major supplier of heavy armour to Ukraine. Poland had hundreds of T-72s \\nin reserve at the start of this crisis, mostly this M1R variant, and they have \\nbeen quick to ship those to Ukraine. Something like a quarter of the \\noverall Polish tank force has gone. Now yes, these vehicles were \\nslated for decommissioning. Yes, they were in reserve and \\nnot in active service any more. But they were exactly \\nwhat the Ukrainians needed because they were vehicles \\nthat Ukraine was familiar with. We have seen these vehicles \\nand Polish IFVs in Ukraine ... in the case of the tanks they have \\nbeen fitted with Kontakt-1 ERA blocks. And we have visually confirmed evidence of them \\ngoing into action on the Ukrainian battlefield. These are weapons systems that \\nhave not just crossed the border, they\\'ve made it all the \\nway to the battlefront. At a time where we know that attrition amongst \\nthe Russian armoured forces is very high, and that we\\'re seeing different sorts of \\nvehicles come out of Russian reserves, this sort of number, 200+, T-72s crossing \\nthe border from Poland into Ukraine to bolster Ukrainian armoured strength \\nis a very significant contribution. And then we\\'ve got small arms. \\nAnd if you thought this is a section where a guy named Perun is going to shill for the \\nPiorun anti-aircraft system, you\\'re absolutely right. Poland was quick to send \\ntheir domestically manufactured MANPADS to Ukraine \\nrelatively early in the conflict. This is the system you \\ncan see on the bottom there. And in terms of performance \\ncharacteristics it\\'s arguably quite superior to a lot of the Stinger missiles \\nthat have been sent to Ukraine. Stinger has got the fame, but \\na lot of the kills that we have seen that we have visually confirmed evidence of, \\ntend to be things like Starstreak or Piorun. There are also things like the Komar \\nwhich I put a picture up of earlier, in fact I\\'ll flick back to that momentarily, \\nthe Komar ... (which is the \"mosquito\") is an RPG system that I\\'m \\nshowing on the bottom there. Now this thing looks like it was made \\nin a garage, and quite possibly it was. It\\'s basically a rocket on a stick \\nwith a basic folding metal stock. It\\'s about as simple as \\nan anti-tank weapon can get. And during the Cold War Poland shat these \\nthings out like there was no tomorrow. Something like 100,000 of \\nthese things were made. And about 25,000 they were \\nstill trying to sell as of 2018. I don\\'t know how many \\nthey still have inventory. But it\\'s basically a very, very basic RPG \\nrocket on a stick with a folding metal stock. Now this thing has disadvantages. \\nIt has a very short range, it\\'s inaccurate, and it\\'s probably not going to be \\neffective against a modern Russian tank. But it\\'s also got advantages. You can learn to use it \\nin a couple of minutes, it weighs basically nothing. It\\'ll kill an APC or a BTR \\nor a truck perfectly well. And did I mention the thing where \\nthey had 25,000 of them as of 2018? Those are numbers. And at a time \\nwhen you\\'re trying to find weapons that you can hand to TDF or militia \\nunits that have just been raised who have no experience with anti-tank weapons \\nand they just need something right now, the Komar is a useful weapon system to have, \\nand Poland was willing to provide it. It\\'s also worth noting that Poland has \\nbeen willing to facilitate, shall we say, or allow to take place, many private purchases \\nthat are being funnelled through Poland. A lot of volunteer fighters or TDF guys, who \\nare having supplies brought in from overseas or are buying from international sources, \\nthose shipments are flowing through Poland. So even where Poland isn\\'t \\nproviding the weapons first hand, they\\'re critical logistically in terms of \\nallowing those small arms to make it through. And then let\\'s talk about things that are \\na little bit bigger, artillery and ordnance. Poland\\'s been a key contributor in this \\ncategory at every stage of the conflict. They were quick to supply \\nammunition. So ammunition for Warsaw Pact-era systems, \\n125mm shells, 152mm shells. Those things crossed from the Polish \\nborder over into Ukraine very, very quickly. And then they expanded that to include air-to-air \\nmissiles, they are the only confirmed source of air-to-air missiles that are \\ncompatible with Ukraine\\'s jets that we know for sure have \\nbeen provided to Ukraine. They also opened pretty early with \\nWarsaw Pact-era artillery systems. The 2S1, which is a \\nself-propelled artillery system. The Grad, which is that very famous \\nrocket system, which is where the Soviets decide to strap a pack \\nof rockets to the back of a truck. It worked in World War Two with \\nthe Katyusha, it works as well now. And those went relatively early, but Poland\\'s \\nalso been providing some more modern stuff. While America was debating, and \\nAustralia and others were debating, providing the M777 \\n155mm howitzer system, Poland\\'s gone ahead and provided 18 of the advanced \\nKrab howitzers, which I show a picture of there. This is a self-propelled version \\nof an advanced 155mm gun. It\\'s actually quite an impressive piece of kit. The hull for example, the basic hull \\nis actually a South Korean form that the Poles have re-purposed \\nand built into their design. But they\\'ve managed to train 100 Ukrainian \\nartillery men on this vehicle already, and 18 of them are apparently \\nshipped or in service. And they are due to supply 60 more \\nof these things in the next few months. There was a lot of focus put on the M777 because of \\nits range, its accuracy, its light weight, its mobility. Well, the Krab\\'s got even more range. It\\'s a much more mobile \\nand survivable system, because it\\'s self-propelled \\nit can shoot and scoot. And they\\'re supplying very large numbers \\nof them, 18 already, 60 more on their way. That\\'s comparable to the number of \\nhowitzers that America is providing, let alone other actors like \\nsay, Canada or Australia. If you wanted to be really uncharitable \\nyou could compare this to the shipments of Panzerhaubitzen from \\nGermany or the Netherlands. But we won\\'t go there because I think \\nunpacking German arms deliveries basically requires its own \\nentry and myth-busting video, because there\\'s very loud voices on both \\nextremes that are probably both wrong. But the point is Poland has certainly gone above and beyond in terms \\nof providing these artillery systems. And I guess the point \\nI\\'m trying to get here is not a who\\'s who of every weapon system \\nthat Poland has been willing to provide. It\\'s that there\\'s a unifying \\ntheme here: scale and speed. Every country that has \\nsupplied weapons to Ukraine has gone through a different \\ncycle of political debate. And then after the political \\ndebate and a decision being made, how long does it take for equipment \\nto be delivered, to get there? And then once it\\'s delivered, how long does it take \\nto train the Ukrainians on it and get it to the front? Poland is doing all of these things in much shorter time-lines than a lot \\nof what other people are able to do. Now part of that is because it\\'s on its border, part of that is because \\nit\\'s handing over equipment the Ukrainians are either already \\ntrained on, or can be readily trained on. But whatever the reason, when you \\nlook at certain equipment categories, if you look at confirmed deliveries, Poland \\nhas dominated a number of those categories. 85% of known tank \\nshipments to Ukraine, Poland. 40% of known IFVs, 35% of \\nthe known self-propelled guns. 100% of the air-to-air missiles, \\n30% of the MLRS systems. ... A lot has been made about America\\'s \\nrecent decision to ship HIMARS to Ukraine. As far as I can see only 4 HIMARS \\nsystems have already been confirmed as pre-positioned in Europe \\nand ready to go to Ukraine. Poland\\'s already provided \\n20 Grad rocket systems at least, and will be making every effort \\nto provide more as time goes on. OK, so it\\'s me, so you knew I was going \\nto talk about economics and logistics. But really, it\\'s one of the key reasons (beyond weapons \\nshipments) that Poland really has been critical. Despite the sinking of the Moskva and a lot of \\ntalk about anti-ship missiles, the fact remains the Russian Black Sea Fleet is entirely capable \\nof maintaining a stand-off blockade of Odessa. That is, at the moment if anything \\ncomes out or goes into Ukraine, it\\'s not going out or \\ncoming in by boat. It\\'s taking the train, or it\\'s being \\ndriven on the back of a truck. And that means the rail connections. \\nAnd Ukraine had a very well developed rail system before this conflict and still does, \\ncapable of carrying very, very large volumes. That rail system is more \\nimportant than ever before. So you start looking at the rail \\nconnections into Ukraine start thinking, \"OK, if I\\'m trying to get \\nWestern military support or Western economic and humanitarian \\nsupport in, what route is it going to take?\" Well you might think you go \\nvia Romania into Moldova and across the border \\nfrom Moldova into Ukraine. But the problem there is (and it\\'s not marked \\non this map) along that Moldovan border there\\'s an area that\\'s packed full \\nof Russian and pro-Russian troops. It\\'s called Transnistria. It\\'s \\nessentially an unrecognised state that people were wondering \\nwhether or not Russia plans to link up there and \\npossibly cause problems in Moldova in the event that they\\'re eventually \\nable to take Mykolaiv or Odessa. So you have to imagine that Russian troops doing \\na train inspection on something coming through, might see a bunch of Polish tanks on the back \\nof the train, put two and two together and go, \"Maybe, maybe we\\'re going \\nto turn this one around and not give this one permission \\nto transit. Just, just, just maybe.\" And then you look at the other borders and you \\ngo OK, Hungary has a very, very narrow border, Romania likewise has \\na couple of connections. Poland stands out, and it stands out for \\nmore reasons than this map initially suggests. Not only are there major lines \\nfor Ukraine linking into Poland, there\\'s also the matter of the railway gauge. Ukraine, as a sort of \\npost-Soviet legacy, still overwhelmingly uses the \\nRussian gauge of railway. That\\'s the width of the railway track. You can\\'t drive from different gauges, one \\nto the other, using standard locomotives. Poland is home to a lot of the \\ninfrastructure and some of the few lines that allow trains that \\nare on the Ukrainian gauge to transition over and transload \\nonto the European gauge. This transloading infrastructure is present in a \\nnumber of places on the Polish/Ukrainian border. And I\\'ve included a shot from Google \\nMaps where if you squint hard enough on a big enough screen \\nyou can actually physically see. And the north east of \\nthat screen shot is Ukraine, in the south west of that screenshot \\nis Poland, separated by a waterway. And you can make out the large \\ntransloading and railway yards and the railway lines \\nlinking those two together. Polish railway links are critical. And there\\'s frenzied work going on \\nin Ukraine and Poland at the moment to expand the capabilities and carrying capacity of \\nthese railways and of these transloading stations. Because Ukraine would very much \\nlike more to be able to get in. And the rest of Europe and the world \\ndesperate for, say, Ukrainian grain, is desperate for every ton possible to make it \\nout. Which is why so much work is happening. As painful as it is right now for all those countries \\nthat depend on, for example, Ukrainian grain, one of the primary export \\nroutes, and it\\'s not perfect but one of the few things that they\\'ve \\ngot going for them at the moment, is a railway link that takes it out of \\nwestern Ukraine, ships into Poland, then north by rail through Poland, \\nall the way up to Gdańsk, where it\\'s put on shipping transports in \\nthe Baltic Sea and transported from there. There are other routes, \\nbut that gives you an example of the sort of lifelines that \\nUkraine has available to it. Without this railway infrastructure, \\nwithout these transloading stations, without the fact that Poland has basically \\nallowed NATO to set up shop in its territory and turn entire air bases, \\ntrain stations and entire tracts of land into basically warehouses and \\ncoordination points that collect all of the weapons systems and \\nhumanitarian aid going into Ukraine and then organise their \\nshipment across the border. Without all of that, the lifeline \\nthat is supporting the Ukrainian military and the Ukrainian economy just \\nwouldn\\'t be able to sustain itself. And it probably doesn\\'t surprise you \\nthat Moscow hasn\\'t exactly reacted warmly to Warsaw turning itself into the Amazon \\nPrime of weapons deliveries to Ukraine. Russia was quick to shut the gas off in Poland, \\noil deliveries were halted in April. And you have to think that\\'s a step that \\nwould be out of the question in terms of Russian relations with say Germany, or many \\nof the nations of Central or Western Europe. And it\\'s gone beyond that. Russian diplomatic \\nand economic efforts to pressure Poland have been extensive basically since \\nday one, and have only grown over time. And while no one likes to take Kadyrov or many \\nof the people on Russian state TV seriously, when they do talk about what\\'s next, or \\nexpanding the war in a universe in which they win, the country that they tend to name as next \\nin line for \"denazification\", well it\\'s Poland. And I want to put this into perspective here. When you look at the pain threshold of the \\nvarious allies that Ukraine has in this conflict, and where their red lines for support seem \\nto be, and what\\'s ready to dissuade them. Some countries draw the line at too much \\ninflation in energy prices, or food prices, as a line on how far they are willing \\nto go for support for Ukraine. Others blanch at the idea of having their fossil \\nfuel supplies cut, at least in the near term. Poland\\'s basically said, \"Do your worst.\" \\nAnd that\\'s the stance that they\\'ve taken. They are willing to take the energy \\nembargo, they\\'re willing to take just about any economic retaliation \\nthe Russians throw at them. And the only response has \\nbeen more artillery, more shells, more aid, and a more open \\nhome for Ukrainian refugees. So why does all this matter? That\\'s the question. Why have I decided to do \\na whole video on Poland when most coverage of the war in \\nWestern media barely mentions the country? My first point is that without Poland, \\nUkrainian resistance as we understand it, the war as we understand it now, a relatively slow grinding fight \\nof attrition in the east of Ukraine after the defeat of the thrusts on Kyiv \\nand the push back in Kharkiv, none of that\\'s really possible \\nwithout Polish cooperation. Western weapons deliveries have \\nbeen important, they\\'ve been critical. And those deliveries are very difficult without \\nPolish airspace, Polish rail infrastructure. Polish intelligence is another \\narea that isn\\'t discussed enough. And there\\'s also the important \\nquestion here of political influence. Russian strategy now appears to \\nbe attritional, a slow grinding fight. And in that sort of slow grinding fight, \\nthe only way Russia wins in the long term economically and militarily \\n(I\\'ve talked about this before) is if the will of the Western \\npowers supporting Ukraine falters. Because at the end of the day, \\nif the political will is there, the economic and military resources \\nof the West are far, far greater. So the only thing that allows \\nRussia to win a war of attrition, to leverage its much \\nstronger starting position, (the fact that Russia began with a much stronger \\nmilitary than Ukraine, despite its problems) the only thing that gets them to a winning \\nposition from there in a long drawn-out fight of attrition is if Western political will \\nfalters, or Ukrainian political will falters. So in terms of determining \\nwill Western attitudes falter, will the West drop the ball in Ukraine, \\nwill it decide the cost is too high, it depends how many voices are \\nin the tent and what they\\'re saying. Poland\\'s in the tent and Poland\\'s \\nbasically screaming \"Go to Moscow.\" OK, not that extreme. If there were no \\nnukes they\\'d be screaming \"Go to Moscow.\" Instead they\\'re going to be the ones in the \\nroom screaming \"Back to the 2014 line.\" Or indeed they\\'d probably back Zelenskyy if \\nhe said, \"Throw them out of all of the Donbas.\" The Poles are going to be one of the most \\npersistent voices in favour of supporting Ukraine, of standing up for Ukraine, of supplying \\nmore weapons and more equipment. And because they\\'re in the tent of NATO, \\nbecause they\\'re in the tent of the European Union, and because they\\'re so critical to the \\neastern strategies of both those bodies, they\\'re going to have a voice, \\nthey\\'re going to have some influence. At the end of the day Washington is \\ngoing to do what Washington does, London is going to do what London does, \\nBerlin is going to do what Berlin does. But the Poles are a \\nstrong and persistent voice in favour of continuing \\nthis fight into the long term. And in the end it doesn\\'t really matter \\nfor the purpose of European politics whether the Polish attitude on that point is based \\non cultural kinship with the Ukrainian people, a desire to protect Poland\\'s own security, or just because this is a fantastic \\nchance to punch the Russians in the teeth. (And are you really a Polish government if you deny \\nyourself a chance to punch Russia in the teeth?) In the end that doesn\\'t matter, what\\'s \\ngoing to matter is Polish advocacy and Poland\\'s voice in terms \\nof determining ongoing European and American policy \\ntowards this conflict. And the easy way to \\nI suppose illustrate this in a somewhat ridiculous way, is to \\nflip the entire example on its head. What does the conflict look like \\nin Russian dreamland? And what I mean by this is that over \\nthe years there have been some interesting ideas come out of \\nRussia in terms of Ukraine\\'s fate. Many of them have involved the \\npotential partitioning of the state. Now allegedly, and this is \\nonly allegedly, some years ago the Kremlin did put out soft feelers to \\nWarsaw to basically determine whether, you know, Warsaw would be interested in \\nsome sort of partition of the Ukrainian state. Now that didn\\'t go very well and didn\\'t \\nreceive a very warm reception, allegedly. But as silly as it seems, \\nthe idea is worth reflecting on. Europe is a place where many countries \\nstill have very old clashing territorial claims. But, and this seems very obvious to say, \\nthe nations of Europe in general have agreed that peaceful cooperation, \\nfriendship, economic development, all of these things are far more important than trying to adjust or re-litigate \\nquestions of border disputes. They\\'re more important than revanchism. So whereas Russia is \\nall about revanchism, about denying the right of \\nthe Ukrainian state to exist. Describing it as an \"artificial state\", and trying to \\nre-litigate the questions of border and identity. The Poles aren\\'t willing to stab \\nUkraine in the back for Lviv. They\\'re not. And I\\'m sure that there are some in \\nMoscow who subscribe to very realpolitik, almost 19th century, views of the world in terms \\nof territorial claims and revanchism and empire. I\\'m not sure they\\'re going to be able to really \\nunderstand that. But to us it\\'s obvious. But consider for a moment \\nif it wasn\\'t obvious. A Poland that was supportive of Russia. \\nA Poland that had taken a ... pro-Moscow stance. Even a Poland which had declared \\nnon-intervention in this crisis would have turned all of NATO\\'s efforts, all of Europe\\'s efforts to support \\nand sustain Kyiv on its head. So basically Poland\\'s decision not to basically do Molotov-Ribbentrop \\nPact 2.0, as ridiculous as that idea seems, that concept does allow us to illustrate just how \\ncritical Poland\\'s role has been in this entire thing. That Ukraine\\'s survival, \\nUkraine\\'s ability to fight, basically hinges on Warsaw\\'s \\ndecision to take its current path. And that path is also going to have very significant \\nimplications for the Polish state going forward. The first point to think about is what this \\nmeans for Poland\\'s military capability, because the war in Ukraine \\nhas touched off a very rapid spate of announcements on the \\nmodernisation of the Polish Army. Poland had large stocks of legacy \\nequipment, Warsaw Pact-era equipment. Most that\\'s going to Ukraine, and a lot of it is going \\nto be backfilled with modern Western equipment. Tanks from Britain, tanks from \\nGermany, tanks from America. And at the same time as this new \\nequipment is being brought into backfill, the financial barriers against \\nmodernisation are being removed. In some cases it\\'s because equipment \\nis being provided to support the backfill, in other cases it\\'s because the Polish \\ngovernment is approving additional funds. But you also have to imagine that in terms of \\nNATO military aid and European military aid, Poland is going to be a priority in the \\nnear future because of the importance of sustaining Poland as a military flank \\nagainst an ongoing unstable war zone. We\\'re going to expect more NATO troops, and we have \\nseen more NATO troops move into Polish territory. With that basing comes \\nsecurity assistance, with that basing comes \\nadditional funding assistance. So Poland\\'s military potential is \\nevolving very, very rapidly as a result. They\\'re going to operate Patriot, \\nthey\\'re going to operate F-35, they\\'re going to operate M1A2 SEPV3 tanks, \\nand they\\'re going to operate HIMARS. And not 4 HIMARS systems, \\nnot 6 HIMARS systems, Poland\\'s talking about \\nordering 500 HIMARS systems. And if they had them yesterday, they\\'d \\nprobably get lost by the Ukrainian border. And this has very real implications for the balance \\nof conventional military power going forward. We talked in the video \\non Sweden and Finland about, what adding those \\nnation\\'s militaries to NATO potentially means in terms of the limited \\nwar scenarios between Russia and NATO. Because as I\\'ve said before, total war \\nscenarios usually end up in nuclear fireballs, so it ... doesn\\'t really make that \\nmuch sense either to start one or to waste too much time \\nand sanity talking about them. Poland\\'s modernisation puts a more capable \\nmotivated force on NATO\\'s eastern flank. They all have all of these \\nadvanced weapons systems. And Poland joins Finland and Sweden in terms \\nof being the nations that are closely positioned and capable of intervening quickly \\nin a lot of those limited war scenarios. Poland for example would be there very, \\nvery quickly in the event that an invasion went in against the Baltics in an attempt by \\nRussia to establish a land bridge to Kaliningrad. You have to imagine that Poland \\nwould be there basically at the forefront. And this modernisation of Polish military \\ncapabilities makes it less and less likely that a Russian military, \\nespecially a Russian military that has been heavily depleted by the Ukrainian \\nconflict, is able to conduct that sort of operation. And because they know they can\\'t conduct \\nthat sort of operation, they\\'re less tempted to try. So this is a major improvement in NATO\\'s ability \\nto dissuade limited actions by the Russians. And it also improves Poland\\'s, \\nI suppose voice at the table, their influence on matters \\nof European defence. Because while they won\\'t be \\nEuropean leaders in every area (I don\\'t think the Polish Navy is going to win any \\nprizes relative to, say, the French Navy any time soon) they\\'re still going to have amongst \\nEurope\\'s largest tank and IFV fleets, and they\\'re going to be a valuable \\ncomponent of NATO strategy going forward. Which is going to give Warsaw influence \\nthat far outstrips its economic power. So what does this mean in terms of \\nwider post-war possibilities for Poland? Because as I said, the stakes are pretty high. A victorious Ukraine, that is a Ukraine that \\nis able to generally resist the Russian invasion, that is able to, say, push the territorial \\nboundaries back to pre-February 2022, that is able to eventually \\nbecome an ... EU candidate and finally a full EU member, \\nwell what does that mean for Poland? It means Poland gains an allied state \\nwith a battle-tested army to the east. So Poland is no longer worried about Russian \\nforces pushing against on that part of its border. Instead it\\'s got a solid ally that\\'s in \\nthe same tent, that it can train with, that it can mutually support, [that] it can rely on in \\nthe event of future Russian revanchist ambitions. It\\'s also got another allied voice in the EU. Poland doesn\\'t exactly see \\neye-to-eye with many of the western and central European nations of \\nthe EU, that\\'s just a matter of record. While there are huge common values \\nand common ambitions and commitments to the European project, there are at the same \\ntime also political, legal, cultural differences. Ukraine as a nation, which is more \\nclosely aligned with Poland perhaps than some of the other existing EU members, and this gives Poland a great additional \\nvoice and ally in the European tent. There\\'s also an economic opportunity here, \\npotentially a very large economic opportunity. Once the war is over, \\nUkraine has to be rebuilt. And presuming that EU, \\nor American, or international funds are forthcoming for some sort of \\nMarshall or rebuilding plan for Ukraine, you have to imagine that\\'s going to create \\na whole raft of possibilities for Poland. For Polish construction workers \\nand construction companies. For the Polish logistical network, \\nfor Polish workers and companies because they will be supporting \\nthe logistical supply chains and supporting the efforts in a devastated \\nUkraine to bring it back up to speed. And as Ukraine regenerates ... there are opportunities \\nfor the very closely interlinked Polish economy. And the economic potential \\nof course goes beyond that. It goes to what happens if trade comes \\nacross the Caspian Sea into Odessa and then through Poland and into Europe. \\nThe possibilities are endless. At the same time, Poland in this \\nscenario gains a weakened Russia. A Russia that is less able to threaten it, \\nto influence its politics, to intimidate it. A Russia that is in a diminished \\nposition to provide a security threat. And to go further, to go to \\nthe most extreme example. What is a Russian defeat, an \\nunambiguous Russian defeat, not that I\\'m saying that\\'s going to be the result, \\nbut in the event there\\'s an unambiguous Russian defeat, what does that \\nmean for Lukashenko and Belarus? Now if you play the Uno reverse card \\nand Ukraine solidly loses the war. And Russia is able to strip \\nall the eastern territories away into what is basically \\ntheir idea of Novorossiya. If Kyiv either becomes a technically \\nneutral or a Russian-dominated state, all those benefits basically \\nget turned on their head. There is no reconstruction \\neconomic boom. There is a Ukraine that has been \\npushed into the Russian sphere. There is a great and enlarged Russian or \\nRussian-proxy military threat to the east. All of these advantages get \\nflipped entirely on their head. So Poland\\'s activism and commitment \\nto the conflict makes sense through the lens of their strategy, \\ntheir culture, their economic interests. They\\'re playing for very significant \\npossibilities that go far beyond the change that this would mean \\nfor say Spain, or Italy, or Portugal. European states that are supportive \\nof Ukraine for political reasons, that don\\'t have quite as much on the line \\nas their Polish friends and colleagues do. So in summary. Ukraine certainly benefits from \\nits wide array of supporting allies. Every dollar helps, \\nevery bullet helps, every shell helps. But nations have different \\nlevels of interest and capability, they have different dedications to the \\ncause and different capacity to assist. Poland has both. Poland has the \\ndetermination, the fanaticism of the Baltic states, with a much deeper reserve of weapons \\nand equipment that it\\'s capable of providing. So while American and British aid sort \\nof dominates the anglophone media, I don\\'t think we can forget Poland. \\nIt\\'s the reason I made this video. Poland\\'s role has \\nbeen absolutely critical. They are the reason that Kyiv has been able \\nto fight as hard as it has, as long as it has. And as far as the Poles are \\nconcerned, they\\'re playing for keeps. The immense humanitarian effort \\nsheltering millions of Ukrainians, could be the basis of \\ngoodwill and an alliance that serves Poland incredibly well \\nfor the next half century or more. That tightly binds Poland and Ukraine, \\nthat revolutionises their relationship, and allows them to become allies \\nin the European tent going forward. Or it could become a costly failed investment, all \\ndepending on how the Ukrainian War plays out. Although I\\'ll say that whatever happens, you \\nhave to imagine that for the millions of Ukrainians who have found shelter in Poland where \\nthey thought they had nowhere else to go, if nothing else lasts beyond \\nthe boundaries of this conflict I think Ukrainians will remember this. Alright, so let\\'s do a channel update \\nbefore we close this one out. Firstly a huge thanks. There\\'s \\nbeen really, really good responses to the last few videos, particularly \\nthe last one on corruption. The return to the longer form content \\nappears to have been well received. Now, not every video, not every topic, \\nis going to merit the full 50 minutes. But I\\'ve certainly taken the message home that \\nwhere it is appropriate I\\'m going to speak to time rather than trying to cut myself down to \\n20 or 30 minutes for the sake of popularity. I do have a number of upcoming \\nvideos under consideration. I\\'m looking at the infantry \\nproblem, which is the question of mobilisation and manpower \\non both sides of the conflict. And also looking at something there that \\nI don\\'t think has been dwelt on enough, which is the role of DPR/LPR proxies (so the Donetsk and Luhansk forces) \\nin supporting the Russian invasion. There\\'s a lot to be examined there in \\nterms of the role those forces are playing. And how they help explain \\nthe dichotomy of casualty figures that we\\'re seeing for the Russian side, and \\nthe experiences the Russians are having. I\\'m also looking at doing a \\nmyth-busting and propaganda video. That\\'s been on the cards for a while, \\nbut it\\'s just difficult to shape it up. The problem is there\\'s an \\nawful lot of myths out there. It takes a lot less time to generate \\na lie than it does to thoroughly rebut it. So what I\\'m really looking for is some guidance \\nas to what myths are the most pernicious, the most common, that really deserve \\nto have some time dedicated to them. Like I could focus on \\nthe really out there ones. Like the idea that 20,000 NATO Special Forces \\nsoldiers have been killed in Ukraine so far. That\\'s a legit myth that did the rounds, \\nbut it\\'s also a very niche one. So I\\'m interested in insight from \\npeople into ideas that you think deserve analysis in \\nthat myth-busting video. I also note that I have been \\nasked for a 100 day update, basically a check in on \\nhow the conflict is going. I\\'m reluctant to do that, if only because there \\nis so much uncertainty over how it\\'s all going. And I\\'m not sure I want \\nto step into that zone. But if there\\'s significant \\nencouragement for it, then I can do an update on \\nthings like the economic condition, or mobilisation, or manpower \\nlimitations on both sides. But in terms of analysing the battlefield, I don\\'t \\nthink the information out there is good enough. And I don\\'t think I have the capability to \\ntell you how the battlefield is evolving. In any case, again I did want to \\nput forward my genuine thanks for the immense support that I have \\nreceived, it has made all the difference. I\\'ve had a huge influx of people \\nsending me email content, commenting, engaging, \\nI\\'m thankful for all of it. So please like, comment, subscribe, \\nand I\\'ll see you again shortly.',\n",
       " \"Hi guys, @tatakodzi here. Today I would like to share NG-Poland and JS Poland 2022 highlights with you. It is 6th edition of NG-Poland conference which takes place in Warsaw (capitol city) / Poland. It brings many enthusiasts of Angular and Java Script. Which makes it also attractive for companies who actively are looking for frontend developers profiles. Due to COVID restrictions conference was held in a hybrid model enabling physical and online presence. First day sessions were focused mainly on Angular and TypeScript. Sessions which I liked the most were held by Michael, Alex, Manfred, Deborah, Emma & Minko. I also had a big pleasure watching some polish presenters like Marta or 3 amigos talking about ESLint. ngAwards 2021 went to Vitalia, House of Angular and Lars. Congrats to all and I highly recommend you to google their names. Things which I've missed on NG-Poland were lack of revolutionary topics and lack of clear session difficulty levels in agenda so you can decide on your own participation schedule. There has been some live coding sessions and the coffee breaks have been great moment for networking with the other participants. Apart from regular sessions we could listen to the discussion panel on the future of Angular framework development. As every year there have been some conference gift bags including stickers and NG-Poland t-shirts. According to the JS Poland agenda 2nd day of conference brought us topics related to Java Script, frameworks and libraries using this technology. Sessions which I liked the most were held by Michael, Nir, Stefan, Chris, Gerard and Dawid. JS AWARDS 2021 went to Chris, Stefan and Gerard. Two things which I have remembered after this conference are presentations about pandemia burnout (with family context) affecting your performance and the one about GitHub Copilot and future of AI in software development. As you may imagine there has been some crazy cats and 90's accents I would like to congratulate organisers (Darek and Julita) who despite of hard pandemic situation been able to organize this conference in a perfect way. Let me know in comments if you like this video. See you soon!\",\n",

SOME OF THEM DO NOT KNOW EACH  OTHER. SOME OF THEM ARE STRANGERS, BUT  THEY HAVE BEEN HERE DAY IN AND  DAY OUT DOING JUST WHAT YOU'RE  WATCHING NOW, OFFERING FOOD,  OFFERING DRINKS, OFFERING A HOT  CUP OF COFFEE, OFFERING A HOT  SOUP, TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT  PEOPLE FEEL WELCOME. THERE WAS EVEN A SIGN WHEN WE  FIRST GOT TO THE TRAIN STATION,  ONE OF THE VERY FIRST STOPS THAT YOU END UP AT WHEN YOU LEAVE THE BORDER OF UKRAINE INTO POLAND,  AND THERE, THERE WERE SIGNS UP  THAT SAID, UKRAINIAN, WE ARE  WAITING FOR YOU HERE IN POLAND. WELCOME TO POLAND. SO, IT IS OPEN ARMS FOR MANY  REFUGEES. I DO WANT TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER  LOOK, BECAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT  THIS EARLIER, AT SOME OF THE  OTHER THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON  HERE. SO, WHAT YOU ARE SEEING ARE  TENTS SET UP, AND YOU'VE SEEN  THIS, ANDERSON, IN THE MANY  TIMES THAT YOU HAVE REPORTED  FROM ANY KIND OF DISASTER  SITUATION, RIGHT? YOU'RE SEEING TENTS, AND THESE  TENTS HAVE BEEN SET UP. THEY HAVE BEEN SET UP SO THAT  PEOPLE CAN GET WARM, SO THAT  PEOPLE CAN SLEEP AT SOME POINT  IN TIME. LOOK AT WHAT IS -- I MEAN,  PEOPLE ARE BRINGING WHATEVER  THEY COULD MUSTER. THESE ARE THE MEAGER BELONGINGS  OF FOLKS WHO HAVE LEFT THEIR  ENTIRE LIVES BEHIND AS WE HAVE  SEEN SO MANY TIMES WHEN WAR  COMES TO A COUNTRY, WHEN  REFUGEES ARE CREATED BECAUSE  SOME GREEDY DESPOT WANTS TO TAKE SOMETHING OVER. SO, WE ARE SEEING THIS OVER AND  OVER AGAIN, AND HERE WE ARE  AGAIN, ANDERSON, IN 2022, AND  WAR IS BEING PERPETRATED ON A  PEOPLE WHO DID NOTHING TO  PROVOKE IT. ALL THEY'RE TRYING TO DO NOW IS  SURVIVE AND EVENTUALLY GO HOME. BUT THEY JUST DON'T KNOW WHEN  THAT'S GOING TO BE. >> AND THERE ARE SO MANY -- I  MEAN, THIS IS WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHO HAVE HAD A LONG JOURNEY JUST TO GET TO THAT SPOT. I MEAN, JUST GETTING OUT OF  UKRAINE FOR WOMEN AND CHILDREN  IS EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT. IT CAN TAKE DAYS AND DAYS AND  DAYS. TRAIN RIDES, BUS RIDES, WALKING  LONG DISTANCES IN THE FREEZING  COLD, SLEEPING OUTSIDE AT TIMES. WHEN WE CROSSED OVER FROM THE  BORDER FROM POLAND, I THINK IT  WAS YESTERDAY OR TWO DAYS -- I  GUESS YESTERDAY MORNING, I MEAN, THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE  WAITING. THERE WAS AN ELDERLY MAN WHO  WE'RE TOLD HAD DIED AT THE  BORDER CHECKPOINT FROM MAKING  THE JOURNEY. I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS A HEART  ATTACK OR EXHAUSTION, BUT HE WAS COVERED WITH A TARP. IT IS JUST A CHAOTIC SCENE. I'M WONDERING, WHERE DO THE  PEOPLE GO FROM THERE? ARE UKRAINIANS ALLOWED TO, THEN, GO INTO POLAND? I KNOW THERE WAS A BUS TO TAKE  PEOPLE TO BERLIN FROM GERMAN  VOLUNTEERS. WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM FROM HERE? >> Reporter: I'M GLAD YOU ASKED. LET ME COME OVER HERE AND SEE IF I CAN GET YOU A PICTURE. THE BUSES FOR THE MOST PART HAVE JUST LEFT, BUT IF YOU LOOK JUST  BEHIND ME, YOU'LL SEE, LIKE, A  TRUCK PULLING UP. PEOPLE ARE LITERALLY COMING FROM THEIR HOMES. PEOPLE IN POLAND ARE SAYING,  HEY, DO YOU NEED A RIDE? DO YOU NEED A RIDE TO KRAKOW? DO YOU NEED A RIDE HERE? DO YOU WANT TO COME TO MY HOME  AND STAY WITH ME? THAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS  COUNTRY, SO YES, UKRAINIANS ARE  BEING OFFERED A PLACE TO STAY IN PEOPLE'S HOMES, AND THE  GOVERNMENT IS SAYING, HEY, YOU  CAN COME IN. THEY ARE -- THEY AREN'T EVEN, AT SOME POINTS, CHECKING PAPERS,  AND THEY'RE ALLOWING NOW  CHILDREN ON THEIR OWN TO BE ABLE TO COME OUT OF UKRAINE AND INTO  POLAND, AND YOU JUST TALKED  ABOUT WHAT YOU SAW ON THE  BORDER, AND WE SAW SOMETHING  VERY SIMILAR, WHICH IS  HEARTBREAKING. WE SAW A 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL WHO  SAYS SHE HAD JUST CROSSED OVER  FROM UKRAINE BY HERSELF TO MEET  HER MOTHER WHO HAD COME FROM, I  THINK, BELGIUM, AND SO SHE HAD  SHOWED UP FROM BELGIUM TO MEET  HER DAUGHTER, AND ALL OF A  SUDDEN, I LOOK OVER, AND THE  MOTHER HAS FAINTED. NO PULSE. SHE HAD NO -- SHE WASN'T  BREATHING. THERE ARE MEDICS THERE FROM  ISRAEL WHO HAD SHOWN UP TO  VOLUNTEER FROM AN ORGANIZATION  THAT'S SIMILAR TO DOCTORS  WITHOUT BORDERS CALLED RESCUERS  WITHOUT BORDERS, AND THEY WERE  LITERALLY WORKING ON THIS WOMAN  ON THE FREEZING COLD GROUND AND  TRYING TO REVIVE HER. AND BY GOD'S GRACE, SHE WAS  REVIVED. THE MEDICS GOT HER BREATHING  AGAIN. SHE HAD A VERY LIGHT PULSE, BUT  THE DAUGHTER IS STANDING THERE  AND WONDERING WHAT SHE'S  SUPPOSED TO DO. YOU CAN SEE THE PANIC AND THE  HEARTACHE, AND SHE'S CRYING AND  TALKING ON THE PHONE, TRYING TO  FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO NOW  BECAUSE THEY'RE TAKING HER  MOTHER TO THE HOSPITAL. AN AMBULANCE CAME ABOUT 30  MINUTES LATER, AND THE  DAUGHTER'S STANDING THERE,  GOING, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. WHAT DO I DO? MY MOTHER -- I WANT TO GO HOME. SO, IT'S A REALLY, REALLY,\",\n",

       " \"hello guys welcome to another vlog so\\xa0\\ntoday i'm going on a road trip to Toruń  i came from wroclaw  by train to Bydgoscz \\xa0\\nand from Bydgoscz  we're driving to Toruń  and\\xa0\\xa0 yeah so come along with me let's explore\\xa0\\nToruń  uh another thing that happened\\xa0\\xa0 to me was yesterday was friday the 13th\\xa0\\nso the forces of friday the 13th were on\\xa0\\xa0 i bought the tickets i tried i forgot to buy\\xa0\\nthe tickets earlier and when i decided to buy\\xa0\\xa0 the tickets uh there were no available seats but\\xa0\\nyou could still pay to stand literally so i paid\\xa0\\xa0 and i rushed this morning to the train station\\xa0\\nand when i got there i just entered any wagon and\\xa0\\xa0 i sat down on a particular chair and i was just\\xa0\\nhoping that this person doesn't come but i stayed\\xa0\\xa0 for a couple of minutes and then the controller\\xa0\\nwho checks the tickets came and he had to ask for\\xa0\\xa0 my ticket so when i showed him he said no this is\\xa0\\nfirst class you're not supposed to be first class\\xa0\\xa0 so from there i had to be transferred to i had to\\xa0\\nmove by myself anyway i kept on moving looking for\\xa0\\xa0 seats it was just a rough ride to be very honest\\xa0\\nwith you so make sure you book your tickets ahead\\xa0\\xa0 of time do not be like me but for now let's drive\\xa0\\nto toronto i think from because the run is about\\xa0\\xa0 50 kilometers so this drive should take us like\\xa0\\none hour approximately give or take uh yeah everything feels so abstract yeah it's complicated\\xa0\\xa0 what you say the way you act well\\xa0\\nit makes me so confused i don't know\\xa0\\xa0 what to do tauren is located in the north central\\xa0\\npart of poland it has its nicknames as the\\xa0\\xa0 gingerbread city or the copernicus down and you're\\xa0\\ngoing to find out why so our first stop today is\\xa0\\xa0 at the sanctuary of the blessed virgin mary and\\xa0\\nlet's have a look and see what it looks like okay so now we're going to park palmy naruto so\\xa0\\nnational memory park the national memory park\\xa0\\xa0 or the national remembrance park was opened in\\xa0\\nhonor of those who risked their lives to save the\\xa0\\xa0 jews in poland during the second world war and on\\xa0\\nevery tab we have the inscription of their names okay so basically here we have sons of\\xa0\\nour homeland you can see the names of\\xa0\\xa0 the different people who have been remembered\\xa0\\nin this park like i said every single pillar has\\xa0\\xa0 names inscribed here and let's go to\\xa0\\nthe middle and have a look from there\\xa0\\xa0 i feel like at this point i need to\\xa0\\nbe playing like the polish anthem so over here we have pictures\\xa0\\nfrom the second world war so basically that's what the pack of memory is up next we're going to explore the city of\\xa0\\nturin and would start from the universities\\xa0\\xa0 here in turin so first of all we are at\\xa0\\nwsg so there's a campus here in tehran\\xa0\\xa0 for their architecture and nursing so\\xa0\\nright now i'm at the nursing campus so let's go inside and have a look and see what\\xa0\\nis done here so they recently started out their\\xa0\\xa0 nursing program in english so let's\\xa0\\ngo inside and see what it's like\\xa0\\xa0 wsg university recently started its nursing\\xa0\\ndegree in english where students get\\xa0\\xa0 taught all the modules and with over 2\\xa0\\n300 hours of hospital practice to make\\xa0\\xa0 sure that the end of the day a graduate\\xa0\\nof nursing from this university becomes\\xa0\\xa0 a well-rounded nurse and is ready to take on the\\xa0\\nworld as this degree is internationally recognized what's your weakness the next school we are\\xa0\\nheading to is the ncu so this is the nicolas\\xa0\\xa0 copernicus university that's in english\\xa0\\nlanguage and of course in polish this\\xa0\\xa0 is universitat michael wire corpenicar so this\\xa0\\nuniversities is one of the biggest universities\\xa0\\xa0 here in toront and it offers courses from\\xa0\\nchemistry nursing medicine pharmacy management\\xa0\\xa0 and all other courses the university campus is\\xa0\\nhuge as you can see so i'm just going to show\\xa0\\xa0 you around because of course i can't get inside\\xa0\\nbecause i do not have access to this university\\xa0\\xa0 like other cities the tram and the buses is\\xa0\\nthe mode of transportation in turin so up next\\xa0\\xa0 we're headed for the next university\\xa0\\nwhich is wsb university here in turn\\xa0\\xa0 as you can see there is a lot of plantation\\xa0\\na lot of trees so the air here is fresh\\xa0\\xa0 i like the city as well so let's just keep\\xa0\\ngoing okay so now we are at vishaskova\\xa0\\xa0 bankovi so this is wsb tauren\\xa0\\nso this is the toronto campus\\xa0\\xa0 and there we have it of course i don't have access\\xa0\\nto going to the universities so we're showing you\\xa0\\xa0 what it looks like on the outside with a lot of\\xa0\\nuniversity comes a lot of students tehran is a\\xa0\\xa0 student city and in this city of course we have\\xa0\\nstudent jobs available to students to work so i\\xa0\\xa0 was able to check out the prices of dormitories in\\xa0\\nthe city and it's within 520 to 700 000 per month\\xa0\\xa0 depending on the kind of room that you're looking\\xa0\\nto get of course there are also companies here in\\xa0\\xa0 toronto opening up we have some i.t companies\\xa0\\nand we have other companies so up next we're\\xa0\\xa0 headed to the city center the old town this is\\xa0\\nwhere we are going to explore next so let's go okay so now of course we are in\\xa0\\nold town so i headed for venac so this is what the season looks like everything well it makes me so confused i\\xa0\\ndon't know what to do anymore is known as copernicus town because this\\xa0\\nis where the astronomer nicolas copernicus\\xa0\\xa0 was born now nicolas copernicus is the guy that\\xa0\\nproposed that all the planets were in orbit around\\xa0\\xa0 the sun so if you do not know this i think you\\xa0\\nshould go back to study physics okay i'm joking\\xa0\\xa0 so yeah my god guys the temperature is so hot like\\xa0\\nso so hot but we move so i got these postcards\\xa0\\xa0 as always for my postcard collection so here we\\xa0\\ngo i'm heading into one of the gingerbread spots jiren is famous for chirinski\\xa0\\nbernicki so this is the turian\\xa0\\xa0 gingerbread they even have a museum\\xa0\\nfor the gingerbread can you imagine\\xa0\\xa0 so in almost every corner here in the city center\\xa0\\nwe have a shop where they sell piraneki so this\\xa0\\xa0 is like this is gingerbread so taronski\\xa0\\ngingerbread so the gingerbread from tauren\\xa0\\xa0 so that's what thorin is known for they produce\\xa0\\na lot of gingerbread and i got myself a lot of so gingerbread yeah it's complicated what\\xa0\\nyou say so we're headed for vistula river\\xa0\\xa0 apparently we have a vistula festival going\\xa0\\non there so let's go and see what it's about oh basically this was how it looked\\xa0\\nin the old this is how it looks now\\xa0\\xa0 and this is it although i don't have a full\\xa0\\nview of this because if you want to get this you\\xa0\\xa0 need to go all the way to the other side of the\\xa0\\nriver which i clearly cannot go to right now but i think you want it too hurts to oh you smile like a dagger hit me okay so we have this church right around the\\xa0\\ncorner here in the city center where nicolas\\xa0\\xa0 copernicus was christian so this\\xa0\\nwas where he had this christian in\\xa0\\xa0 so now we are going into the church so so this was when nicolas go by nick was baptized so apparently this is a dragon and we are\\xa0\\nat smok taronski and if you remember from\\xa0\\xa0 the krakow vlog we had smok krakowski so\\xa0\\nthis is the dragon of thuron and according\\xa0\\xa0 to them on the 13th of 1746 which apparently\\xa0\\nyesterday was 13th of august a soldier's wife\\xa0\\xa0 and a carpenter's wife said they saw a dragon\\xa0\\nin toronto so here we go here is the dragon so guys my battery is about to die but let's keep\\xa0\\nit going i hope that i'm able to still capture\\xa0\\xa0 part of the city before this battery goes\\xa0\\noff and i'll be headed back to brazil\\xa0\\xa0 in exactly two hours so let's see what we can\\xa0\\ndo with the remaining 10 percent of this battery\\xa0\\xa0 okay so now we are going to the castle of ruins\\xa0\\nand uh it starts here yeah starts here and it\\xa0\\xa0 goes all the way down there so let's go okay\\xa0\\nso this is part of the castle as you can see\\xa0\\xa0 part of the wall that still remains it's rains\\xa0\\nthis is what it is there is another building right\\xa0\\xa0 beside it which was also made of brick so it looks\\xa0\\nas if it's the same but it isn't this is the main\\xa0\\xa0 one and we also have some broken pieces of bricks\\xa0\\nthere so part of the castle that was destroyed so we have the river still flowing through here this is all part of the ruins they've of\\xa0\\ncourse built other things around it but\\xa0\\xa0 it's this used to be the castle you have a football pitch down the side of the first of them this is all part of its part of the castle this is the whole turn yeah so still the rain castle and vistula rivers outside there over there i'll discuss some life's endurance so now obviously someone has built a casino\\xa0\\ninside the castle still here marine castle back in the day there was a magazine column\\xa0\\nwhich was for a cartoon character called\\xa0\\xa0 professor felutak and he had a friendly dog\\xa0\\ncalled phyllis and now we have the monument of\\xa0\\xa0 phyllis sitting in the city center\\xa0\\nso this is a dog with a hat and an\\xa0\\xa0 umbrella and you would hardly\\xa0\\nmiss it in the old town so guys i'm back in bit gosh and i\\xa0\\nam here if you remember from the big\\xa0\\xa0 vlog i would show you shortly so when i first\\xa0\\ncame i took a picture here and here as well\\xa0\\xa0 but there was no water in this

for\\xa0\\nwatching the vlog do not forget to like\\xa0\\xa0 share subscribe and i'll see\\xa0\\nyou guys in the next one bye\",\n",
       " 'Kielce Kielce is the capital of the Świętokrzyskie province in the southeast of Poland, located about 180 km south of the capital Warsaw. Kielce is on the list of the cities of Poland on the seventeenth place with about 200,000 inhabitants.',\n",
       " \"Over the years I've been making videos, a lot of people have got in touch\\nto tell me that in Warsaw, in Poland, the tap water quality is tested\\nand controlled by clams. They said that the city constantly runs a sample of its tap water\\npast some mollusks. And those are filter feeders,\\nso if there's a contaminant in the water, they will instinctively close. Sensors attached to them\\nwill detect that and raise the alarm. And I didn't believe it. It seemed too weird to me. And all the articles that I could find\\nabout it seemed dodgy, somehow. They just set off red flags\\nin the research parts of my brain. There is a very arty Polish documentary\\nabout the system, and a lot of sites repost that film’s claims\\nwithout even mentioning the source, just as a “look at this\\nfunny thing off in Poland!”. It felt like it could be a misinterpreted\\nor mistranslated joke, or even a deliberate hoax by a filmmaker\\nthat got out of control, and that the English speaking world was just believing it\\nbecause it was quirky and harmless enough. There have been plenty of fake\\nthings like that spread about in the past, accidentally or otherwise. Or maybe the clam-sensors did exist,\\nbut it was a brief experiment that never went anywhere. Well, I'm now here in Warsaw,\\non a famous building in the middle of the river, with a Polish\\nspeaking team showing me around. There is a lot of stuff we are not allowed\\nto film here for security reasons. Inside here is critical infrastructure. Plus, it is far too noisy down there\\nfor me to talk, but I'm happy to report that yes,\\nthe clams are real. They actually do protect Warsaw, but the story's a little more\\ncomplicated than that. IN POLISH: The important thing is: those clams aren't\\nthe only protection. They're not even the main part. This is still a modern\\nwater treatment system, with 21st century sensors and\\ndetectors to keep everyone safe. This is part of a defense in depth,\\none part of an early warning system, one more alarm that can go off, like an airport that uses\\nexplosive sniffing dogs... but also electronic detectors. The technical term\\nfor this is “biomonitoring”, and it turns out from more research that\\nthis isn't the only place that does it. There are other water companies in Poland\\nthat have similar setups, plus one in Minnesota, USA,\\nand probably more that I haven't found. At which point I think I can say that:\\nyes, the red flag in my head was wrong. The clams in this building\\nreally do help protect Warsaw.\",\n",
       " 'AMNA NAWAZ: A wave of hostility towards LGBTQ\\npeople in Poland has alarmed officials and led the American ambassador there to denounce\\nconservative Polish newspapers for stoking hatred in its campaign for so-called LGBT-free\\nzones. Those fears were realized this weekend, as\\na mob of right-wing Poles attacked a Pride March in the town of Bialystok, one of several\\ndistricts that have declared themselves to be LGBT-free. From Bialystok in Eastern Poland, special\\ncorrespondent Malcolm Brabant reports. MALCOLM BRABANT: \"God, honor, motherland,\"\\nthey chanted. Wearing obscene anti-gay T-shirts, some hard-core\\nright-wingers were intent on violence. Following their lead, thousands of people\\nfrom Bialystok, including senior citizens, lambasted marchers protesting against the\\nsudden rise of so-called LGBT-free zones. Among those they tried to intimidate, Malgorzata\\nMroz. MALGORZATA MROZ, LGBTQ Activist (through translator):\\nIt makes me sad that people claim those LGBTQ-free zones in Poland, because me, as a bisexual\\nand also Polish person, I would really love to feel welcome in every single place in this\\ncountry. MALCOLM BRABANT: The marchers were vastly\\noutnumbered, and police protection was essential. Gay activists claim they have replaced refugees\\nas Poland\\'s main hate figures. MALGORZATA MROZ: I am scared a bit. I have tear gas with me. So, yes, as you can see, they basically shout\\n\"Get the (EXPLETIVE DELETED) out of here\" to me and to other people like me. So I can\\'t feel welcome in my country. MALCOLM BRABANT: As the hostile mood intensified,\\nthe police struggled to defend stragglers separated from the main march. The mob set off in pursuit of one small group\\nof gay pride campaigners seeking safety. But they spotted police pinning down a hard-liner,\\nand the first skirmish of the afternoon began. Police arrested 30 people. This exemplified the hatred and intolerance\\nthat concerns the U.S. ambassador and the openly gay deputy mayor of Warsaw, who compared\\nit to the behavior of the Nazis in the Second World War. The issue of gay rights has been bubbling\\nbeneath the surface in Poland for years. But, recently, it\\'s just exploded and gone\\nto the forefront of the political agenda. And this issue has placed Poland into conflict\\nwith mainstream Europe. When Poland\\'s populist Law and Justice Party\\ncame to power in 2015, it declared ambitions to Christianize the European Union. In towns like Bialystok, they abhor what they\\nregard as mainstream Europe\\'s decadent values. At Parliament in Warsaw, influential law and\\njustice politician Zdzislaw Krasnodebski said Europe favored constitutions, but was hypocritical\\nwhen it came to Poland. ZDZISLAW KRASNODEBSKI, European Parliament\\nMember: Our Constitution in the Article 18 states the marriage is only between a man\\nand a woman. For me, it\\'s very interesting that, in this\\ncase, there\\'s no interest in what actually our constitution is talking about. MALCOLM BRABANT: Government critics say such\\narguments have emboldened protesters, like Lukasz Marcinkiewicz, who is studying medicine\\nin Bialystok. LUKASZ MARCINKIEWICZ, Medical Student: It\\nmakes me sad when I see a situation where we have two people, two men together or two\\nwomen together, and they declare love for each other. There is no biological possibility for them\\nto have a child. So I realize that this is not what families\\nshould look like. I strongly support the model where there is\\none woman, one man, and babies. KAMIL SIENICKI, All Poland Youth Movement\\n(through translator): We think that LGBTQ movements have a very long tradition of profanity\\ntowards state symbols. They turned Poland\\'s national red-and-white\\nflag into a white rainbow flag and desecrate Catholic and Christian symbols. MALCOLM BRABANT: He has in his sights Daniel\\nRycharski, an artist who wears prayer beads made of the blood of homosexuals and who portrays\\nsaints as gay icons. DANIEL RYCHARSKI, Artist (through translator):\\nWhat is going on around the LGBT community appalls me, the fact that the governing party\\nuses us as electoral fuel, because of the fact that the government works closely with\\nthe church, and the church is its authority. The Catholic Church\\'s teaching says it explicitly. You could say it has incited hatred against\\nLGBT people. MALCOLM BRABANT: The anti-gay sermons of some\\npriests are frequently rabid. Wieslaw Dawidowski, who leads Poland\\'s Order\\nof Saint Augustine is a man of peace. But, on this issue, he says he\\'s neither moderate\\nnor liberal. FATHER WIESLAW DAWIDOWSKI, Order of Saint\\nAugustine: I would quote Pope Francis. And I would say, here, I\\'m not a judge. And I cannot judge people. If people want to live this way of live, all\\nright, they live this way of life with full consequences. MALCOLM BRABANT: Thirty miles away from Bialystok\\nis rustic, God-fearing Kulesze Koscielne, where 90 percent voted for the ruling party. ELZBIETA MIERZWINSKA, Poland (through translator):\\nWhat\\'s new isn\\'t always good. And Poland always stood firmly on tradition,\\nreligion, right? KAZIMIERZ TRZASKA, Poland (through translator):\\nI would find some remote islands. I would take gay men to one island and lesbians\\nto the other. Let them live there. MALCOLM BRABANT: Still inspired by the conservative\\nvision of the late Polish Pope John Paul II, the Catholic Church is engaged in a battle\\nfor Europe\\'s identity. FATHER WIESLAW DAWIDOWSKI: This is a certain\\npivotal moment in our relationship. I think the old Europe, which is called the\\nold lady, which is a dying Europe, by the way, has to redefine what she really wants. And it\\'s the question of the Brussels elites. It is also the question of the church elites. What is this we want in Europe in the future,\\nthe issues that concern human values? MALCOLM BRABANT: \"Freedom, equality and tolerance,\\'\\nchanted the pride marchers. They yearn for the right to have same-sex\\nmarriages. But given the levels of prejudice in Poland\\nright now, that looks like an impossible dream. For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I\\'m Malcolm Brabant\\nin Bialystok.',\n",
       " \"Hello and welcome to Poland. My name is\\nPaweł and let's start another episode of 3P and today we will talk about\\nPolish names For most of the time children in Poland\\nwere given names of Saints. As Poland is very religious country most of parents\\nwere baptizing their children and even the communist period that members of\\nparty baptized their children. So name in Poland is very important and meaningful\\nand you also got your Saint patron. There are many names which are easy to\\ntranslate like for example mine. Pawel in English is Paul, Marek is Mark. Some\\nsounds not too similar like for example Jerzy is English\\nGeorge. But sometimes they are almost the same like Adam. But there are also some\\nnames which are typically Polish. For example Stanisław. Stanisław was a bishop\\nof Krakow in 1000 and in 1079 after argue with the King\\nhe was killed. Some would say: he was murdered, some would say that he was\\nexecuted by the King. But then the legend says that his body\\nwas hacked into pieces then they threw it into a pool but miraculously it were\\nintegrated and he became a saint patron of Poland. Today\\nI would say that in almost every Polish family you can find someone with that\\nname. In United States where there is a big Polish community you can find a lot\\nof churches which are dedicated to st. Stanisław.   St. Wojciech the first Polish saint.\\nHis name is not translating into English in some older documents like for example\\nbaptismal records you can find it as Adalbertus. Have you ever heard it?\\nOf course not. No one is using that name When Wojciech was emigrating from\\nPoland sometimes his name was changed into Albert sometimes into a George. There are many names which are like tongue twister. For example Grzegorz, Krzysztof,Przemysław, Katarzyna or you can try Zdzisław. Now it's your turn. Here we're in the medieval\\nDominicans monastery. They are in Krakow thanks to Saint Jacek. Jacek is\\nanother Polish name what is not translating well into English. Hiacynt - I don't think it sounds well. Jacek is also the only Polish Saint whose\\nstatue you can find in a st. Peter's Square in Vatican. But when he came to\\nKrakow in 1200 when he started organizing the monastery he first built\\nthe refectory what is a dining room. Then there was a church. Sso we can say what\\nwas the most important food or the prayer. They've started from food and even\\nnowadays it's used by around 100 monks who are still living here. But Saint\\nJacek is also a saint patron of pierogi. Pierogi probably the most famous polish\\ndish. And we have Saint patrons for almost everything in Poland but about\\nthat we'll talk in another episode. Everyone called my grandmother Maria but\\nespecially in 1800 and 1900 priests didn't want to give that\\nname dedicated to God's Mother as a to Saint name to girls. So they were\\nbaptized as Marianna and it can be a bit confusing when in different documents\\nyour name is mixed. Like my grandmother she had documents with Maria and some\\nwith Marianna. Adam Mickiewicz about a kid we\\nwould say little Adaś. We are by the statue of that great poet and you\\ncan remember it from the last episode when we've met on the Main Square in\\nKrakow. Adam Mickiewicz by the way never been to Krakow. But he created and\\nnamed Grażyna. Grażyna was a very, very common name in generation of my\\nparents. But priests when they were asked to baptize a girl with that name: they\\nsaid not really because there is no saint like that.  And they gave the name\\nMaria. Little Grażyna was finding her real name Maria in her ID when she got\\nfirst real documents. What would be life without parting. If you want to\\nremember birthdays of all your friends it can be quite hard. But in Poland\\nespecially here on the South is much easier when you are bringing presents\\ngifts flowers to your friends for their name day. Name day is the day when we are\\ncelebrating a saint patron. And a lot of people in Poland can remember some dates\\nof the most famous Saints. Like for example Barbara - December 4th,\\nst. Nicholas - December 6th, December 24th it's Adam and Eve. And then ladies\\nselling flowers here on the main square are bringing them to the statue of Adam\\nMickiewicz. The last thing what I want to tell\\nyou about Polish names is: that if you take our ID you will find a family name\\nand two given names. Most of us officially are using two names. And if\\nyou know translation of your name into Polish please leave it in a comment. And\\nthe Polish word for today is Imię, Imię its name in Polish. Thank you for\\nwatching. Please remember to subscribe and turn on notifications and see you in\\nthe next episode. Bye\",\n",

       " \"crazy level of fitness that some people have\\xa0\\nand it's showing us just how lazy we are\\xa0\\xa0 yeah very cold my fingers get very red immediately\\xa0\\ncolder than if you would put your hand directly\\xa0\\xa0 into snow this is colder what's up guys welcome\\xa0\\nback to the channel today we are exploring the\\xa0\\xa0 amazing lake of Morskie Oko in tatra national park\\xa0\\nand we couldn't be more excited we just came in\\xa0\\xa0 and we are ready to explore so let's go if\\xa0\\nyou want to come here from zakopane and you\\xa0\\xa0 don't have your own car that's no problem at all\\xa0\\nthere's public buses commuting to the Morskie Oko\\xa0\\xa0 entrance on a very very frequent level and it's\\xa0\\na 15 Złoty per person to come here and then the\\xa0\\xa0 entrance itself at the moment is eight Złoty per\\xa0\\nperson but you can pay with card so don't worry\\xa0\\xa0 and those buses that naomi just mentioned they\\xa0\\nleave from the main bus station in zakopane center\\xa0\\xa0 every 10 minutes now we are here it's nine\\xa0\\no'clock in the morning and there's already lots\\xa0\\xa0 of tourists here but we cannot wait to get inside\\xa0\\nit's around two hours of a walk from the entrance\\xa0\\xa0 of tatra national park to the lake itself we are\\xa0\\nalready greeted with some stunning nature here\\xa0\\xa0 something to keep in mind when you come into the\\xa0\\ntatra national park and you're headed towards\\xa0\\xa0 Morskie Oko there's plenty of people with\\xa0\\nhorse carriages that are more than willing\\xa0\\xa0 to take you all the way to Morskie Oko itself you\\xa0\\njust have to pay them in cash if you do want to do\\xa0\\xa0 that so if you do want to take a horse carriage to\\xa0\\nMorskie Oko and you don't want to do the two-hour\\xa0\\xa0 trail there i would bring some cash with you i'm\\xa0\\nnot too sure how much it is exactly but i do know\\xa0\\xa0 that you can bargain them down i've heard anywhere\\xa0\\nfrom 50 to 80 Złoty to get there per person the\\xa0\\xa0 trail that leads towards Morskie Oko it\\xa0\\nis actually a paved kind of like a road\\xa0\\xa0 and cars and stuff like that do drive past\\xa0\\nyou as you're walking along so keep that in mind\\xa0\\xa0 it is not like a totally wild trail so\\xa0\\nit's a little bit easier on your feet\\xa0\\xa0 also something worth mentioning the\\xa0\\nnature here that is surrounding this road\\xa0\\xa0 you are basically incredibly thick trees cover\\xa0\\nboth sides of the trail so you don't have that\\xa0\\xa0 much of an open view on too much nature yet but\\xa0\\napparently when you get to the lake that changes\\xa0\\xa0 so we are only about 20 minutes into this hike\\xa0\\nright now and we cannot wait to get further in to\\xa0\\xa0 the national park itself if there is one reason\\xa0\\nfor you to come and visit zakopane this is it\\xa0\\xa0 it's the nature and we are here and we cannot\\xa0\\nwait and we are luckily blessed with beautiful\\xa0\\xa0 blue sky weather today as well it's actually a\\xa0\\nlittle bit warm we wore slightly heavier clothes\\xa0\\xa0 because we were expecting it to be a little\\xa0\\nbit chilly because it's so early in the morning\\xa0\\xa0 but no we're already starting to sweat oh\\xa0\\nmy god you guys kind of halfway i think um\\xa0\\xa0 we have this absolutely beautiful view onto the\\xa0\\nmountains and there's actually still snow there\\xa0\\xa0 and if you're here in the area you can kind of\\xa0\\nif you look to the left walking towards Morskie Oko\\xa0\\xa0 looking to the left i think it's pretty\\xa0\\nmuch all slovakia slovakia right yeah\\xa0\\xa0 and there's still loads of snow in the area\\xa0\\nthere which is so beautiful so we just came across\\xa0\\xa0 some stunning water rapids or waterfalls the\\xa0\\nwater was really rushing down and you can capture\\xa0\\xa0 some incredible sounds there and i believe it\\xa0\\nwas called Potok Roztoka if i'm pronouncing\\xa0\\xa0 that correctly but it is a beautiful stop along\\xa0\\nthe trail towards Morskie Oko now we're going to\\xa0\\xa0 continue on this beautiful trail and it's actually\\xa0\\ngetting more and more beautiful as we walk along along the way we took a right now and the road\\xa0\\nkind of splits so both streets go towards the\\xa0\\xa0 Morskie Oko lake but one of them is on the normal\\xa0\\nstreet that is just usually like paved as a normal\\xa0\\xa0 street that cars drive on basically\\xa0\\nseems to continue on for the horses\\xa0\\xa0 for the carriages and this one\\xa0\\nhere seems to go a little bit more\\xa0\\xa0 through the forest and the street is a little\\xa0\\nbit more challenging so depending on your own\\xa0\\xa0 capabilities you definitely have both options\\xa0\\nand we chose the more difficult looking one\\xa0\\xa0 it's worth mentioning as well guys that\\xa0\\xa0 all along the trail you will have porta-potties so\\xa0\\ndon't worry you don't have to wander off into the\\xa0\\xa0 woods you do have porta potties all along the\\xa0\\nway i would actually suggest you not to wander\\xa0\\xa0 off into the woods because there was a sign\\xa0\\nat the entrance warning bears so if you have\\xa0\\xa0 to go to the toilet make sure to use the porta\\xa0\\npotties and don't walk into the woods by yourself\\xa0\\xa0 we're taking the alternative route\\xa0\\nyou're kind of as fast as the horses\\xa0\\xa0 and that's a bit scary it was very close the horsey got a little bit angry there i don't\\xa0\\nthink that we caused it ah luke said it slipped\\xa0\\xa0 okay for a second i thought that we caused\\xa0\\nthe panic and but it's kind of a race now\\xa0\\xa0 to the top when you take the alternative route\\xa0\\nyou're kind of overtaking the same carriage over\\xa0\\xa0 and over and then on the paved parts the horses\\xa0\\novertake you again i hope that that horsey is okay\\xa0\\xa0 it's really crazy we are currently around an hour\\xa0\\nand a half now into this hike and there's people\\xa0\\xa0 running past us in both directions some\\xa0\\npeople running up some people running down\\xa0\\xa0 crazy level of fitness that some people have\\xa0\\nand it's showing us just how lazy we are\\xa0\\xa0 at least we're not taking the horses so right\\xa0\\nhere is where the horse carriages come to the\\xa0\\xa0 stop it's worth noting that the horse carriages do\\xa0\\nnot bring you all the way to Morskie Oko i believe\\xa0\\xa0 we still have roughly another kilometer or\\xa0\\nso to go before we get to the lake itself\\xa0\\xa0 so if you are planning on taking the horse all the\\xa0\\nway there you will still have to do some walking\\xa0\\xa0 but you are greeted at the end\\xa0\\nof the horse carriage trail\\xa0\\xa0 with absolutely stunning snow-capped\\xa0\\nmountains in the distance\\xa0\\xa0 and all of the nature around here is truly amazing\\xa0 one of a kind there's a national park for a\\xa0\\xa0 reason and i cannot i can understand paying an\\xa0\\nentrance fee into somewhere as beautiful as this also at the end of the horse carriage trail you\\xa0\\nhave a restaurant too i believe actually a few\\xa0\\xa0 restaurants bistros stuff like that so you do have\\xa0\\xa0 a selection of food available if you're like us\\xa0\\nand you don't bring food with you we are actually\\xa0\\xa0 we are actually hiking fasted at the moment\\xa0\\nso we haven't had any food just yet we just\\xa0\\xa0 brought water with us but i'm sure on\\xa0\\nthe way back down we're gonna stop off\\xa0\\xa0 at one of these restaurants smells like they\\xa0\\nhave some pretty amazing food we are getting\\xa0\\xa0 closer and closer to the area where there's\\xa0\\nstill snow and i'm kind of wondering if we're\\xa0\\xa0 gonna get the chance to actually touch some\\xa0\\nsnow that would be really amazing we actually\\xa0\\xa0 brought the drone with us today thinking we\\xa0\\nwere gonna get some epic nature drone shots\\xa0\\xa0 but there's signs everywhere at the entrance of\\xa0\\nthe national park saying no drones allowed seems\\xa0\\xa0 like every time we bring the drone with us we're\\xa0\\nnot allowed to fly it and every time we forget our\\xa0\\xa0 drone we're allowed to fly it but uh yeah a little\\xa0\\nbit of a shame we're gonna try and capture as many\\xa0\\xa0 beautiful shots as we can though with this little\\xa0\\nbad boy here oh my god you guys we made it all the\\xa0\\xa0 way up to the lake now and check this out\\xa0\\nyou have a stunning view up here and it is\\xa0\\xa0 a little bit colder actually up here than it was\\xa0\\non the trail itself because the cold mountain air\\xa0\\xa0 kind of comes down directly from the mountain\\xa0\\njust goes over the lake and if you're standing\\xa0\\xa0 here obviously you're going to stand directly in\\xa0\\nthe cold wind up here you also have like a little\\xa0\\xa0 restaurant situation obviously toilets bars cafe\\xa0\\nwhatever you might need when you get all the way\\xa0\\xa0 up here but we're just going to enjoy the lake\\xa0\\nfor a while and then maybe get something to eat\\xa0\\xa0 because we kind of deserve it after this hike so\\xa0\\nMorskie Oko is indeed the largest lake\\xa0\\xa0 in the tatra mountains and it apparently\\xa0\\nwas sculpted during the last ice age due to\\xa0\\xa0 falling glaciers it's incredibly beautiful and\\xa0\\nyou can see a ton of snow off in the distance so apparently the lake itself can\\xa0\\nbe frozen all the way into may\\xa0\\xa0 and it's may right now and it is actually pretty\\xa0\\nmuch surrounded by ice have a look at this this is going to be this is going to be\\xa0\\na very slippery experience i am wearing\\xa0\\xa0 a pair of chucks as you can see so yeah\\xa0\\ncurrently walking on ice and it's may\\xa0\\xa0 what do you think guys you\\xa0\\nactually have the crunch under your\\xa0\\xa0 feet when you walk like as if it's kind\\xa0\\nof january or february it's super nice weirdly enough even though there is so much\\xa0\\nsnow i mean it does get a little bit colder\\xa0\\xa0 up here because of the wind obviously\\xa0\\nbut there is so much snow still here\\xa0\\xa0 but yet it doesn't feel necessarily cold\\xa0\\nand the sun still kind of warms you up\\xa0\\xa0 as you crunch through the snow it's so nice i\\xa0\\ndon't think that words can truly or accurately\\xa0\\xa0 describe just the sheer beauty\\xa0\\nthat is this lake of Morskie Oko\\xa0\\xa0 the snow just adds a whole different dimension to\\xa0\\nit we really weren't expecting to see snow in may\\xa0\\xa0 i know that we're probably going to say this 100\\xa0\\ntimes in this video but it is really interesting\\xa0\\xa0 i'm sure that the water is absolutely freezing as\\xa0\\nwell and from other videos that we have watched\\xa0\\xa0 apparently you can do a walk around the entire\\xa0\\ncircumference of the lake itself in roughly an\\xa0\\xa0 hour or so so i don't know if we're going to do\\xa0\\nthat we're definitely starting to get a little bit\\xa0\\xa0 hungry and we did see that they have an atm and\\xa0\\neverything like that in a restaurant that faces\\xa0\\xa0 down onto the lake so i'm sure that that is the\\xa0\\nperfect next step for us and everything like that so how cold is it uh very very cold\\xa0\\nmy fingers get very red immediately so\\xa0\\xa0 um kind of feels it's colder than if you would\\xa0\\nput your hand directly into snow this is colder\\xa0\\xa0 okay guys so quick pit stop we had a little\\xa0\\nbit too much fun taking pictures and footage\\xa0\\xa0 around the lake and i ended up going and stepping\\xa0\\non like a platform that was literally made of ice\\xa0\\xa0 it broke and my leg went straight into the lake\\xa0\\nand let me tell you something my foot ankle and\\xa0\\xa0 calf is absolutely frozen stiff right now so i'm\\xa0\\ngonna take this shoe off take my wet sock off\\xa0\\xa0 leave my foot in the sunshine for a while\\xa0\\nand then we're gonna go and grab some food so we decided against having food directly at\\xa0\\nthe lake up there because it was quite busy\\xa0\\xa0 and we kind of walking past this other restaurant\\xa0\\nwe already smelled that they have some sausages\\xa0\\xa0 on the grill on the barbecue and i was kind\\xa0\\nof looking forward to having a sausage from\\xa0\\xa0 the barbecue so now we went all the way here\\xa0\\nand we got one Kiełbasa one Karczek and then\\xa0\\xa0 um one portion of Oscypek and\\xa0\\nMirinda and pepsi how much did we pay\\xa0\\xa0 in total for the food we ended\\xa0\\nup just paying 60 Złoty obviously\\xa0\\xa0 it's going to be a little bit more expensive\\xa0\\nbecause of the location where we are but i\\xa0\\xa0 think it is still very good value both of us are\\xa0\\nabsolutely starving as we said earlier in this\\xa0\\xa0 video we did this hike completely and utterly\\xa0\\nfasted with no food just water with us so now\\xa0\\xa0 we're gonna have some nice sugary beverages and\\xa0\\nget this beautiful polish food in our bellies that food was absolutely perfect it was exactly\\xa0\\nwhat we needed and we didn't actually realize how\\xa0\\xa0 hungry we were until we sat down at that table and\\xa0\\nhad that delicious food it's really warmed us up\\xa0\\xa0 and it's definitely going to power us on the way\\xa0\\nback down to the end of this park also speaking\\xa0\\xa0 of not realizing just how hungry we were after\\xa0\\nwe had the Kiełbasa and the Karczek and the\\xa0\\xa0 cheese as well we ended up going and getting a\\xa0\\npiece of Szarlotka as well and that was actually\\xa0\\xa0 our very first try i believe of Szarlotka apple pie\\xa0\\nso like traditional polish apple pie and it was\\xa0\\xa0 very delicious the two hour mark for this hike is\\xa0\\nrealistic i think we made it in exactly two hours\\xa0\\xa0 but it is only realistic if you have a very quick\\xa0\\npace and you do not stop so we i think we stopped\\xa0\\xa0 once just to use the bathroom real quick the one\\xa0\\nof those porta potties or what you call it\\xa0\\xa0 so that was like maybe two minutes or something\\xa0\\nlike that and then we continued walking in a very\\xa0\\xa0 quick pace and if you are a slow walker definitely\\xa0\\ncalculate more than two hours to get up and down\\xa0\\xa0 okay guys so we have completed the full trip now\\xa0\\nwe are just coming back down to the parking lot\\xa0\\xa0 area of tatra national park and Morskie Oko\\xa0\\nhike so what was your impression of Morskie Oko\\xa0\\xa0 my impression is that it is definitely\\xa0\\nworth visiting and worth the hype as well\\xa0\\xa0 i understand why so many people of you\\xa0\\nuh so many of you were uh suggesting it\\xa0\\xa0 to us and Morskie Oko by the way\\xa0\\ntranslates to i believe eye of the sea\\xa0\\xa0 and i can definitely see why the people named\\xa0\\nthat lake up their eye of the sea it's absolutely\\xa0\\xa0 stunning and definitely worth your time and\\xa0\\nsweat to get up there yeah it's definitely a\\xa0\\xa0 natural beauty to behold when you get to the lake\\xa0\\nitself it's surrounded still by ice and it is just\\xa0\\xa0 stunning there is obviously large groups of people\\xa0\\nand tourists that come here on a daily basis so\\xa0\\xa0 do prepare yourself for that but in terms of the\\xa0\\nhike itself it is two hours up and two hours back\\xa0\\xa0 and to be honest it's really not that difficult\\xa0\\ni went in a pair of converse and naomi went\\xa0\\xa0 and a pair of trainers that she got in albania\\xa0\\nfive euro trainers five euro trainers from albania\\xa0\\xa0 so you really don't need any sort of special\\xa0\\nequipment to bring with you on this hike and\\xa0\\xa0 there is always the option of taking horses up\\xa0\\nand back if that's something that you need to do\\xa0\\xa0 just please before you go up make sure that\\xa0\\nyou check the weather forecast because you are\\xa0\\xa0 quite up high in the mountains and weather changes\\xa0\\nvery very fast so if you are planning to go up\\xa0\\xa0 make sure to check the weather beforehand\\xa0\\nand don't just go without being a little bit\\xa0\\xa0 organized yeah it's a very good point um speaking\\xa0\\nof horses we just got passed out by some horse\\xa0\\xa0 horses there but yeah check the weather um it\\xa0\\nchanges very rapidly obviously being in a national\\xa0\\xa0 park and being surrounded by mountains you can\\xa0\\nhave crystal blue clear sky like we have right now\\xa0\\xa0 and in 30 seconds you can be in the thunderstorm\\xa0\\nso definitely come prepared for that and yeah\\xa0\\xa0 we

just the main entrance\\xa0\\xa0 hell yeah gym in a basement I really love it\\xa0\\nwho needs Windows man when you're working out so working out here is 15 zloty\\xa0\\nthat's about three and a half euros so there we go got my gym in big town small\\xa0\\ncities if you search you will find and that's\\xa0\\xa0 what I want to keep on doing so I was a good\\xa0\\narm day I think it's nice to have spent a few\\xa0\\xa0 nights here among these older apartment blocks\\xa0\\nthat I keep seeing everywhere really gives\\xa0\\xa0 you a bit more of that genuine local Polish\\xa0\\nfeel we're leaving in direction of Lithuania\\xa0\\xa0 but first that rear tire it's been\\xa0\\nreally worn out I've got to replace it it's another departure day we're going to leave you got it packed up here almost first\\xa0\\nwe go to the lake and then Białystok ready to roll out she's got the helmets bye intercom still saying that same tune cheers\\xa0\\npretty much still in national park Białowieża yeah there's still a lake a\\xa0\\nbit up north called Siemianówka let's a go\\xa0\\xa0 get your motor running lots of popo\\xa0\\ntoday second or third I see then again\\xa0\\xa0 this is also a customs region right\\xa0\\nclose to the Belarusian border\\xa0\\xa0 by the lake but they have this massive train\\xa0\\nyard that makes sense because on the other\\xa0\\xa0 side of that lake bridge is the border\\xa0\\nwith Belarus so maybe the tracks don't\\xa0\\xa0 match sometimes they do sometimes they don't\\xa0\\nso you got to switch trains and whatnot hold on this is the lake oh but it's pretty much land it's\\xa0\\nmostly land still it did look like that on the map\\xa0\\xa0 yeah it's like a sandbank through the\\xa0\\nlake I wonder if they made that or if\\xa0\\xa0 it was already here sort of this is the railway Freight happens in between Poland and that country\\xa0\\nyou got distracted there by a little something\\xa0\\xa0 got a lot of sixes and nines anything\\xa0\\ninteresting about this uh milestone so these concrete walls continuing here around\\xa0\\nthe bend beyond the railroad got me thinking\\xa0\\xa0 is it a real lake turns out it is a artificial\\xa0\\nlake one of the biggest ones once in Poland and\\xa0\\xa0 it also provides I think still a drinking\\xa0\\nwater for Białystok it's pretty massive we're\\xa0\\xa0 gonna follow it a bit westward there's\\xa0\\nmore of this I'm going to the beach drop it this looks like the beach of course it's a lake why was\\xa0\\nI expecting Baltic blue water I'll give you a push hold on yes I'll give you a\\xa0\\npush turn around like this there you go bon voyage there we go all right let's\\xa0\\nsee what we can find out here speak any English German English\\xa0\\nis ok Pedro nice to meet you\\xa0\\xa0 so it's a 17

yeah nice to meet you man you're the boss\\xa0\\nman yeah e07 plus because I'm not a big fan of\\xa0\\xa0 the standard but the plus I've always wanted\\xa0\\nto try it and there's a lot of contact patch\\xa0\\xa0 and it's going to rain in the Baltics I'm\\xa0\\ntrying to get connection with the road he used to work 10 years how\\xa0\\nlong in the Netherlands Belgium back since 2000 back in Poland yeah 22 years\\xa0\\nago cheers I'm hyped to try out a new one\\xa0\\xa0 it's always fun I had to stop myself from getting\\xa0\\nthat tractionator smaller blocks little contact\\xa0\\xa0 patch in the Baltics it's bound to rain again\\xa0\\nso I'm gonna be smart about it there's guys\\xa0\\xa0 right now watching who just love watching\\xa0\\nme riding all the off-road stuff oh my god\\xa0\\xa0 what happened boys you put passenger foot pegs on\\xa0\\nthe thing and suddenly thank you for the coffee\\xa0\\xa0 Peter no problem we got a place yeah we'll\\xa0\\nsee you tomorrow morning get a nice tire on\\xa0\\xa0 there you even got the Senseo coffee machine\\xa0\\nyou know that's a very Dutch thing to have my wife working for Phillips that's why ah well\\xa0\\ndo you got the discount then yeah Phillips has the\\xa0\\xa0 discount store I have family who works in Phillips\\xa0\\nalso so that's the night in Białystok that we\\xa0\\xa0 knew was an option so let's run our errands\\xa0\\nand you know maybe have a look at the place some place here on the corner it's the Caravan there we go hey you'll love it do you have something i can\\xa0\\ncarry because I have two hands empty oh that's\\xa0\\xa0 that's very nice of you thank you everybody's\\xa0\\nspeaking English here in Białystok very nice Adam's your name huh and you're Pedro nice to meet you too my wife\\xa0\\xa0 Alexandra Good day good day kitchen has everything yeah any questions oh\\xa0\\nyeah just uh the Wi-Fi password it's over here motorcycle parking spot perfect beautiful day lively streets\\xa0\\noh we finished the errands for today\\xa0\\xa0 we got a tire coming should be\\xa0\\narriving tomorrow got a place to\\xa0\\xa0 stay and still some time to check\\xa0\\nout the center here in Białystok one of the\\xa0\\xa0 smaller cities in Poland population-wise\\xa0\\nthat is like top ten but apparently it's\\xa0\\xa0 one of the most densely populated cities\\xa0\\nyeah so for the time being if all goes\\xa0\\xa0 well this city looks like the farewell song\\xa0\\nfor the time being here in Poland because\\xa0\\xa0 going north it's about 150 kilometers\\xa0\\ntops to the border of Lithuania\\xa0\\xa0 and that is where we will be heading next on this\\xa0\\njourney by the Baltic Sea farming in the city now of course the place where we can find Mariska\\xa0\\xa0 is nearby the palace gardens because\\xa0\\nthat's the nearest place with nature so\\xa0\\xa0 that's her natural refuge when she's\\xa0\\nin a city nice so what is this here the Versailles of Poland so park Branicki this here is called the Versailles of Poland\\xa0\\nwhich is understandable I have been to Versailles\\xa0\\xa0 and though not as big it's still something very\\xa0\\nrelaxing about the gardens that's why you came out\\xa0\\xa0 here huh immediately attracted to all the trees\\xa0\\nso building of this commenced midway the 18th\\xa0\\xa0 century so it makes perfectly sense that it has\\xa0\\nall these high peak French society elements from\\xa0\\xa0 that time as the French back then still dominated\\xa0\\nContinental Europe so here you see Atlas carrying\\xa0\\xa0 the weight of the world on his shoulders while\\xa0\\nour Atlas carries the weight of my sorry bum\\xa0\\xa0 around the world Branicki is turning out to be a\\xa0\\nlot more relaxing than what I had expected look\\xa0\\xa0 who's here also our friend Joe bison Zubr and we\\xa0\\nend the day here by another monument commemorating the troublesome past and struggle of Poland\\xa0\\nerected here this monument in name of the\\xa0\\xa0 fallen of the city of Białystok yeah later it was\\xa0\\nchanged to commemorate all the fallen and murdered\\xa0\\xa0 in Poland during the war and even later\\xa0\\nthe inscription was put on the monument God\\xa0\\xa0 honore and homeland and then\\xa0\\nlater still was added independence and of course once more in Poland\\xa0\\nyou are reminded of that past\\xa0\\xa0 that with every passing year seems a\\xa0\\nbit longer ago but it's interesting\\xa0\\xa0 you know because you go through this nice\\xa0\\nlittle town center with this beautiful park you've easily reminded all of a sudden\\xa0\\nof the harder days but maybe that's also\\xa0\\xa0 a page that Poland is turning you know\\xa0\\nbecause these monuments at the end of\\xa0\\xa0 the day are beginning to show their age and\\xa0\\nI think they've been moving on in Poland hello and on that historic note we\\xa0\\nend this nice day here in Białystok\\xa0\\xa0 tomorrow we get the tires sorted so we can ride on see you in the next one folks ciao\",\n",

       " \"hi are you planning to move to poland and renting a flood is still in front of you in this video we'll get through the most common things to know and standards to expect you will get to know how to search for a flood in poland and what to ask your potential landlord here we go chess i'm veronica from welcome home and i'm your guide in the relocation process if the formal issues are still ahead of you check out our previous videos 7 things to know before coming to poland and things to do after moving now let's talk about something nicer how to search for a flat in poland size layout naming let's start with some basic stuff the size and layout of a typical polish apartment in a polish advertisement you will find the information that the number of rooms refers to the actual number this means that the living room and a bedroom the one you know as a one bedroom apartment will be rented out as a two room apartment in some offers you might find the information m2 and three and four something like this what it is m stands for mies kanye an apartment and the number next to it is a number of rooms in the apartment so m2 is a living room and bedroom kitchen and bathroom is not taken into the account so m2 is a one bedroom apartment something smaller a living room with sofa bed kitchen and bathroom the one you know a studio flood it's called cavalerca in polish quite commonly the shared polish apartments don't have a common space a living room but just individual rooms kitchen in shasta apartment is usually separate and quite small and the tenants share one bathroom it's also quite common to find an apartment with two rooms one with bathtub or a shower and second one with just a toilet amenities fully equipped what does it really mean in a standard apartment for rent there will always be a fridge and a cooktop or hope however you call it in a new apartment it will probably be electric and an older one expect gas cooktop also there will probably be an oven and a washing machine a washing machine if not in a bathroom can be found in the kitchen a dishwasher can be expected in new buildings or freshly renovated the older ones may simply lack the space to install it you will probably not find a coffee maker but expect an electric kettle which is not obvious freedoms from southern nations who simply don't drink tea be careful with a dryer it may not be what you think the wild nicole dryer is actually laundry rack a tumble dryer isn't common even in private houses an iron and ironing desk are not a standard but they are relatively easy to buy same for mop and bucket vacuum cleaner and kitchenware pots pans dishes and silverware ask your landlord if it's possible to equip you with that even for an additional cost be careful with the photos the very fact that water or wine glasses are featured in the apartment pictures doesn't mean that they are included so make sure with the landlords what is the full equipment central heating cold winters and temperature below zero degrees are fact in poland but don't be afraid central heating is standard in every apartment the radiator called calorifer in polish is available in every room the most popular ones are central gas or external city regulated the second one is often included in the rent which makes its price fixed and predictable central gas is calculated based on the actual usage of gas and so will be the bill remember that in winter months you will pay more its advantage on the other hand is that when it gets colder the building can turn on the heating earlier in case of the city regulated system the season is regulated and lasts from october to april if the apartment is equipped with a dual function air conditioner heater you can warm yourself up but these are standard in commercial and services premises but not in the resolution ones obviously you should make sure that heating in your rental apartment is functional and efficient because it will affect your utility bills utilities utilities are very important aspect of the apartment rental this monthly cost can significantly influence the rental price so make sure what you actually pay for water electricity waste disposal and internet are the most common components of the utilities additionally it can include gas for example in a previously mentioned central gas heating a water heater or a cooktop when choosing an apartment make sure who is responsible for signing the contract with the utility suppliers in poland when it goes for the long term it usually applies to the tenant but it will be easier if your landlord will take this duty and you will pay only for the usage when it comes to the internet fast connection isn't a problem in poland and there are several suppliers to choose from here as much as with other utilities it will be asked if the londoner will sign the contract when he has many apartments he can negotiate better prices than you on your own waste management fun fact one of the typical feature of a polish apartment is a garbage can hidden in the cabinet under the sink but let's leave the jokes apart and talk more about the waste the waste collection costs are included in the utility charge since 2020 recycling has been mandatory and enforced by cities and local governments yes it hasn't been long but better later than never those who recycle pay less for example in katowice the recyclable collection fee costs 26 lots per person an unsorted waste collection costs about 50 shorty twice as much be careful if a single person in the entire building fails to comply the recycled rules the whole building may pay the city may impose a fee so it's worth thinking not only about yourself but about whole community pricing as i live and work in katowice i can best tell you about our sign legion real estate market in the larger cities like krakow wrote rough or warsaw the prices will be much higher but also you'll have a bigger choice the average prices are as follows a room in a shared apartment small but cozy and renovated apartment around 800 slotted something bigger around thousand the lower standard room was about 600 zloty the price include the utilities studio in a low standard it's about 1100 zloty higher standard costs about 1500 slotted you have to add the utilities finding a nice and renovated studio flat for under thousands lotte will be very difficult one bedroom apartment the price starts at 1400 zloty but the average is 1600. plus utilities usually if the apartment is priced for 1500 zloty you have to add not only the utilities but also the administrative fee we will tell more about that in our next video the prices of a higher standard and biggest apartments may go up to two thousand eight hundred slaughter plus utilities a two bedroom apartment would cost about two thousand five hundred zloty plus the utilities and often plus the administrative fee so the total amount may be about three thousand zloty if you leave the city center and don't care about standard that much you may find a place for around 2500 slot a large two bedroom apartment freshly renovated and in the city center may cost about 5 000 water including all costs there is also one more option especially for students a dormitory old-style dormitories in poland don't have a good reputation they are the most economic option but they offer a push standard fortunately the market situation is changing constantly for example in katowice we have a brand new dormitory if you rent an apartment there for only the academic year the price starts for around 1 300 slotted for a 15 square meter studio flat and around 2000 slotted for a 25 square meter studio with a balcony as you can see the rates are similar to those on the market but if you are a community person you will have an access to a large common space with a kitchen study room gym cinema room and many more there is also the dormitory operated by the silesian university the prices are much lower but also the standard and the location are worse a double room costs about 400 zloty a single for 500 and there are also studio apartments for around 600 zloty per month where to search where to search there are two basic options search on your own on the internet or ask an agency the internet is the most convenient way to search for a flat so i will focus on that you have plenty of options within different budgets there are two most popular polish rental platforms oilx and autodom autodom is a national platform where you can find homes and apartments for both buy and rent usually offers are placed and promoted by rental agencies so you may expect a fee if you decide to rent a flat there read every ad carefully and if not mentioned there ask the promoter direct directly to be clear about the costs on the other hand oylex is dedicated mostly for regular people who have their apartment and want to rent them out you may browse many different standard ads before you find something interesting but this will give you an idea of the standard and pricing oil leaks and autodom are the most popular ones but not the only you can also search on gumtree or facebook marketplace if you are an erasmus student check out erasmus.com the problem you may face is that most of the ads are in polish so you will have to use the translator if you have any doubts ask the landlord the honest one should answer all your questions summary okay guys i think that's a lot to consider when searching for an apartment at the end of the day it will be your long-term place and you want to film at home right on our website we share some more recommendations on what to consider when searching for a flat also we included some fun facts about polish standards all the links are below we hope now that with our tips you will easily find your perfect place and when you find it check out our next video about the formal aspects of rental terms

       " \"(upbeat music) - Do you wanna try some Polish food and not sure what you'll like? My family is originally from Poland. So I've been exposed to Polish food for quite some time now. In this video I'm gonna cover some food that I ate on my recent trip to Poland and what it's called. So if you wanna try some Polish food you can know what to look out for. Don't forget to like,\\nsubscribe, and share this video with your friends. My favorite Polish soups are\\n(speaks in foreign language) which is like a dill pickle soup. I really like (speaks in foreign language) which is a tomato soup. (speaks in foreign language)\\nwhich is a mushroom soup. (speaks in foreign language)\\nwhich is like a chicken noodle. I also like (speaks in foreign language) which is like a beet soup with dumplings. And the dumplings are filled\\nwith sauerkraut and mushrooms. So those are my favorites\\nbut there is no shortages of soup flavors to try in Poland. Pierogi or Pierogi come in\\nmany, many, many flavors. I've listed a few here\\njust so you can get an idea of what flavors appeal to you. Feel free to screenshot\\nthis page as a reference. My favorite are the cheese\\nand potato filled ones as well as the ones with\\nsauerkraut and mushroom. Also there are dessert pierogis as well. You're probably wondering\\nwhat I'm talking about or what I mean by that. But essentially you can order pierogis with strawberries inside, blueberries, cherries, raspberries, and then you just add a bit\\nof butter or sugar on top, sometimes sour cream is an option. I was so obsessed with blueberry pierogis on my latest trip to Poland that my aunt even made\\nthem from scratch for me. I know, I'm lucky. Meat was always present on\\nmy kitchen table growing up. So it came as no surprise\\nthat throughout Poland there are some amazing meat meals. I tend to stick with kielbasa. It's a safe bet for me, it's a sausage. Usually it's served with bread and one place even gave\\nit to me with pickles. Then we had (speaks in foreign language) which are breaded pork cutlets. We probably ate this every other day. It was so delicious we\\njust couldn't get enough. There were also a lot of\\n(speaks in foreign language). Some of them come with meat, others come with other stuffing options such as sauerkraut and mushrooms. And of course there are a\\nton of other meat dishes that I've missed such as\\n(speaks in foreign language), but this video is just to get you started on what I actually ate over\\nmy two week tour of Poland. If you're interested in\\nnon-meat slash veggie dishes you can try (speaks in foreign language) which are Polish apple pancakes. Or potato pancakes, (speaks\\nin foreign language). If you like cheese, we tried\\n(speaks in foreign language) for the first time which is smoked cheese made of salted sheep milk. Yes some of them come with bacon wrapped but you can pick and choose what you like. Many Polish people also\\npick their own mushrooms to include in their meals. So make sure to pick and\\nfind ones like these. And leave ones like\\nthose alone (chuckles). Okay now let's briefly touch on desserts. When I was younger and visiting Poland, (speaks in foreign language)\\nis what stood out to me. After being away for 15 years I wanted to see if they were\\nstill popular in Poland. (speaks in foreign\\nlanguage) is essentially waffle with cream,\\nfruits, candy, chocolate. There's an infinite amount\\nof topping possibilities. Another thing to look out for is (speaks in foreign language)\\nwhich is a hard waffle rolled up into a tube of sorts (chuckles) and there's whipped cream inside. It's so yummy. Of course I need to cover\\n(speaks in foreign language) which is a famous Polish donut. You can have them glazed\\nor with powdered sugar. But now there's a variety\\nof more toppings these days and inside you're gonna\\nhave a jam filled center. So I grew up with these candies. My mom always called them\\n(speaks in foreign language) 'cause that's the plural. But here they're called\\n(speaks in foreign language). So I'm gonna show you what\\nthis'll actually looks like. And in the center it\\nshould have a gooey thing but each one's a little bit\\ndifferent so let's try that. Um hum, so good. And now we're gonna try a\\nSaint Martin's croissant which is protected by the European Union Certificate of Authenticity which means it can only\\nbe reproduced here. I think it's raining (laughs). When you're in Poland, why don't you give the Bar Mleczny a shot which literally means milk bar. They're usually on the cheaper side and have traditional style Polish food. If you can't read it in Polish, they usually have a\\nbunch of food on display, so that's helpful. Most places that we've seen in Poland do have an English translation\\nunderneath the menu. This one doesn't in particular. So if there's a Polish dish\\nyou really love and wanna try maybe google it in advance\\nso you can actually know what you're looking out for. But you cant' go wrong with\\nthese little breakfast spots, lunch spots, dinner spots. Come here and you're in good hands. Also I created another\\nvideo which is called Poland Travel Video, What to do in Poland, which will help you navigate the beautiful country of Poland. Did you enjoy that video? Well let me know in the comments below. Let's become friends, let's connect. And I'll see you on the next one.\",\n",

still ahead of you feel free to check my previous video let's go back to the main topic let's check what you have to do pencil number passel is polish national identification number all posts have one and so shows foreigners but why do you need one since 2018 all people living in poland both polls and foreigners have to register their address when registering they will receive peso automatically but you will need pasel not only for residence purposes you will also need that for the tax report without it your employer cannot register you in the polish tax office how to get one as i already said you receive it automatically along with the residence registration the other way is to fill out the application form in polish but you will find our tips in the description below and deliver it to the city hall of the city you live in also don't forget to take your passport or id card with you how long will you have to wait your application will be accepted immediately and you will receive the peso right away residence registration in poland there is an obligation for both posts and foreigners to have their address registers if they are staying in poland for over 30 days for non-new citizens or a free month for eu citizens we call it the zameldovania if you already know that you are going to stay in poland for over these one or three months go and register your address if you are from eu efta switzerland or you are you are a family member of such a foreigner you have 30 days to register your address counting from the date of arrival to this place if you are from non-eu country we have only four days to register in order to fulfill that application visit district office opportu uh for the place you live in requirements are different from eu and non-eu citizens [Music] you will also need the application form filled out in polish if you are an eu citizen you first need to be registered in the voya vote ships office only after that you can complete some elderfunnier i'll talk about this later in this video when leaving poland or changing your address you have to notify the office this will result in the removal from the resident's address a few more things to remember a residence address is valid only as long as your rental agreement is the application is free of charge make sure with your landlord that the apartment that you are renting is a residential unit local you can only register to a flat with your residential unit status in the past failure to comply this amount of money could lead to some financial penalties but right now it's no longer valid however it might be an obstacle for some other procedures for example getting a temporary residence permit health insurance as i said in the previous video in poland there are two types of health insurance public and private health insurance is very important thinking poland non-new citizens have to get travel health insurance when applying for a visa but it usually covers only emergencies the public health insurance in poland is operated by the national health fund narudova fund and msat the health care system in poland is based on the principle of equal treatment and access for everybody when can you access public health care in poland if you are a citizen of a country of the eu after or switzerland if you have a visa with permission to work if you have a temporary residence permit if you have a permanent residence permit if you have a long-term residence permit of the eu if you have a humanitarian residence permit if you have a tolerated residence permit or if you have a refugee status in poland as i mentioned in the previous video employers on employment for a fee for a task contract get public health insurance automatically an insured employee has an obligation to report his or her family members to be covered by the nf if they are not insured yet if you are a change to get job you have to report your family members to new employer adding your family members doesn't result in higher or additional contribution all students have to be insured even if they are staying in poland only for a short term students have to apply for the insurance on their own in order to get voluntary public health insurance you need to have your address registered to get it you have to fill out some documents of course in polish and bring it to the end of that branch in your city the link to all documents is in the description what about the cost because depends on the average seller in poland in july 2021 it was about 500 slotted students and doctoral students pay less about 55 slaughter a month the most important thing about this insurance is that any of that will check your previous insurance period if you have never been in poland or if you or you didn't pay insurance for the last three months you will have to pay for the gap period the national health fund gives you access to general practitioner or family doctor however you call it in polish this le casa regina first you have to choose one go to the energetic clinics closer to your home get the documents ask the nurse for the doctor you should choose and fill out the documents according to the nurse guidance night and medical care on holidays emergency room and hospital care rehabilitation diagnostic test first you must get the revelry visit to specialists first you need to go to the general practitioner get the refl sign up on the waiting list and wait for your appointment without the referral you can go to psychiatrists oncologists dentists or gynecologists all citizens of european union and european economic trade area are entitled to get public health insurance offered by the nfd for free they only need to be insured in their country and before coming to poland they have to get the european health insurance card private insurance providers obviously you can get an insurance from the private company but you have to remember that they don't offer the same equal services as you can expect from the public one everything depends on the policy the package the cheapest one usually offers only the general practitioner and some specialists of course the more you pay the more you get but the most expensive ones can get even up to 3 000 a year one more thing to remember is that the private policies usually offer some delay periods this means that you cannot go to a certain doctor or have a surgery unless you pay the contribution for 60 or even 120 days also you have to remember that the private insurance does not cover the emergencies so in case you go to a hospital you will have to pay for treatment test and everything on your own some packages offer this sickness benefit but this is not the standard some employers especially large international companies offers the private health insurance as an extra benefit residence permit and card if you want to stay here longer than your legal stay or visa is apply for a residence permit the temporary residence permit is valid between 3 months and 3 years to apply for it you have to fill out some documents it must be done in polish then you have to bring it to the voyable ship's office along with photos and copy of your passport you have to do it at least on the last day of your legal stay in poland if you also want to start or continue working in poland you also have to apply for the temporary residence permit without permission to work to do it you have to add the attachment number one filled out by your employer a list of recommended additional documents is quite long thus i recommend you to check the website the link is in the description when submitting the application you will receive a stamp in your passport you can legally stay in poland even if your visa expires however if you would like to go back to your country then when coming back to poland you have the visa again the minimum waiting time is a month but as always everything depends on the number of people applying so better don't wait till the last moment if everything goes well you'll receive a temporary residence permit with a cart you can travel across europe or at least this ranking zone as for costs this damn duty costs 440 slotted and there is also a fee for issuing the card 50 zloty what happens if your application goes rejected you have 14 days to make a complaint to the head of office for foreigners and then they have seven days to answer you if this doesn't help you have 30 days to leave poland if you stay in poland after your legal stay or visa expires and you don't apply for temporary residence permit you will be forced to leave the country important information for eu citizens if you are an eo citizen and you want to stay in poland for more than three months you have to be registered in the avoidable ship's office some people haven't done that even after years of being in poland well you won't be expelled from the country but you might be fined okay it's time to sum up here are some tips for you when you are still in your country made a copy of as many documents as possible we also recommend translating them to polish for example birth certificate driving license bachelor master doctor diploma work certificates a certificate that proves that you are paying the health insurance contribution in your country mary's certificate if you are married remember that in poland same-sex marriages aren't legal no claim bonus if you want to have a card medical and dental records especially if you need special treatment financial records although many paul speaks english all the documents must be filled out in polish so find a friend who will help you with that and will go to the offices with you last but not least don't leave everything to the last minute the bureaucracy may take much longer than you think and you don't want to get in trouble and stressed don't you here you will find the continuation of the checklist after coming to poland four days after register your address if you are not from the eu register in the avoidable ship's office if you are from eu one week after register your address if you are from eu register your family members to the end of that via your insurance if they are not insured two weeks after get private or public health insurance if you don't have one already get a polish zloty bank account two months after apply for a temporary residence permit if you have a three month visa 10 months after apply for a residence permit if you have a 12 month visa the checklist is also available in the description so you can easily download it that's all for now i hope that your

       " \"O ALLIES UKRAINE AND RUSSIA. LET'S LISTEN. GREAT ALLIES. PRESIDENT DUDA. PRIME MINISTER, MR PRIME MINISTER, MR MAYOR. ALL THE FORMER MINISTERS AND PRESIDENTS. AS WELL AS MAYORS AND POLISH POLITICAL LEADERS FROM ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THANK YOU FOR WELCOMING BACK. TO POLAND. YOU KNOW, IT'S NEARLY ONE YEAR AGO. NEARLY ONE YEAR AGO, I SPOKE AT THE ROYAL CASTLE HERE IN WARSAW. JUST WEEKS AFTER VLADIMIR PUTIN HAD UNLEASHED HIS MURDEROUS ASSAULT ON UKRAINE. THE LARGEST LAND WAR. IN EUROPE SINCE WORLD WAR TWO HAD BEGUN. AND THE PRINCIPLES. THAT HAS BEEN THE CORNERSTONE OF PEACE, PROSPERITY, STABILITY ON THIS PLANET FOR MORE THAN 75 YEARS. AT RISK OF BEING SHATTERED. ONE YEAR AGO. THE WORLD WAS BRACING FOR THE FALL OF KEEP WELL, I JUST COME FROM A VISITOR. KEITH AND I CAN REPORT KEEP STANDS STRONG. KEEP STANDS PROUD. IT STANDS TALL. AND MOST IMPORTANT TO STANDS FREE. WITH RUSSIA INVADED. IT WASN'T JUST UKRAINE BEING TESTED. THE WHOLE WORLD FACE TO TEST FOR THE AGES. EUROPE WAS BEING TESTED. AMERICA WAS BEING TESTED. NATO IS BEING TESTED. ALL DEMOCRACIES ARE BEING TESTED. THE QUESTIONS WE FACE WERE SIMPLE AS THEY WERE PROFOUND. WOULD YOU RESPOND? OR WOULD WE THE OTHER WAY? WOULD IT BE STRONG? WHERE DID THE WEEK WOULD BE YOU WE WOULD BE, WOULD WE THE ALL OF OUR ALLIES WOULD BE UNITED. OR DIVIDED ONE YEAR LATER. WE KNOW THE ANSWER. WE DID RESPOND, WE WOULD BE STRONG. WE WOULD BE UNITED AND THE WORLD WOULD NOT LOOK THE OTHER WAY. WE'RE ALSO FACED FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS. BUT THE COMMITMENT THE MOST BASIC PRINCIPLES. WHAT WE STAND. UP FOR THE SOVEREIGNTY OF NATIONS WOULD BE STAND UP. THE RIGHT OF PEOPLE TO LIVE FREE FROM NAKED AGGRESSION. WE STAND UP FOR DEMOCRACY. ONE YEAR LATER. WE KNOW THE ANSWERS. YES WE WOULD STAND UP FOR SOVEREIGNTY AND WE DID. YES WE WOULD STAND UP FOR THE RIGHT OF PEOPLE TO LIVE FREE FROM AGGRESSION, AND WE DID. AND WE WOULD STAND UP FOR DEMOCRACY, AND WE DID. AND YESTERDAY I HAD THE HONOR TO STAND WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKY AND CAVE TO DECLARE THAT WE WILL KEEP STANDING UP FOR THESE SAME THINGS, NO MATTER WHAT. WHEN PRESIDENT PUTIN ORDERED HIS TANKS TO ROLL IN UKRAINE. HE THOUGHT. WE WOULD ROLL OVER. HE WAS WRONG. RANKED UKRAINIAN PEOPLE ARE TOO BRAVE. AMERICA EUROPE, A COALITION OF NATIONS FOR THE ATLANTIC TO THE PACIFIC. WE WERE TO UNIFIED DEMOCRACY WAS TOO STRONG. INSTEAD OF AN EASY VICTORY HE PERCEIVED AND PREDICTED. PUTIN LEFT. BURNOUT TANKS AND RUSSIA'S FORCES IN DELAY AND JUST IN DISARRAY. HE THOUGHT HE'D GET THE FENDER REALIZATION OF NATO. INSTEAD HE GOT THE DATA IZATION OF FINLAND. AND SWEDEN. HE THOUGHT NATURE WOULD FRACTURE AND DIVIDE. INSTEAD. NATO IS MORE UNITED AND MORE UNIFIED THAN EVER THAN EVER BEFORE. HE THOUGHT HE COULD WEAPONIZE ENERGY. TO CRACK YOUR RESOLVE EUROPE'S RESOLVE. INSTEAD WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER TO END EUROPE'S DEPENDENCE ON RUSSELL. RUSSIAN FOSSIL FUELS. HE THOUGHT AUTOCRATS LIKE HIMSELF WERE TOUGH. AND LEADERS OF DEMOCRACY WERE SOFT. AND THEN HE MET THE IRON WILL OF AMERICA AND THE NATION'S EVERYWHERE. THEY REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE WORLD GOVERNED BY FEAR AND FORCE. HE FOUND HIMSELF AT WAR WITH THE NATION LED BY A MAN WHOSE COURAGE WOULD BE FORGED IN FIRE AND STEEL PRESIDENT ZELINSKY PRESIDENT PUTIN. PRESIDENT PUTIN IS CONFRONTED WITH SOMETHING TODAY THAT YOU DIDN'T THINK WAS POSSIBLE A YEAR AGO. THE DEMOCRACY OF THE WORLD HAVE GROWN STRONGER. NOT WEAKER. BUT THE AUTOCRATS OF THE WORLD HAVE GONE WEAKER, NOT STRONGER. BECAUSE OF THE MOMENTS OF GREAT UPHEAVAL AND UNCERTAINTY. THAT KNOWING WHAT YOU STAND FOR IS MOST IMPORTANT. AND KNOWING WHO STANDS WITH YOU. MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE. PEOPLE OF POLAND KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THAT. IN FACT , YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW IT BETTER THAN ANYONE HERE IN POLAND. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT SOLIDARITY MEANS. PARTITION AND OPPRESSION. WHEN THE BEAUTIFUL CITY WAS DESTROYED AFTER THE WARSAW UPRISING. DURING DECADES UNDER THE IRON FIST OF COMMUNIST RULE. POLAND ENDURED BECAUSE YOU STOOD TOGETHER. THAT'S HOW BRAVE LEADERS OF THE OPPOSITION AND THE PEOPLE OF BELARUS CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR THEIR DEMOCRACY. THAT'S HOW THE RESOLVE OF MOLDOVAN PEOPLE. RESOLVE THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO LIVE IN FREEDOM. GAINED THEM INDEPENDENCE AND PUT THEM ON THE PATH TO EU MEMBERSHIP. PRESIDENT SANDHU ENSURE TODAY I'M NOT SURE SHE IS, BUT I'M PROUD TO STAND WITH YOU AND THE FREEDOM LOVING PEOPLE IN MOLDOVA. GIVE HER A HAND ROUND OF APPLAUSE. ONE YEAR AND ONE YEAR INTO THIS WAR. PUTIN NO LONGER DOUBTS THE STRENGTH OF OUR COALITION. BUT HE'S STILL DOUBTS OUR CONVICTION. HE DOUBTS ARE STAYING POWER. IT DOUBTS OUR CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE. HE DOUBTS WITH HER NATO CAN REMAIN UNIFIED. BUT THERE SHOULD BE NO DOUBT OUR SUPPORT YOU FOR UKRAINE WILL NOT WAVER. NATO WILL NOT BE DIVIDED AND WE WILL NOT TIRED. PRESIDENT PUTIN'S CRAVEN LUST FOR LAND AND POWER WILL FAIL. AND THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE'S LOVE FOR THEIR COUNTRY WILL PREVAIL. DEMOCRACY IN THE WORLD WILL STAND GUARD OVER FREEDOM TODAY, TOMORROW AND FOREVER. SO THAT'S WHAT IT THAT'S WHAT THAT STAKE HERE. FREEDOM. THAT'S THE MESSAGE. I CARRIED A KEEP YESTERDAY. DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE OF UKRAINE. WHEN PRESIDENT ZELENSKY SAID HE CAME TO THE UNITED STATES IN DECEMBER QUOTE, HE SAID, THIS STRUGGLE WILL DEFINE THE WORLD. AND WHAT OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN HOW THEY LIVE. AND THEN THEIR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. HE WASN'T ALWAYS SPEAKING ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN OF UKRAINE. HE WAS SPEAKING ABOUT ALL OF OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN, YOURS AND MINE. OR SAYING AGAIN TODAY WITH THE PEOPLE OF POLAND. AND THE PEOPLE ACROSS EUROPE SAW FOR DECADES. APPETITES OF THE AUTOCRAT. CANNOT BE APPEASED. THEY MUST BE OPPOSED. AUTOCRATS ONLY UNDERSTAND ONE WORD. NO. NO, NO. NO, YOU WILL NOT TAKE MY COUNTRY. NO YOU WILL NOT TAKE MY FREEDOM. NO, YOU WILL NOT TAKE MY FUTURE. AND I'LL REPEAT TONIGHT. WHAT I SAID LAST YEAR, THE SAME PLACE A DICTATOR. BETTER NOT REBUILDING AN EMPIRE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO E IS THE PEOPLE'S LOVE OF LIBERTY. BRUTALITY. WE'LL NEVER GRIND DOWN THE WILL OF THE FREE AND UKRAINE. UKRAINE WILL NEVER BE A VICTORY FOR RUSSIA. NEVER. FOR FREE. PEOPLE REFUSE TO LIVE IN A WORLD OF HOPELESSNESS IN DARKNESS. YOU KNOW, THIS HAS BEEN AN EXTRAORDINARY YEAR IN EVERY SENSE. EXTRAORDINARY BEAUTY PALETTE E. RUSSIAN FORCES AND MERCENARIES. THEY'VE COMMITTED TO PRIVATE EASE. CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY. WITHOUT SHAME OR COMPUNCTION. TARGETED CIVILIANS WITH DEATH AND DESTRUCTION. USED RAPE AS A WEAPON OF WAR. STOLEN UKRAINIAN CHILDREN. ATTEMPT TO STAY IN AN ATTEMPT TO STEAL UKRAINE'S FUTURE. BOMB TRAIN STATIONS, MATERNITY HOSPITAL SCHOOLS AND ORPHANAGES. NO. ONE NO ONE CAN TURN AWAY. THEIR EYES SHOULD BE ATROCITIES RUSSIA'S COMMITTING AGAINST THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE. IT'S A PORN, IT'S ABHORRENT. BUT EXTRAORDINARILY AS WELL. HAS BEEN THE RESPONSE OF THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE. AND THE WORLD. ONE YEAR AFTER THE BOMBS BEGAN TO FALL. RUSSIAN TANKS ROLLED INTO UKRAINE. UKRAINE IS STILL INDEPENDENT AND FREE. FROM KHERSON KHARKIV. UKRAINIAN FIGHTERS HAVE RECLAIMED THEIR LAND. OR THE 50% OF THE TERRITORY RUSSIA HELD LAST YEAR. THE BLUE AND THE YELLOW FLAG OF UKRAINE PROUDLY WAVES ONCE AGAIN. PRESIDENT ZELENSKY STILL LEADS THE DEMOCRATIC ELECTED GOVERNMENT. THAT REPRESENTS THE WILL OF THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE. THE WORLD HAS ALREADY VOTED MULTIPLE TIMES. INCLUDING THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO CONDEMN RUSSIANS AGGRESSION. AND SUPPORTED JUST PEACE. EACH TIME IN THE U. N. THAT VOTE HAS BEEN OVERWHELMING. IN OCTOBER. 143 NATIONS. THE UNITED NATIONS CONDEMNED RUSSIA'S ILLEGAL ANNEXATION. ONLY FOUR FOR THE ENTIRE U. N VOTED WITH RUSSIA FOUR SO TONIGHT. I SPEAK ONCE MORE TO THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA. UNITED STATES AND THE NATIONS OF EUROPE. DO NOT SEEK TO CONTROL OR DESTROY RUSSIA. THE WEST WAS NOT PLOTTING TO ATTACK RUSSIA, AS PUTIN SAID TODAY. AND MILLIONS OF RUSSIAN CITIZENS. I ONLY WANT TO LIVE IN PEACE WITH THEIR NEIGHBORS ARE NOT THE ENEMY. THIS WAR IS NEVER NECESSITY. IT'S A TRAGEDY. PRESIDENT PUTIN CHOSE THIS WAR. EVERY DAY. THE WORK CONTINUES IS HIS CHOICE. HE COULD END THE WAR WITH THE WORD. IT'S SIMPLE. RUSSIA STOPPED INVADING UKRAINE. IT WOULD END THE WAR. IF UKRAINE STOP DEFENDING ITSELF AGAINST RUSSIA WOULD BE THE END OF UKRAINE. THAT'S WHY TOGETHER. WE'RE MAKING SURE UKRAINE CAN DEFEND ITSELF. UNITED STATES. HAS ASSEMBLED AWARD WORLDWIDE COALITION. MORE THAN 50 NATIONS. TO GET CRITICAL WEAPONS AND SUPPLIES. TO THE BRAVE UKRAINIAN FIGHTERS ON THE FRONT LINES. AIR DEFENSE SYSTEMS, ARTILLERY, AMMUNITION, TANKS, ARMORED VEHICLES.

THERE IS MUCH FOR US TO BE PROUD OF OVER THE ALL THAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED TOGETHER THIS PAST YEAR. BUT WE HAVE TO BE HONEST AND CLEAR EYED. AS WE LOOK AT THE YEAR AHEAD. THE DEFENSE OF FREEDOM IS NOT THE WORK OF A DAY OR EVERY YEAR. IT'S ALWAYS DIFFICULT. IT'S ALWAYS IMPORTANT. AS UKRAINE CONTINUE TO DEFEND ITSELF. AGAINST THE RUSSIAN ONSLAUGHT AND LAUNCH COUNTER OFFENSIVE OF ITS OWN. THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE HARD AND VERY BETTER DAYS. VICTORIES AND TRAGEDIES. BUT UKRAINE IS STILL FOR THE FIGHT AHEAD.

THE UNITED STATES HAS COME TOGETHER WITH OUR ALLIES AND PARTNERS. EXTRAORDINARY COALITION. TO STAND AGAINST RUSSIAN AGGRESSION. BUT THE WORK IN FRONT OF US IT'S NOT JUST WHAT WE'RE AGAINST.

IT IS GOOD TO SEE YOU. THE PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY IS STICKING TO HIS CLAIM THAT THIS WAS  NOT A UKRAINIAN MISSILE. WHAT IS THE INVESTIGATION INTO THIS EXPLOSION? IS UKRAINE LIKELY TO GET ACCESS TO THE SITE THAT THEY ARE ASKING FOR? >> Reporter: IT IS AWKWARD FOR WESTERN LEADERS, THE WHITE HOUSE AND FOR UKRAINE. THIS IS A  DIVISION THAT IS\\nMADE PUBLIC. MADE PUBLIC. THAT IS NOT REALLY WHAT THEY WANT. WHAT THEY TRY TO DO IS MAINTAIN A UNITED FRONT AND RESPECT RUSSIA. HOWEVER, VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY IS SAYING THAT  HIS OFFICIALS HAVE TOLD HIM THAT THIS WAS LIKELY A\\nRUSSIAN MISSILE. RUSSIAN MISSILE. HE SAID IT WOULD NOT MAKE SENSE FOR ME TO NOT TRUST THEM, AND HE SAID, GOD VOTED SOME MISSILES THAT KILLED THESE PEOPLE AND WE HAVE TO APOLOGIZE, BUT FIRST, THERE NEEDS TO BE AN INVESTIGATION. WHAT THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE\\nIS SAYING IS THAT THEY WANT IS SAYING IS THAT THEY WANT ACCESS TO POLAND. THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE UNITED, SO IT IS VERY DIFFICULT. ULTIMATELY THERE IS FRUSTRATION AMONG EUROPEAN LEADERS THAT UKRAINE IS TAKING THIS STANCE BECAUSE THEY SEEM FAIRLY\\nCONVINCED THAT THIS WAS A CONVINCED THAT THIS WAS A MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM, POSSIBLY AN F-300 SOVIET-MADE MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM USED BY THE UKRAINIANS, MAYBE THAT IS PART OF THE REASON FOR THE CONFUSION, AGAIN, IF IT WAS SOVIET-MADE, BUT FIRED BY THE UKRAINIANS YOU COULD SEE WHY PEOPLE MAY MAKE A MISJUDGMENT AT THIS STAGE. >> IT IS COMPLICATED. I WANT TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS HAPPENING INSIDE OF UKRAINE, THERE ARE REPORTS OF STRIKES IN ODESSA AMONG OTHER PLACES. WHAT IS GOING ON? >> Reporter: IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT IT IS A CONTINUING WAVE OF AIRSTRIKES BY THE RUSSIANS. THAT IS WHY PRESIDENT  BIDEN IS TRYING TO PUT THE FOCUS ON IT SAYING THAT WHAT HAPPENED IN POLAND IS NOT UKRAINE'S FAULT EVEN IF THERE WAS A UKRAINIAN DEFENSE SYSTEM. THE LATEST NEWS THAT FOUR OF BEEN KILLED IN A DOZEN WOUNDED FROM DRONE MISSILE STRIKES AROUND UKRAINE. UKRAINIAN OFFICIALS SAY THAT THEY HAD SHUT DOWN TWO CRUISE MISSILES AND FIVE IRANIAN DRONES. THAT IS AN IMPROVING RATE OF SUCCESS FOR THE UKRAINIANS, AND PERHAPS THAT IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOW BEEN HELPED A LITTLE BIT TO BUY WESTERN DEFENSES. THE PICTURE IS OF AN ONGOING RUSSIAN OFFENSIVE OVER UKRAINE. PERHAPS WHAT HAPPENED IN POLAND IS SOMEWHAT INEVITABLE WHEN\\nTHERE IS A WERE TAKING PLACE THERE IS A WERE TAKING PLACE RIGHT NEXT DOOR. >> YOU BROKE DOWN WHAT WE SEE ON THE GROUND, ON THE DIPLOMATIC FRONT IT LOOKS LIKE THE BLACK SEA DEALS BETWEEN UKRAINE AND RUSSIA HAS BEEN EXTENDED AGAIN, THAT IS BECAUSE WE KNOW THE WAR HAS IMPACTED THE FOOD SUPPLY AND GRAIN SUPPLY. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT? >> IT WAS EXTENDED FOR ANOTHER 120 DAYS. THIS IS A GRAIN DEAL, A FERTILIZER DEAL AND FOODSTUFFS DEAL. IT IS DAYS AWAY FROM EXPIRING. IT MEANS ESSENTIAL FOODSTUFFS COULD BE EXPORTED THROUGH THE BLACK SEA, WHICH OF COURSE IS PART OF THE WAR ZONE BETWEEN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE. IT COULD BE EXPORTED THROUGH THEIR TWO PLACES LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, WHERE I WAS A FEW WEEKS AGO, WHERE THERE IS AN EXPANDING FOOD CRISIS. THE IMPLICATIONS OF HAVING THE BLOCKADE IN THE BLACK SEA WOULD HAVE BEEN CRIPPLING, AND, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE RUSSIANS HAVE FIRED ON SHIPS, THE INSURERS WHO ENSURE THAT THE SHIPS ARE ABLE TO SETTLE WOULD LIKELY HAVE SAID WE ARE NOT GOING TO ENSURE THEM, THERE IS A RISK OF CONTINUED CONFLICT IN THAT ZONE. SO, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT. IT IMPORTANT BREAKTHROUGH WEST\",\n",

       " \"How to renew your driving license in Wroclaw?  Hi guys my name is Darek Krasnicki and I'm  the leading certified physician for extending the validity period of medically restricted driving license in Poland. I'm so called the drivers doctor and the leading expert on this matter and more than three-quarters of foreign drivers who stay in Poland and re-apply following the expiry of their national licenses are issued with another license valid  not longer than four years. If you are going to stay in Wroclaw a bit longer it is wise to allow your driving license to be valid for a longer period of time and it should reduce the burden on you as an individual license holder. If this situation applies to you just visit my surgery in 215 Zernicka street in Wroclaw I don't usually see any problems if the maximum validated period for restricted driving license was extended even up to 15 years but before visiting my office you have to register online or by e-mail like Lekarz@Krasnicki.com.pl I repeat  Lekarz@Krasnicki.com.pl Lekarz@Krasnicki.com.pl or just call is (+48) 601 577 123 I repeat 601 577 123 and after visiting my surgery you can is submit my medical certificate to the Polish Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency and smoothly renew your driving license and then enjoy visiting Poland by your own car.

       " 'JUDY WOODRUFF: But first: European Union leaders\\nhave watched with alarm as Poland has reduced the independence of judges and the press. The E.U. has threatened to crack down on member\\nstates that fail to uphold modern democratic values. However, as special correspondent Malcolm\\nBrabant reports from Warsaw, Poland\\'s special relationship with the Trump administration\\nmay encourage Poland\\'s resistance to its European neighbors. MALCOLM BRABANT: \"Free courts now\" is the\\nclarion cry. Outside a courthouse in Central Warsaw, demonstrators\\ndemand the removal of a judge appointed by the populist conservative government to replace\\none of a more independent spirit. They accuse the country\\'s justice minister\\nof being a judicial puppet master. MICHAL WAWRYKIEWICZ, Free Courts Initiative:\\nWe are still in a battle for the rule of law in Poland, the rule of law that is dismantled\\nduring the last four years permanently. MALCOLM BRABANT: Michal Wawrykiewicz is a\\nlawyer and founder of a campaign group called the Free Courts Initiative. MICHAL WAWRYKIEWICZ: Independence of judiciary\\nis one of the grounds of the democracy. If the courts are not independent and the\\njudges are not independent, then we have a very serious problem with the democracy. ELZBIETA JASTRZEBOWSKA, Archaeologist: We\\nare old enough to remember how it was under the Soviet regime. And, right now, it is incomprehensible to\\nme that this is repeated now, even worse. JAKUB KOCJAN, Democratic Action: The rest\\nof the world should be worried about Poland\\'s democracy, because it\\'s the model of Turkey\\nand Hungary, where judges are not independent, which really means dictatorship. ELZBIETA JASTRZEBOWSKA: Under the Soviets,\\nwe normal people, we knew that the papers were lying, that the TV is lying. MALCOLM BRABANT: The liberal newspaper Gazeta\\nWyborcza sprang from the venerated solidarity labor movement of the 1980s, pivotal in the\\ncollapse of communism in Poland and across the former Soviet Bloc. But the paper is feeling the squeeze. Government entities have pulled advertising. Its reporters have been denied access. VADIM MAKARENKO, Gazeta Wyborcza: It\\'s pretty\\nsimilar to America. The media are being demonized by the government. They\\'re calling us fake news every time we\\'re\\nbeing critical towards the government. MALCOLM BRABANT: Vadim Makarenko is a senior\\neditor at Gazeta Wyborcza. VADIM MAKARENKO We have state-owned television\\nwhich is bringing propaganda to Polish households. My newspaper appeals to the European Union\\nmore or less regularly, asking it to preserve media freedom in Poland, as well as judiciary\\nindependence. ZDZISLAW KRASNODEBSKI, European Parliament:\\nBased on the distorting and distorted image of Poland, I consider this as fake news of\\nthis century. MALCOLM BRABANT: Zdzislaw Krasnodebski is\\na member of the European parliament, and an influential member of Poland\\'s Law and Justice\\nParty. ZDZISLAW KRASNODEBSKI: It is rubbish to say\\nthat in Poland we have any slide towards autocracy or any danger, profound danger to democracy. Of course, our democracy is not perfect, but\\nI think British is not perfect and German is not perfect. MALCOLM BRABANT: Despite the concerns, Poland\\nof today is nothing like it was behind the Iron Curtain. There are no troops on the streets, and the\\npolice did not disrupt the protests over the courts. Nevertheless, alarm bells are ringing. PAWEL MARCZEWSKI, Batory Foundation: I believe\\nwhat government is doing can be potentially dangerous. MALCOLM BRABANT: Pawel Marczewski is an analyst\\nwith the Batory Foundation, established by American philanthropist George Soros to promote\\nopen democratic societies in Poland and across Central Europe. PAWEL MARCZEWSKI: I do not believe that they\\'re\\noffering enough space in the public discourse to dissenting voices. I think that they\\'re trying to build a monolithic\\npolitical culture in Poland, a culture that is based basically on the Catholic faith and\\na certain vision of Polish history, a very heroic version of Polish history, a simplistic\\nvision of Polish history. MALCOLM BRABANT: Such as the music of Frederic\\nChopin, Poland\\'s greatest composer and this key monument, the Warsaw Rising Memorial,\\nhonoring 63 days in 1944 when patriots fought in vain against the Nazis. Behind is a modern battleground, the Supreme\\nCourt. Last year, the Polish government forced 40\\npercent of the court\\'s judges to retire early, in a move the European Commission condemned\\nas illegal. A change in leadership at the top of the European\\nUnion in Brussels is now under way. And that could make it a lot harder for countries\\nlike Poland to resist Pan-European laws and values. The new European Commission is determined\\nto stop what\\'s been called democratic backsliding. So, in the future, member states will be subject\\nto an annual review to make sure they\\'re abiding by the rules. In the 15 years since Brussels admitted nations\\nfrom the former Soviet Bloc, business in Poland has boomed, boosted by $14 billion worth of\\nEuropean funds for state-of-the-art infrastructure. It\\'s now the sixth largest economy in the\\nE.U. The implicit warning from Brussels is that,\\nunless Poland behaves, the money will dry up. But such sanctions have been threatened before\\nand, according to some E.U. officials, have had no impact. ADAM BALCER, Foreign Affairs Analyst: I think\\nthat Poland is going to resist the pressure of the European mainstream. MALCOLM BRABANT: Foreign affairs analyst Adam\\nBalcer believes the governing Law and Justice Party will easily win this autumn\\'s forthcoming\\ngeneral election and will be emboldened as a result. ADAM BALCER: They are going to have more than\\n50 percent of the seats in Parliament. And, of course, they count a lot on the support\\nof the United States, which definitely, in the case of this administration, is very supportive\\nof this type of governments in the European Union. MALCOLM BRABANT: President Trump looks favorably\\non Poland, not least because it meets his requirement that NATO members spend at least\\n2 percent of GDP on national defense. DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States:\\nThe United States and Poland continue to enhance our security cooperation. Poland will still provide basing and infrastructure\\nto support military presence of about 1,000 American troops. The Polish government will build these projects\\nat no cost to the United States. The Polish government will pay for this. We thank President Duda and the people of\\nPoland for their partnership in advancing our common security. MALCOLM BRABANT: Poland is planning to buy\\n32 American F-35 Lightning stealth fighters, total cost, $2.5 billion. President Andrzej Duda was given a personal\\nflyover at the White House last month. And in what some critics label an act of outright\\nsycophancy, Duda intends to call the new American base on Polish soil Fort Trump. ANDRZEJ DUDA, Polish President (through translator):\\nOne of the agreements I signed personally concerned security and military cooperation. As you mentioned, sir, there will be more\\nAmerican troops in Poland. There\\'s going to be an enhanced cooperation. MALCOLM BRABANT: So could the bond with the\\nWhite House thwart the E.U.\\'s intention to force Poland to conform? Building Fort Trump on Polish soil would have\\na propaganda effect in any confrontation with Russia. PAWEL MARCZEWSKI: But I do believe this is\\naimed at strengthening Polish position within the E.U., not as a serious alternative to\\na strong Polish position in the E.U. MALCOLM BRABANT: This month, Poland has been\\ncourting the leaders of Lithuania and Slovakia. It\\'s trying to forge alliances within the\\nE.U. to challenge the dominance of France and Germany. If and when Brexit happens, Poland could become\\nmore powerful within the E.U. The loss of Britain\\'s moderating presence\\ncould make it harder to stop the Poles from marching off the designated course. For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I\\'m Malcolm Brabant\\nin Warsaw.',\n",
       " \"Coal-rich Poland has the most\\npolluted air in the European Union. Every single person in\\nSilesia knows someone who basically died\\nbecause of the pollution. Yet many are\\nreluctant to depart from the tradition\\nand security of its pits. At the same time, a new\\ngeneration of climate activists are fighting to consign\\nfossil fuels to history. Our government has been one\\nof the most strongly blocking, all of the climate policies, plans\\nand ideas in the whole of Europe. But with the decline\\nof coal seen as vital to our hopes of avoiding the worst\\nof the impending climate crisis, what\\xa0happens in Poland has implications\\nfar beyond the country's borders. These two coal mines\\nare the last two slated to be open in\\nthe whole of Europe. As a visual metaphor for\\nthe scale of the problem, you've got a mountain\\nin front of you. Everything off? I need to eat more dumplings. I'm at the Jankowice of coal mine,\\nin the industrial Silesian city of Rybnik. One of\\xa0the two mines not\\nscheduled to close until 2049. Easy to get lost. Before my visit, I had heard that high\\xa0levels \\nof methane emitted at the mine, might force its\\nclosure much sooner. But 700 metres\\xa0underground,\\nthe prevailing mood is one of defiance. What happens when these\\nmines do close, what will you do? Yeah, yeah, OK. Get out the way. The return of\\xa0this\\ntrainload of miners from the coalface some\\nfour kilometres away, heralds the changing\\nof a shift. How long will these men\\xa0\\nhave been down in the mine? Six hours? There's a lot of men\\nworking down here, will they all find jobs after\\nthe coal mines close? Although the miners here\\ncontinue to extract around 2 million tons\\nof coal every year, Other miners in Silesia\\nhave already experienced the hard reality of this\\nshutdown process. I'm on my way to Zabrze,\\nto the north of Rybnik, where the Makoszowy mine\\nhas already been closed and is in\\xa0the process of\\nbeing decommissioned. I'm going to meet trade union\\nleader, Andrzej Chwiluk, who has a bit of\\na fight on his hands. It must have been incredibly\\ndifficult for you personally to have watched over\\nthe years this thriving mine slowly become\\nwhat we see today. This is my office. Ah, this is your office? What is\\xa0the most important\\nthing you are looking for here? Andrzej shows me his\\nceremonial uniform. A source of great pride in spite\\nof all that has happened. Looking good. And just\\xa0in time to welcome\\ntoday's real guests. Here in Zabrze an unlikely alliance has\\nformed between Andrzej's trade unionists and these 'Fridays for Future'\\nclimate activists. You've met Andrzej before? I was so scared of Andrzej. But on paper you\\nare enemies, right? They are being shown to us\\nby the government as those who are just opposing\\nany change and like, nothing can\\nhappen here in Poland, because the miners\\nwill just go crazy. The miners and the activists\\nhave united over a concept known as the just transition. Which aims to create\\na sustainable green economy, whilst also protecting\\xa0\\nworkers and livelihoods. These people who\\nhave to say goodbye to the way they've\\nworked for years. We really need to listen to\\nthem and talk to each other and like find out what we can do\\nto finally achieve a just transition. Fantastic, good for you. I think we've all learned\\nsomething today. Yeah, all right,\\nlet's go, go, go, OK. We've got to go. Andrzej is taking us\\ninto Lower Silesia to a region where the closure\\nof the mines a few decades ago have caused a lot\\xa0of problems\\nfor the local people. What's your role here,\\ndo you think? Our role is to inform the people\\nabout, first of all, the crisis and to mobilise people\\xa0for the\\nsolutions and we have to figure out how to phase out coal in Poland. I want to understand what\\xa0\\nmistakes we must not do. Does this feel like a kind\\nof a fight back against the kind\\xa0of divide and rule\\napproach to governance? The first time that we met\\nwith Andrzej in Makoszowy, I remember we posted like on\\nsocial media that, you know, we're here, we're talking\\xa0\\nand then we put it out and people were like, what? That's insane. That's when it's so powerful, when we like,\\xa0really believe that\\njustice has to kind of like, serve us all. During their visit\\xa0to this\\nregion, Wiktoria and Dominika are meeting miners, activists\\nand politicians alike, building contacts and\\nknowledge and of course, sharing their experiences\\nthrough social media. We're like in this moment of real\\ntransition right now, in building the new. And this new system\\ncan be amazing, but it doesn't require only\\nyoung people to build that, we need all of these\\npeople on board. Despite the state-owned mines\\nresisting further closures,  houses that once relied\\nentirely on coal for heating,  are now being reprimanded\\nfor contributing to some of the highest\\xa0\\nlevels of air pollution in the EU. Back in Rybnik deputy mayor,\\nPiotr Masłowski, hopes this approach offers an\\nexample of the just transition in action. We're following the municipal\\nguard on an eco patrol where they drive around\\nand look out for signs of things being\\xa0burnt that\\nshouldn't be in households. I think that's a no. The city offers incentives\\nto encourage residents to move away from\\ntheir coal burners. With the older more harmful\\nsmokers already banned. Oh yeah, look. Here in Rybnik there is a big movement \\nto get rid of this type of burner and move to cleaner\\nsources of energy. But Poland's legacy of coal\\nisn't confined underground. What is this place? At this slag site, \\nonce a fishing pond, a local\\xa0scavenger searches\\nfor treasure amongst the refuse. What's this? Why do you feel it is that people\\nlike yourself have to come down here to get your heating source? With energy costs driven\\nskyward by the war in Ukraine, this revolution\\xa0away from\\ncoal, once seen as vital to Poland's independence\\nfrom Soviet influence, is at risk of\\xa0stalling\\nbefore it has even begun. You must feel some\\nresponsibility to try and improve the lot\\nfor people like this? No, I do not know his situation. I'm not sure we can\\noffer them new jobs. Generally\\xa0I try to focus on the kids,\\nI know that it sounds terrible that I decide to leave maybe\\xa0\\n5% of the population behind. But if you want to achieve a goal\\nwe have to invest in the future. But many local\\nresidents are miners and as such still receive perks like\\nfree coal to heat their homes. You are surrounded by\\na strong mining industry and a lot of union members\\nwho have no incentive to leave coal behind. Poland remains well behind the rest\\nof Europe in transitioning away from coal, with little cause for optimism\\nahead of elections later this year, but places like Rybnik with \\nmore progressive local leaders are showing it\\xa0is possible\\nto address the damage the coal industry has caused. And as miners and activists\\xa0continue\\nto push collectively for change, there is a growing recognition that\\nwhen it comes to the climate crisis, we really are all in it together.\",\n",

POLAND HAS NOT HISTORICALLY  BEEN A PLACE THAT HAS BEEN  WELCOMING TO REFUGEES.

steep\\xa0\\xa0 trying to film while climbing up without\\xa0\\nfalling down it's a bit of a challenge oh my god you made it all the way up bit\\xa0\\nwindy up here it's nice though because it kind of\\xa0\\xa0 cools you down again wow you have\\xa0\\nthe most amazing view up here\\xa0\\xa0 you can see the vistula river that's the\\xa0\\nriver that also flows through Kraków i believe\\xa0\\xa0 we have seen this river there and other than that\\xa0\\nyou can see the entire medieval town of Toruń\\xa0\\xa0 which is by the way a unesco world heritage\\xa0\\nthe entire old town is a unesco world heritage excuse me please how beautiful is this building\\xa0\\nthat we're currently looking onto and i have been\\xa0\\xa0 actually really interested in this building since\\xa0\\nyesterday evening when i first saw it it is from\\xa0\\xa0 1311 and it's one of these red brick buildings\\xa0\\nthat just looks absolutely insane i think by now\\xa0\\xa0 it kind of looks like it's commercially used\\xa0\\na lot of these like very very historically\\xa0\\xa0 looking buildings are used for museums or\\xa0\\nsome sort of like cultural exhibitions or arts\\xa0\\xa0 or something like that this one specifically\\xa0\\nthat i like so much is used commercially\\xa0\\xa0 but it is so nice to look at i genuinely can't\\xa0\\nthink of anything more fantastic to do as a\\xa0\\xa0 as the first thing when we arrived here this is\\xa0\\nout of this world um by far already the coolest\\xa0\\xa0 tower that we've been on since we started\\xa0\\ntraveling the views from up here are just\\xa0\\xa0 they just take your breath away i'm actually kind\\xa0\\nof almost lost for words just looking out at this and as naomi said unesco world heritage\\xa0\\nsite the medieval town of Toruń this place\\xa0\\xa0 is somewhere that we have had on our list now ever\\xa0\\nsince we arrived in poland and we've been getting\\xa0\\xa0 comments under our videos for such a long time\\xa0\\nsaying you need to go to Toruń you need to check\\xa0\\xa0 out the medieval town of Toruń and that's why\\xa0\\nwe came here we're here for quite some time now\\xa0\\xa0 we have a good few days booked in this beautiful\\xa0\\nplace and we should be able to bring you guys\\xa0\\xa0 some really nice videos and sort of give you\\xa0\\nour true impressions of what this place is like\\xa0\\xa0 different things that you can do while\\xa0\\nyou're here different things you can see\\xa0\\xa0 and there is absolutely an unbelievable amount of\\xa0\\nthings that you can do a lot of them are for free\\xa0\\xa0 a lot of them you can buy tickets for but let's\\xa0\\ngo and explore some more of this amazing medieval\\xa0\\xa0 town oh wow okay we're gonna take a little bit of\\xa0\\na pit stop here at a coffee shop uh near to the\\xa0\\xa0 main medieval square of Toruń Menzen pub we're\\xa0\\ngonna grab a quick cup of coffee and maybe a tea\\xa0\\xa0 and just enjoy this beautiful day here for maybe\\xa0\\nan hour or so and then we're going to continue\\xa0\\xa0 exploring the great medieval city of Toruń\\xa0\\nwe picked the absolute perfect place to drink a\\xa0\\xa0 coffee here we have a perfect view onto the statue\\xa0\\nof copernicus who was by the way born in Toruń\\xa0\\xa0 so a lot of the things here around the town are\\xa0\\naround copernicus so you have like i think a\\xa0\\xa0 copernicus museum and stuff like that so we have\\xa0\\nthe perfect view onto the statue and it's just\\xa0\\xa0 such an idyllic and absolutely amazing day in the\\xa0\\nsun doesn't get much better than this guys this is\\xa0\\xa0 perfect right now now the city of Toruń is known\\xa0\\nfor two things in particular nicholas copernicus\\xa0\\xa0 and gingerbread now those are two pretty random\\xa0\\nthings but when it comes to Toruń it makes a\\xa0\\xa0 whole bunch of sense nicholas copernicus was an\\xa0\\nabsolutely brilliant mind and he was someone who\\xa0\\xa0 basically discovered the theory that planets\\xa0\\nrevolve around the sun and throughout history\\xa0\\xa0 he has been revered as one of the fantastic\\xa0\\nminds throughout history all throughout history\\xa0\\xa0 gingerbread on the other hand this place is known\\xa0\\nas the city of gingerbread and there's actually\\xa0\\xa0 a gingerbread museum where you can apparently\\xa0\\ngo and make your own gingerbread so that is\\xa0\\xa0 on our list and we cannot wait to go and give\\xa0\\nthat a shot directly here on the main square\\xa0\\xa0 of Toruń you will find this golden donkey here\\xa0\\nthat was put here in the year 2007 and it is\\xa0\\xa0 supposed to look similar to the one that was here\\xa0\\nin medieval times back then however it was used\\xa0\\xa0 as a torturing method we read that soldiers like\\xa0\\nthis disobedient soldiers were put on the donkey\\xa0\\xa0 with weights on their legs in order to torture\\xa0\\nthem now it is a golden donkey where a lot of\\xa0\\xa0 people take pictures with and rub their ears so\\xa0\\ndefinitely a must-see of the city of Toruń right\\xa0\\xa0 now we are at the old gate of Toruń and this\\xa0\\nwas erected in the first half of the 14th century\\xa0\\xa0 in a gothic style this is actually the only\\xa0\\ngate leading out of the old town to the west\\xa0\\xa0 and in the 15th century a barbican was built by\\xa0\\nit in the forum of a circular tower five to six\\xa0\\xa0 stories high so it would have been a fantastic\\xa0\\nviewpoint as a form of defense over Toruń and it\\xa0\\xa0 was strengthened with a moat and a drawbridge too\\xa0\\nmissiles were actually hurled and boiling water\\xa0\\xa0 was poured on the besiegers through special\\xa0\\nopenings on the protruding top floor gallery\\xa0\\xa0 the barricade was eventually destroyed the swedish\\xa0\\narmies during the siege of 1703 and the tower gate\\xa0\\xa0 was dismantled as well in the late 1880s so that\\xa0\\nthere alone is a ton of history and this is just\\xa0\\xa0 one tiny part of toronto so right now there's not\\xa0\\na whole lot of that gate left you still have some\\xa0\\xa0 parts of the defensive walls here directly behind\\xa0\\nme and the opening itself where people would have\\xa0\\xa0 come into the city or went out of the city and\\xa0\\nwith a lot of imagination and the pictures that\\xa0\\xa0 are shown on the sign over there you can really\\xa0\\nimagine what this area would have looked like\\xa0\\xa0 if you walk a little bit further down you will\\xa0\\nfind the leaning tower of Toruń which was built\\xa0\\xa0 in this very very specific way because one of the\\xa0\\nteutonic knights was dating the beautiful daughter\\xa0\\xa0 of a very wealthy merchant and he was not supposed\\xa0\\nto date this daughter or he fell in love with that\\xa0\\xa0 woman actually so to speak and it was built in\\xa0\\nthis way because of his crooked ways of living\\xa0\\xa0 so right now we are at gate of the holy spirit\\xa0\\nor otherwise known as convent gate and this leads\\xa0\\xa0 directly out here onto the vistula river it's\\xa0\\nactually a perfect sort of a gateway between\\xa0\\xa0 the medieval town and the vistula river both\\xa0\\nways both directions will take you to something\\xa0\\xa0 equally beautiful and stunning and if you do come\\xa0\\nduring the summer which we highly recommend you\\xa0\\xa0 do come to Toruń in the summertime if you can\\xa0\\nbecause the weather is absolutely perfect and the\\xa0\\xa0 views out here onto the vistula river is just\\xa0\\nsomething else and then take a walk in to the\\xa0\\xa0 unesco world heritage site of the medieval town\\xa0\\nof Toruń and have yourself a little bit of\\xa0\\xa0 of an exploration around stuttering over\\xa0\\nmy words but they used this gate itself to\\xa0\\xa0 actually hurl boiling water and hot porridge down\\xa0\\nonto their enemies or attackers of the fortress\\xa0\\xa0 can you imagine here you can see the original\\xa0\\ndoors directly beside me and you can really see\\xa0\\xa0 how small people were back then like barely\\xa0\\nthe original door barely touches my shoulder\\xa0\\xa0 i think i would have been too big\\xa0\\nfor Toruń in the medieval times if it is getting too hot inside the city of\\xa0\\nToruń you have obviously the vistula river\\xa0\\xa0 here on the side as well where you can do little\\xa0\\ncruises with these like cute little boats and\\xa0\\xa0 on the other side of the vistula river\\xa0\\nyou can see there there's a lot of nature\\xa0\\xa0 and also small beaches and right now there's even\\xa0\\npeople swimming there so i feel like Toruń kind\\xa0\\xa0 of has it all it has everything to offer that\\xa0\\nyou could need for a summer destination i totally\\xa0\\xa0 agree with naomi this is truly the perfect summer\\xa0\\ndestination if you are making a list add Toruń\\xa0\\xa0 to it immediately if you're coming here come here\\xa0\\nduring the summer there is a beautiful very very\\xa0\\xa0 long sort of promenade all along the vistula river\\xa0\\nso i'd say there's nothing better than to just\\xa0\\xa0 take a nice walk on a sunny sunday or saturday\\xa0\\nafternoon and then stop off in the medieval town\\xa0\\xa0 and have yourself a nice cold piwo in one of the\\xa0\\nmany bars and restaurants in there now gingerbread\\xa0\\xa0 really does run deep in the veins of the city\\xa0\\nof Toruń it is or what i've read is that\\xa0\\xa0 gingerbread was actually gifted to people such as\\xa0\\npope john paul ii by far the best pope in history\\xa0\\xa0 if you ask me it is also gifted to plenty of kings\\xa0\\nand knights and nobel prize winners throughout\\xa0\\xa0 history as sort of sort of a sign of appreciation\\xa0\\nfor the work that these brilliant people do\\xa0\\xa0 and to be honest i wouldn't be sad if i received\\xa0\\na gift basket of delicious gingerbread for doing\\xa0\\xa0 a good job it's always very hard to get across\\xa0\\njust how beautiful certain places are and this\\xa0\\xa0 is one of those places where we just want to\\xa0\\nreach through the camera and pull you guys in\\xa0\\xa0 and just to let you experience the\\xa0\\ntrue and utter authentic beauty of\\xa0\\xa0 this polish city it is unmatched to be completely\\xa0\\nhonest yeah walking the streets of Toruń\\xa0\\xa0 certainly feels like you're just walking in a\\xa0\\nmedieval fairy tale kind of um i would love just\\xa0\\xa0 like for one day to put on like a princess dress\\xa0\\nor something and luke can be a knight for one day\\xa0\\xa0 and then we'll walk the streets here and have the\\xa0\\nmost amazing day ever by the way if you ever see\\xa0\\xa0 us walking the streets of poland or in any other\\xa0\\ncountry don't hesitate and come up to us and just\\xa0\\xa0 say hello we're very very happy to speak to you\\xa0\\nguys and just grab a cup of coffee or something\\xa0\\xa0 somewhere definitely don't hesitate to approach us\\xa0\\nbut now on to the gingerbread museum where we are\\xa0\\xa0 hopefully going to make our own gingerbread i know\\xa0\\nthis is a gingerbread museum but how stinking cute\\xa0\\xa0 is this you have these little chairs that just\\xa0\\nlooks like gingerbread with a little bit of icing\\xa0\\xa0 and you even have a massive gingerbread house here\\xa0\\nit's so cute so the gingerbread workshop that we\\xa0\\xa0 booked it is going to be entirely in polish\\xa0\\nso unfortunately we're not going to understand\\xa0\\xa0 the majority of what's going on but we\\xa0\\nfigured we are just going to basically copy\\xa0\\xa0 what other people beside us are doing so it\\xa0\\nshould be a fun experience nonetheless we cannot\\xa0\\xa0 wait to design our own gingerbread men let's\\xa0\\ndo this okay so you can change the shape you\\xa0\\xa0 can go around choose what you like one mould\\xa0\\nokay so take the shape okay do you want to put It's a very special gingerbread because in Toruń we actually have  two types of gingerbreads so the first type\\xa0\\nis gingerbread for eating that you probably know\\xa0\\xa0 but the second type is a little bit different it is a \\xa0\\ntraditional decoration type of gingerbread that is called\\xa0\\xa0 goście from the polish word for visitors and\\xa0\\nthis gingerbread is just for decoration so not\\xa0\\xa0 for eating and we are making these gingerbreads\\xa0\\nlike from the middle ages almost 300 years now\\xa0\\xa0 and this is really really important tradition\\xa0\\nin Toruń and we are not eating this dough\\xa0\\xa0 because in this dough there's like four times\\xa0\\nmore flour and oil than in this normal one\\xa0\\xa0 so if you eat this probably a few\\xa0\\nnext days you will spend in the bathroom after a week we can have two weeks they are\\xa0\\ngoing to be really hard like this so if you\\xa0\\xa0 will keep them safe for this time you can even\\xa0\\nhave it for so many for many years in home i have\\xa0\\xa0 these ones that are like five years old now\\xa0\\nnothing is happening with them so every year\\xa0\\xa0 they're hanged on the christmas tree as a polish\\ntradition and gingerbreads like this you can also\\xa0\\xa0 decorate you can paint them with paints or some\\xa0\\nglue with glitter or maybe some more artistic like\\xa0\\xa0 decoupage fake gold decoration as you want but if\\xa0\\nyou want to have this gingerbread for many years\\xa0\\xa0 probably better is to like conservate them\\xa0\\nwith even a hairspray or some like a vernix for\\xa0\\xa0 decoration things yeah so you can try to do\\xa0\\nthat because of course the worms also like food because our dough can stick to\\xa0\\nit we need a little bit of oil\\xa0\\xa0 and so when you take your brush you\\xa0\\nneed to push it to the walls because\\xa0\\xa0 too much oil is not good because nothing\\xa0\\nwill appear on the dough and you're gonna so it should be just a little shiny - just add a little bit of oil The Gingerbread comes from the Factory, where it is resting for 3 months before it is coming to us and so the dough is a little bit hard that's why we\\xa0\\nneed to squeeze that because it needs to be more\\xa0\\xa0 elastic and a little bit sticky so you need to\\xa0\\ntake that in hand and don't play though you need\\xa0\\xa0 to squeeze until the flour will disappear and\\xa0\\nit doesn't stick into your fingers okay so okay so you have to knead the dough until it gets kind of sticky as you maybe saw\\xa0\\nin the video in the beginning it had a little\\xa0\\xa0 bit of flour on the outside maybe if you can\\xa0\\ngrab the dough over there so this is what it\\xa0\\xa0 looked like at the beginning and now it looks\\xa0\\nlike this and the dough should be a little bit\\xa0\\xa0 sticky so that it kind of sticks to your hand\\xa0\\nand then it's ready to go because this dough\\xa0\\xa0 is coming from the copernicus factory\\xa0\\nfrom what the woman said and it's kind of\\xa0\\xa0 it's there for like three months until it gets\\xa0\\nhere so the dough is a little bit hard and you\\xa0\\xa0 just have to work with it for a while until you\\xa0\\ncan actually do something with it and okay so\\xa0\\xa0 this is a test when you squeeze it hard and you\\xa0\\nopen the hand if it's sticky it's good if it's\\xa0\\xa0 falling it's not good but please do not do like\\xa0\\nthis yeah your fingers cannot be in the dough actually this test is checking two things\\xa0\\xa0 if the dough is ready and if i can put you\\xa0\\nin the dungeons for you to make the gingerbread if your dough is sticky to make a ball from it one\\xa0\\nmore time okay at least so it's more elastic and\\xa0\\xa0 our shapes we don't know how to hold our dough but\\xa0\\nit's sticky i think it will stick to this rolling pin so for that not to happen we need a little\\xa0\\nbit of our magical white powder so flour that's why we are going to put our\\xa0\\ndough inside the cup with flour\\xa0\\xa0 and just shake it okay and what will stick\\xa0\\nto it will be enough shake it shake it that's why it needs to cover only your\\xa0\\nshape and a little frame not the whole\\xa0\\xa0 mould and be bigger than mould okay because\\xa0\\nthen you will need to start from over and\\xa0\\xa0 there is really important one\\xa0\\nthing when you will put your dough\\xa0\\xa0 on the mould check if your dough is on the\\xa0\\nright side not on the left okay right side oh god your gingerbread and somebody\\xa0\\nelse's and i see a lot of hearts in here\\xa0\\xa0 and we need to sign our gingerbread so with the knife\\xa0\\xa0 in the center of your gingerbread you\\xa0\\nneed to write your initials address so what what do you think of the experience\\xa0\\nso far you've got flower on your nose white powder on my nose no i'm only joking this\\xa0\\nexperience is absolutely amazing and the lady\\xa0\\xa0 was so kind as well to do it in english and polish\\xa0\\nbecause there was not so many people around here\\xa0\\xa0 and i just think i don't know over the top\\xa0\\nhappy i can't wait to hold my own gingerbread\\xa0\\xa0 yeah i went for the more\\xa0\\ntraditional route of doing like the\\xa0\\xa0 um the stamp of Toruń or the coat of arms of\\xa0\\nToruń and it came out actually it came out\\xa0\\xa0 pretty well i applied a little bit too much force\\xa0\\nwhen i was rolling on it but thankfully it came\\xa0\\xa0 out pretty good she's basically gonna go and bake\\xa0\\nour gingerbread now and this is not for eating\\xa0\\xa0 but there is a taste test somewhere on the first\\xa0\\nfloor so we're gonna go and try some gingerbread\\xa0\\xa0 wait second gingerbread of the day we by the\\xa0\\nway we didn't have any food today we just had\\xa0\\xa0 a gingerbread that you saw at the beginning of the\\xa0\\nvideo and now we're going to have that gingerbread\\xa0\\xa0 it's half past four yeah we're living the staple\\xa0\\ndiet of the people of Toruń it's gingerbread for\\xa0\\xa0 breakfast lunch and dinner some coffee in between\\xa0\\nwe're getting up now to the tasting section of the\\xa0\\xa0 gingerbread museum and i don't know about you but\\xa0\\ni'm pretty hungry so let's get some gingerbread\\xa0\\xa0 excited for the gingerbread oh i'd like to make\\xa0\\nan emergency order of 10 kilograms of gingerbread\\xa0\\xa0 thank you for sure, no problem the moment we've all been waiting for\\xa0\\nwe're gonna taste test some amazing gingerbread\\xa0\\xa0 you have your piece gingerbread this\\xa0\\nis called katarzynka by the way cheers to Toruń to poland and to\\xa0\\nall of you watching our channel thank you so much so nice i think my my gingerbread\\xa0\\nlooks a little bit not so good well the weather is still amazing it Luke's words: pathetic let's inspect luke's shape here we go guys i don't know if you\\xa0\\ncan see anything but there we go Toruń\\xa0\\xa0 nice not too not too shabby if you don't mind\\xa0\\nme saying didn't come out exactly perfect\\xa0\\xa0 but nonetheless this is definitely going to be a\\xa0\\nsouvenir souvenirs that me and naomi will cherish\\xa0\\xa0 for a very very long time from this city now today\\xa0\\nwe learned loads and loads of things but one of\\xa0\\xa0 the things for sure is that it's very difficult\\xa0\\nto make a nice gingerbread so definitely i have\\xa0\\xa0 to take my hat off for the people with my respect\\xa0\\nthat make nice gingerbread because i am not the\\xa0\\xa0 person but anyway this is day one completed from\\xa0\\nToruń stay tuned because we're going to see you\\xa0\\xa0 guys tomorrow this is a video that we're going to\\xa0\\nshoot over several days so i think we have another\\xa0\\xa0 like three or four days to come here in Toruń\\xa0\\nplenty more exploring see you tomorrow morning\",\n",
       " \"good morning peoples here from Zenowiz and\\xa0\\nyou'd think we're in Poland already with\\xa0\\xa0 that name but we're not we're still in Germany\\xa0\\nalmost the most northeastern part and there\\xa0\\xa0 on that tip lies Poland that's where we're going\\xa0\\nto go in a minute right up the coast for real this\\xa0\\xa0 time i hope into a country that i've never been\\xa0\\nto before with our companion of the last couple\\xa0\\xa0 of days so behind us the baltic sea that stretches\\xa0\\nall the way up to the baltic countries of course\\xa0\\xa0 also known in dutch as the Eastsea this is\\xa0\\nwhere the vikings roamed back in the day have you been polishing up your polish uh all right so let's get out of germany now and be the most\\xa0\\nnorth eastern i've ever been i think there we go\\xa0\\xa0 motorcycles are the best so let's go to the polsky so about eight kilometers from the polish border\\xa0\\noh look at that and the architecture already\\xa0\\xa0 begins to change because look at this this is\\xa0\\nthe cool thing about being out here because\\xa0\\xa0 you know used to be german used to be polish\\xa0\\nused to be german you know complicated history but also you know used to be eastern germany\\xa0\\nused to be soviet union we're going to see a lot\\xa0\\xa0 more of this in poland i reckon oh\\xa0\\nthey built the elevator afterwards so more soviet blockish eastern blockish\\xa0\\nbuildings poland is another country from\\xa0\\xa0 that soviet era because it was for a while\\xa0\\noccupied or a satellite state of the soviet\\xa0\\xa0 union and that's really cool in a way the\\xa0\\nhistoric aspect of it because i've been\\xa0\\xa0 in more than a few countries like that of\\xa0\\ncourse i've been to russia i rode all the way\\xa0\\xa0 to the eastern end of it vladivostok ventura\\xa0\\nromania hungary other countries in the balkans and\\xa0\\xa0 also georgia armenia there you can really really\\xa0\\nsee that soviet era history some old machinery\\xa0\\xa0 the the vehicles the buildings and it's\\xa0\\nfascinating it's fantastic to see so i\\xa0\\xa0 always enjoy to see that soviet era history in\\xa0\\nthose countries so we're going to see a little\\xa0\\xa0 bit more of that i wonder though on the coast\\xa0\\nbecause that's commercialized area of poland um\\xa0\\xa0 yeah every it's uh it's that time of the\\xa0\\nyear again all the bikes are riding for it if we end up in a drag race i can actually\\xa0\\nwin here this little bit of off-road after\\xa0\\xa0 that not so much i don't think she's stuck\\xa0\\nokay fair enough i wanted to record him going or maybe some uh polish viewers\\xa0\\nout there are like no man that's\\xa0\\xa0 still how we build but i can't\\xa0\\nimagine we're going to the prom i asked you uh to go to the prom want to come to\\xa0\\nthe prom with me wait are these zlotties already yeah it looks like it wait are we in poland\\xa0\\nor germany i thought poland would only be\\xa0\\xa0 on the other side everything's in polish\\xa0\\nalready when you get directly into poland\\xa0\\xa0 you can cross little river on a little ferry\\xa0\\nthat's what we're gonna do there she is\\xa0\\xa0

changes\\xa0\\xa0 simply for me getting into germany already\\xa0\\nfrees my mind freeze my whole being compared\\xa0\\xa0 to when you're in the netherlands i said it\\xa0\\nbefore there's no country more organized in\\xa0\\xa0 the world than the netherlands and then when you\\xa0\\nget to countries where everything just opens up\\xa0\\xa0 the architecture changes the way things\\xa0\\nare positioned everything is more random it\\xa0\\xa0 feels great good for the soul i like to say still\\xa0\\nalways takes me by surprise a bit even though i've\\xa0\\xa0 experienced it so many times

       " \"GOOD EVENING AGAIN FROM WARSAW, GOOD EVENING AGAIN FROM WARSAW, POLAND. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US FROM THE NEXT HOUR. LET ME SKETCH OUT A SITUATION FOR YOU AND ASK YOU IF IT SOUNDS FAMILIAR. RUSSIA BEGINS AMASSING TROOPS ON ANOTHER COUNTRY'S BORDERS. THE UNITED STATES CALLS OUT RUSSIA'S BELLIGERENT MOVES AND WARNS IT NOT TO INVADE. EVERYONE IS ON EDGE. WONDERING IF RUSSIA IS ABOUT TO INVADE, AND IF SO, HOW THE UNITED STATES WILL RESPOND. I COULD, OF COURSE, BE DESCRIBING THE SITUATION LEADING UP TO THE UKRAINE LAST MONTH. BUT ACTUALLY, I'M DESCRIBING WHAT WAS HAPPENING RIGHT HERE IN THIS COUNTRY, IN POLAND, IN 1980. >> GOOD EVENING. POLAND AND THE POSSIBILITY OF SOVIET MILITARY INTERVENTION WAS THE SUBJECT OF AN UNUSUAL WHITE HOUSE DEMON THIS AFTERNOON. IN THAT STATEMENT, PRESIDENT CARTER SAID, THE UNITED STATES IS WATCHING WITH GROWING CONCERN THE UNPRECEDENTED BUILDUP OF SOVIET FORCES ALONG THE POLISH BORDER AND THE CLOSING OF CERTAIN FRONTIER REGIONS. THE STATEMENT ALSO SAID THAT MILITARY INTERVENTION IN POLAND WOULD HAVE THE MOST NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. >> SENIOR OFFICIALS ARE OPERATING ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE LAST THING THE RUSSIANS WANT TO DO IS INVADE POLAND, RECOGNIZING AN INVASION WILL MAKE EVERYTHING MUCH WORSE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THE RUSSIANS CONTINUE TO INCREASE THEIR MILITARY PRESSURE ON POLAND. FOR EXAMPLE, ON BOTH SIDES OF THE EAST GERMAN POLISH BORDER, A 40 MILE WARD STRIP HAS BEEN CLOSED TO FOREIGN OBSERVERS. THERE ARE TEN SOVIET DIVISIONS ABOUT 100,000 TROOPS IN THIS AREA. ON POLAND'S EASTERN FRONT, FROM THE BALTIC MILITARY DISTRICT IN THE NORTH TO THE CARPATHIAN IN THE SOUTH, -- FORCES ARE IN WET OFFICIALS HERE CALL AND ENHANCED STATE OF READINESS. >> THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE PART OF EUROPE, THE WEST -- HAVE BEEN MADE CLEAR TO THE SOVIET LEADERSHIP. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CHANNELS. >> THIS STANDOFF WITH THE SOVIET UNION WAS SPARKED BY THE SUCCESS OF A -- PRO DEMOCRACY HERE IN POLAND, A PRO DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT HERE IN POLAND. YOU WILL REMEMBER, IT THE SOLIDARITY MOVEMENT. IT BEGAN AS LABOR STRIKES IN A POLISH SHIPYARD AND QUICKLY GREW INTO A NATIONAL PHENOMENON UNDER ITS CHARISMATIC LEADER, LET VALENCIA. THE COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT IN POLAND BEING FORCED INTO COMPROMISES WITH THESE DEMOCRATIC LABOR ACTIVISTS. AND THE SOVIET UNION DID NOT LIKE THAT ONE BIT. IN THE END, THOUGH, THE SOVIET UNION DID NOT NEED TO INVADE POLAND. THE COMMUNIST POLISH GOVERNMENT DECLARED MARTIAL LAW AND STAGED ITS OWN MILITARY INVENTION. PROTESTS WERE BRUTALLY PUT DOWN. DEMONSTRATORS WERE KILLED. THOUSANDS OF OPPOSITION ACTIVISTS WERE IN PRISON. BUT THAT WAS NOT THE END OF THE STORY. ACTUALLY, IT WAS JUST THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY. BECAUSE THE SOLITARY MOVEMENT WAS NOT DESTROYED. IT OPERATED UNDERGROUND THROUGH YEARS OF REPRESSION, UNTIL IT BURST BACK INTO THE OPEN IN THE LATE 19 80S. AND IT FORCED THE GOVERNMENT INTO SOMETHING THAT HAD NEVER HAPPENED IN THE HISTORY OF COMMUNIST EASTERN EUROPE. FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS. >> THE UNTHINKABLE WAS HAPPENING BEFORE THEIR EYES. POLLS RELISHED EVERY -- RESULT. ADDED TO A CRUSHING DEFEAT OF THE -- MASTERS OF POLAND. THE COMMUNIST PARTY. >> IT IS ONE STEP IN OUR ESCAPE FROM SERVED, I'M FROM COMMUNISM. >> SOLIDARITY COMPUTED THAT IT IS CANDIDATES WE COMPLETELY CONTROL THE POLISH SENATE, AND WIN EVERY -- SEAT -- THE OTHER HOUSE IN POLAND'S -- WAY. >> WE ALL MUST PREVAIL POLAND. NO MATTER WHO -- >> WITH THEIR FIRST STEP TOWARDS DEMOCRACY'S DEFENSE SUCCESSFULLY TAKE, AND POLLS DESCENDED ON THE CHINESE EMBASSY TO PROTEST THE REPRESSION IN THAT COUNTRY. THEY HAD CONFRONTED THEIR COMMUNIST PARTY AT THE BALLOT BOX. AND NOT A SINGLE DROP OF BLOOD HAD BEEN SHED. >> THE FIRST DOMINO TO FALL IN THE COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET UNION FELL RIGHT HERE IN POLAND. THE LEADER OF SOLIDARITY, LIKE VALENCIA, BECAME POLAND'S FIRST DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED PRESIDENT.\",\n",
       " \"- No breakfast for us, it's not even 7 AM yet and the KFC is closed - We've started the road trip to Olszyna at 4 to reach the Motopark. There we'll fight in the ULTRA4 race  - Good morning! You guys came for the mushroom picking? - No, how do we get to Kazimierz? - How's the road? - 7 hours of just sitting around. - Yeah, 2 hours of sleep - I've seen the rain cloud you've dragged with you though. - No way, it was here already - Let's hurry before it rains down on the camp set up - I was just watching your video with the AK4 team from the last year's race and they were crying because of the dust - We'll struggle with the mud for a change - It's getting brighter though.. - You see the fields over there? The track stretches 10 km that way - And here up the trees, all of it is track   - How long? - A little shorter this year but around 12 km - A 12 km loop? - Something like that  - We'll have to test our car before we hit the race, maybe today or tomorrow morning - This is a new challenge for us in the Olsztyna Motopark, beautiful location. The track looks freshly dug up and redone  - So that's the difference, in the last ULTRA4 in France it was just rocks - Very tight and full of stones when here it seems to have a lot of mud because of the rain - Couple hops, longer strips, slides and climbs  - Probably lots of rocks hidden in between. I don't know about any forest tracks  - Much more diverse overall. Let's get it! - Time to move along - Ultra has strict safety rules but it's made for you - It's not even a thing to complain about. They take a huge responsibility with checking us. The things I saw in the more amateur races... It's a miracle there isn't more accidents and deaths - You have to know that dying during the even less official rallies in Poland happens  - The river that drowned car last year isn't a point this year - You may ask why, this is a endurance race after all but the formula wants you to reach the end and not kill the car at the start - You drive in the water up to the roof two times and you're out of it. People came here to watch the show as well   - That's why they excluded it, as little water as possible - This will be the hardest track for the 4400 and legends  - There is a small muddy dip right here from the race and  the wheel size matters  - Based on their classification they should go with the track even with the obstacles\",\n",
       " \"[Music] today we set off to the capital of the West pomorskie void ship stretchin founded in the 8th century by Slavic inhabitants the area that eventually became a great city at prime location with access to both the Oder River and the Baltic Sea to this day it's one of the most important harbours of the country due to stretchin strategic location the city has enjoyed a rich at a times turbulent history and this is illustrated by the many landmarks that tourists can enjoy as they explore the first of which is the Royal gate behind me now a legacy of the Prussians when they really [Music] built in the Middle Ages the old market is still the main square of the city formerly used as a wheat trading point nowadays has become one of the most touristic spots in the city with countless cafes and restaurants in the area stretchin is famous for its regional products some of them you might even notice and shops in your country for instance there is a distinctive fish spread called paprika stead schinsky made from fish tomatoes and various spices the old City Hall is located on shouldn´t and Market Square and was constructed back in the 16th century [Music] you although there are no moats or dungeons there is a very charming castle I'd like to invite you to see between the 14th and the 16th century a chapel stood right here all that remains today are the outlines of its foundation but it gives you an imagination for how important religion was at the heart of the castle in the 12th century this region was primarily of the pagan faith yet Christianity was on the rise famously a bishop came here to baptize the region but the first baptism did not take he had to return two years later to rebaptised everyone here we are in 2019 and Stetson is rather Catholic I think the second baptism probably stuck [Music] so we are light in the Renaissance castle of Iranian Dukes which is the historic seat of the Griffith dynasty when it started roughly in 13 14th century and it lasts until 17th century actually it's one of the long living dynasties in Europe but we don't know much about it because it's not that famous well the first one is called virtue suave and he was Prince virtue suave and there's also a legend with the Gryphon symbol with him because he sent a soldier to the place where they discovered this nest of the Gryphon and that's why they called the Griffin says of the diversion dynasty that's why you can also see this in the clock there are some Griffin's there and the clock has a gesture maybe you can look after and he strikes the bells like hearings hours and quarters but actually there is a funny scary legend about him because he was ducal jester here in the castle and when he decided to scare the Duke because he was sick he actually scared him very much and he might found out of him and this couldn't be because he was a Duke and he was just a gesture should so they actually tried to execute him but the execution was fake and it was done with a sausage so it's quite a great story well not so great because their jester died because he died out of fear he didn't know it was this he thought it was real execution here and so he died unfortunately because of this about more crazy and actually scary stories we can go to the witch's cell soon and I'll show you this Danya and tell him sorry about Cydonia phone book she was a witch here [Music] she was a noble woman living here in the region and she fell in love with one of the princess well the Dukes son and they couldn't get married because it was a Miss alliance because she was just a noblewoman and he was a Duke son and she really got upset because there was a promise made of the marriage and she allegedly cast a spell upon the Griffin dynasty and it said within 50 years the Griffin dynasty will be wiped out yeah and actually the curse started working so they figure out that donia might be a witch so they try to execute her and they actually did and by the way execution did not work they still died out after that [Music] one of the most important events leading to the demise of the Polish People's Republic were the strikes of August 1980 the strikes resulted in the August agreements which enabled the official registration of the Solidarity labor union said trade union later played an important role in overcoming the communist regime of Poland even though the actual agreements were mainly associated with Gdansk the first of them were actually signed here in Stetson in 1970 the People's Republic of Poland started to see some cracks in their system some disgruntled workers signs of uprising and they swiftly tried to contain the situation by committing murder atrocities in various Polish cities Stetson was no exception to that this monument illustrates the gravity of the people who were lost in December of 1970 what really strikes me is the youth that was involved from the range of age 20 to 18 16 years old these were essentially people at the beginning of their life who gave a lot so that we could live in freedom one of the most popular legends about attention is probably the one about hidden treasure it's been said that German Nazis built of a small town under the city to keep their stolen treasures the location of the hidden town remains a mystery but there are still plenty of people trying to discover its riches for the seafood lovers I have chosen one of the best restaurants in Ch tension it is here that you can get a wide assortment of seafood delivered fresh on a daily basis directly from Berlin in fact I've chosen tuna steaks but the menu is huge there's lobster mussels clams oysters salmon and so on let's check it out tuna is a really fun protein because it takes on flavor well and it doesn't need a lot of seasoning to be flavorful root full if you will metaphorically speaking so without the sauces I can tell you that it tastes a little bit Carla see there's a little bit of butter touch a salt a bit of pepper but it's perfect as a meat when you start to take the sauces on the flavor goes up a notch for sure and I actually could eat the fish as it is but this this is but this is ideal in my opinion for people who are not into fish and once almost disguised the flavor of it this is nice this is a pepper sauce and here we have the cream dill sauce and these sauces are ideal for people who might be a little bit squeamish about eating fish especially fish that is raw on the inside it helps to disguise the texture and the flavor I fortunately happen to love tuna seared so I don't need the sauce at all [Music] this Philharmonic's grand reception hall will leave you breathless not only that it is a functional space it doubles as a cinema and a concert hall with very very capable acoustics it's glorious this modern structure was built in 2014 and quickly became an architectural icon of the city the four floors of the Philharmonic are occupied not only by concert halls but also by art galleries a cafe a spacious Lobby and a foyer this Symphony Hall has provided an exceptional acoustic experience to countless music lovers the exterior facade of the building is unusually white resembling an iceberg [Music] what a fascinating concept the place that you come to witness art is in it of itself a piece of art yet it is highly functional and technological in fact those acoustic panels surrounding me adjust at the press of a button to accommodate the Preferences of the performer and many different performers have passed through here from jazz to symphonic to even electronic music [Music] we now find ourselves in this small gallery and it's a precious little space but it has one oddity in contrast to the rest of this facility a window see the Philharmonic inch section only features three windows so you have to enjoy the rarity while you can [Music] st. James Cathedral is one of the tallest in Poland and it was built between the 12th and 15th century after World War two it was badly damaged it actually sat in ruins until the 1970s believe it or not today as you can see they're still doing reconstruction work but it offers a fantastic view for the end of this episode that chin has caused me to slightly recalibrate my expectations and imagination for what Polish city is visually speaking and considering its great distance from other major cities you kind of feel as if you're on an island I enjoyed myself greatly hope to come back here and I hope that you will do the same and until then I'm Ryan so cash for London [Music]\",\n",
       " \"if you had to say something about Poland it\\xa0\\nwould be probably either vodka stealing cars or\\xa0\\xa0 getting invaded so today I'll dive into why Poland\\xa0\\nkeeps getting invaded examining the geographical\\xa0\\xa0 political and cultural reasons including examples\\xa0\\nand explanations hey Slavic Vikings and welcome to\\xa0\\xa0 another video about Poland I have lived in Poland\\xa0\\nfor 13 years and you can feel the cultural impact\\xa0\\xa0 of all the past suffering inflicted on This Nation\\xa0\\nthere is a deep resentment in the Polish mentality\\xa0\\xa0 I talk more about this in a video in the corner\\xa0\\nnow Poland was founded in 966 by mishko the first\\xa0\\xa0 it was getting invaded before it even existed\\xa0\\nfor example Otto the first in 963. since then\\xa0\\xa0 Poland has been going through constant Wars almost\\xa0\\nevery year for hundreds of years during the Middle\\xa0\\xa0 Ages Poland wanted to incorporate other fellow\\xa0\\nWest Slavic peoples under the rule of Polish\\xa0\\xa0 Dukes such as the earlier mentioned mieshko the\\xa0\\nfirst and then defend the lands acquired in the\\xa0\\xa0 west from the Holy Roman Empire for much of its\\xa0\\nearly history as a Christian State Poland had to\\xa0\\xa0 contend with Pomeranians prussians lithuanians and\\xa0\\nother Baltic peoples in a continuous Border Wars\\xa0\\xa0 without clear results or end inside however after\\xa0\\ntheir Teutonic order conquered and assimilated\\xa0\\xa0 depressions it began incursions into polish and\\xa0\\nLithuanian territories this represented a far\\xa0\\xa0 greater threat to both Poland and Lithuania and\\xa0\\nthe two countries United in a defensive Alliance\\xa0\\xa0 the 17th century saw Fierce rivalry between the\\xa0\\nthen major Eastern European powers Sweden the\\xa0\\xa0 Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Ottoman\\xa0\\nEmpire at its peak the Commonwealth compromised\\xa0\\xa0 the territories of present-day Poland and large\\xa0\\nparts of Ukraine Belarus Lithuania Latvia Estonia\\xa0\\xa0 and Russia and represented a major European power\\xa0\\nhowever because of bad political policy liberun\\xa0\\xa0 veto by the end of the 18th century a series of\\xa0\\ninternal conflicts and wars with foreign enemies\\xa0\\xa0 led to the dissolution of the Polish Lithuanian\\xa0\\nCommonwealth and this slow partitioning of Poland\\xa0\\xa0 making Poland completely disappear from the\\xa0\\nmap for the first time in my opinion liberun\\xa0\\xa0 veto had a considerable impact on the first three\\xa0\\npartitions of Poland and it's a good example of\\xa0\\xa0 political reasons for its collapse liberun veto in\\xa0\\na nutshell is where a member of The Government Can\\xa0\\xa0 overthrow any new potential ruling by declaring\\xa0\\nthe law this law was in use technically for\\xa0\\xa0 hundreds of years but only towards the end of the\\xa0\\nCommonwealth they did become a problem because\\xa0\\xa0 of Corruption of members getting bribes from\\xa0\\nother country diplomats and group in fighting\\xa0\\xa0 pose unsuccessfully struggled to win back their\\xa0\\nindependence throughout the 19th century at first\\xa0\\xa0 they put their hopes into Napoleon later they\\xa0\\ntried to ignite National uprisings every now\\xa0\\xa0 and then most of them bloodly repressed in the\\xa0\\nturmoil of the first world war polls regained\\xa0\\xa0 independence and expanded their territories\\xa0\\nin a series of local Wars and uprisings they\\xa0\\xa0 even managed to push the Soviets Union quite\\xa0\\nfar the Polish Independence was not for long\\xa0\\xa0 since just a few years later the German Nazis\\xa0\\nand Soviet Russians invaded Poland once again\\xa0\\xa0 making Poland disappear from them up after the\\xa0\\nAxis powers lost Poland technically regained its\\xa0\\xa0 independence as a communist Russian puppet state\\xa0\\nbut many posts don't see their independence until\\xa0\\xa0 the last Russian troops left polish soil in\\xa0\\n1993. the first and most obvious reason Poland\\xa0\\xa0 is so attractive for foreign invasion is its\\xa0\\ngeography other than the Carpathian Mountains\\xa0\\xa0 in the South and historical small Coastline in\\xa0\\nthe north the entirety of Poland is located in\\xa0\\xa0 the great European Plain and most of its borders\\xa0\\nweren't even set on Rivers only the newest borders\\xa0\\xa0 after World War II uses Rivers as borders most of\\xa0\\nthe Polish landscape is flat fields which are the\\xa0\\xa0 perfect environment for Invasion Russia may have\\xa0\\nsimilar geography but they can infinitely Retreat\\xa0\\xa0 which Poland can't do another big reasons\\xa0\\nthat are less covered are political reasons\\xa0\\xa0 Poland historically likes to be non-aligned\\xa0\\nor Ally itself with Far Away Western powers\\xa0\\xa0 that don't end up helping Poland when they need it\\xa0\\nthe first example is Poland trusting Napoleon with\\xa0\\xa0 the liberation of Poland the second is Poland\\xa0\\nputting their faith in the allies during World\\xa0\\xa0 War II right now Poland is basically trusting\\xa0\\nthe U.S to defend it in potential Invasion so\\xa0\\xa0 let's hope that the third times the charm and\\xa0\\nPoland won't get abandoned this time although it\\xa0\\xa0 did not seem like Poland was gonna get left by the\\xa0\\nU.S when Ukrainian missiles recently hit polished\\xa0\\xa0 soil thinking it was the Russians polish culture\\xa0\\nalso does not help to prevent Poland from getting\\xa0\\xa0 invaded there is a big difference between being\\xa0\\nneutral and non-aligned the Way Poland is and was\\xa0\\xa0 not aligned is that they don't like aligning with\\xa0\\nother bordering Powers but they won't Prevail from\\xa0\\xa0 using a situation to their advantage by invading\\xa0\\na country in trouble so for those reasons Poland\\xa0\\xa0 has gone through a lot of suffering but how did\\xa0\\nthis impact fall in I covered how it impacted the\\xa0\\xa0 Polish mentality but it has also impacted Poland\\xa0\\nin a more visible way because so many big Wars\\xa0\\xa0 have been on polish land polish infrastructure\\xa0\\nand Industry have suffered a lot all the battles\\xa0\\xa0 are a primary reason why Germany is so much richer\\xa0\\nthan Poland Germany has easier borders to defend\\xa0\\xa0 Poland during World War II has a choice to make\\xa0\\nthey knew they had no chance against the Germans\\xa0\\xa0 but they fought them to the very end anyway\\xa0\\nexploding factories and any industry the Germans\\xa0\\xa0 could use after they capitulated polish chose\\xa0\\nculture over economic prosperity France after\\xa0\\xa0 seeing the extreme

       " \"are you renting a flood in poland or maybe you are about to sign an agreement today i will tell you about a very important and quite difficult thing the real estate and rental laws in poland what are the obligation of the landlord and the tenant what official rules you have to follow and how to protect yourselves stay with me and you will know all the answers [Music] law is tough thing i know the official language raised a lot of doubts and questions but here comes our explanation in the easiest possible way with our guide you will finally understand it let's start with the most important thing from your perspective as a tenant duties of landlord and the tenant of course both ladders and tenants have their responsibilities it's good to know what you can demand but also what rules you have to follow let's go for the most important ones maintenance and repairs according to polish law the landlord is responsible for all the mechanicals and appliances in the building and in the apartment that allows you to use things like electricity water heating elevator gas but what does it exactly mean in other easier words he takes care of the maintenance of central heating plumbing electrical installation he is doing all the necessary repairs and the costs are on his side before you move in the landlord is responsible to check the apartment and make all the repairs of course things wear out over time and the lander has to prepare the flat for the next tenant as i mentioned in a previous video you cannot be charged for the regular wear and tear but the term regular wear and turn must be clarified if the pot is burnt the pan is squashed so the teflon is off or the couch is so dirty that it cannot be clean it's not a regular wear and tear the lander has the full right to charge you for the replacement i know that the dirty couch can still be used but put yourself in the place of a new tenant would you really like to rent a flat with a dirty couch not to mention that the burned pot is dangerous for your health let's give more examples if the heating system stops working the ladder has to come and fix it and costs are on his side also if the fridge or oven stops working because it's old the lantern has to replace it and the costs are also on his side if the flooring in your apartment breaks just because it's low quality is not your fault but if you drop something and make a hole you have to pay for the reaper what about the building its surroundings and the staircase all owners of the apartment in the building creates a whole owner's association called spunota mieshkanyova your landlord is part of it and has some influence on that but he cannot repair anything on its own in the building right away for example if the salvage system in the building is clogged the homeowner association has to organize plumbers and pays for the repairs your lander should inform you right away about the problem but he cannot fix it on his own here same as in the apartment if you damage something in the building or staircase you have to pay for the repairs so remember you are responsible not only for your apartment but the building as well changes in the apartment interior design what about changing anything in the apartment well be prudent and upgrade ulef in polish can only be done with the written permission of the android well not everything is an upgrade for example if you are changing a painting in a frame or hanging blinds just keep the original ones it's not an upgrade as it doesn't increase the value of the flat and it's easy to remove however if you plan to do something bigger like painting walls or hanging a shelf as you make holes in a wall you must have a written permission of the language according to polish law after ending the lease flat must be in the same condition as at the beginning well it's easy to say but how to do this first of all be consistent clean the flood regularly and maintain it in a good condition for carpets furniture etc if something breaks let your laundry know right away the kettle won't magically repair itself and at the beginning it can be easier and cheaper to repair before the damage gets worse when you know the move out date prepare the flat of course you have to take all your belongings but also throw out trash clean cabinets furniture toilet and everything else not only on the outside but also on the inside don't forget to clean the windows if you don't do it properly your ladder can ask you to pay for an extra cleaning service if during the lease you replaced or repaired something you have the right to get the refund but only in case you have the written permission of the landlord if you replace something without his knowledge he doesn't have to keep things you bought and you have to take them when moving out so please always ask the landlord first now let's talk about very important issue which is rental pricing trees can the android change the rental price during the rental time the answer is yes but he has to inform you in written form no longer than on the last day of the month you have the right to keep the rental increase notice the provisional staff key change it's not the same as the rental termination notice the termination notice is usually three months or it can be longer if the list says so then you have two months to let him know if you don't agree to the increase you have to move out for example if the rental increase is announced from the 1st of february your rental increase notice is calculated from the 1st of november till the 31st of january full 3 months the lender has to provide you with determined rental increase notice by the end of october by the end of december you have to let the landlord know that you don't agree for the increase then by the end of january you have to move out the another has arrived to increase the rental price maximum once every six month but please remember that it only applies to the rental price not the advanced monthly payment for the utilities if the city increased the charge of the waste disposal three times a year the lender has right to increase it too important in poland paper is a must well you don't need the written correspondence with your landlord it can be done via email but when it comes to important documents like ending the contract or signing an annex it must be done on paper with your hand-written signature by your hand no copy and paste or created in a computer program signature is not valid early contract termination is it even possible both the landers and the tenant have a right to end the contract earlier but under a certain conditions as i said in the previous video before you sign the lease as your lender if it's possible to end the contract earlier in general according to polish law the lease with a termination date cannot be entered before its date you can do it if you have a contract without a stated termination date in this case you can end the contract with a three months termination notice but be careful your lender can end the contract earlier if you are not paying the rent you don't in the apartment and in general you don't care about it you sublease the apartment you party a lot and your neighbors complain the building you live in needs to be torn down or renovated i know these are some extreme situation but i want you to know insurance insurance is a very important thing that we usually don't think about but it's good to have it of course your landlord will or at least should have some thanks to that you are protected from unexpected events like a broken washing machine in your neighbor's flat that floats your apartment however you can also ensure yourself from the damage that you caused or something unexpected happen for example breaking a glass door shower or a theft the insurance is called civil liability insurance and it's relatively cheap compared to the damage that you can make highly recommended not a react your landlord can ask you to sign an agreement in the form of notary act and there is nothing to be afraid about i know that you're an honest and responsible person so don't stress when the lender suggests signing and not react usually he is the one who prepares everything he will set up a date find the translator and probably he will pay for that i will only tell you that we have two types of notary act occasionally when you as a tenant sign a contract with a private person and institutional lease when your landlord is a company here are some other useful pieces of information the lander cannot enter the apartment without your permission during the lease however the lisa agreement can indicate the periodical inspections in your presence exception in the urgent and dangerous case the ladder can enter your apartment without your permission or presence but only with the policeman as a foreigner you may not want to pay in polish zloty you can ask another if it's possible to pay in different currency like euros or u.s dollars a private owner should may not give you such a possibility but the company should have if you need some more help you can always ask the rental agency but remember it's connected with the commission fee it is usually a month friend plus 23 of tax but remember not all the companies are rental agencies some of them owns the apartments so we don't pay for the commission fee if you are not sure if the person renting the apartment is entitled to do so you can always check it in your land and

       " \"It's great having Amazon's hub close to our facilities,  with products from all over Europe, ready and packed for when we need them. KTW1 Humanitarian Hub in Poland I've been at Amazon since forever. What we're doing now is really special. The area we are currently in is dedicated for our support for Save the Children. It spans 3,500 sq. m. and can store as many as 1,500 pallets. This gives a total of over a million products This is the first shipment for Save The Children organization. This is an especially important shipment  as it's the very first one in the history of our partnership as an international hub supporting humanitarian foundations. We are now in Zabierzów where Amazon's first shipment of goods for Save the Children is being unloaded to help our friends from Ukraine. I'm happy to be here as part of my job, to be able to help. Thanks to Amazon and a collaboration between the local government and Eximius Park we're able to provide supplies and goods for Ukrainian children and their families.\",\n",

       " \"Hello friends today we talk about very important subject from my point of view what is the most than euro thing in Poland I am from another country so many things in Po in Poland people think it's europeo for me it's very very Weir and the UN Euro weed what country you from China China Asian country the culture are so different so I have a lot of culture shock I'm going to tell you this today and since today's video is a talking video we have to prepare some drink yeah leer okay I'm prepared today all right like French people they bring their wine everywhere and German people take their people a beer everywhere Polish people take vertica everywhere this is not Li we don't have vka we take liquor everywhere so this is a caramel taste lior right and it's a gift from our friends usually we don't drink aloh at home and it's interesting to try polish Le because they have different tast let's try this [Music] first it's quite good nice okay so let's start our first first point what is the very unur in Poland I think Polish people are are not afraid of coldness they don't feel what did I say ah so let's start talk about are you drunk Polish people we soow little to clothes you know I observe that through the whole year except for the hottest days I always wear two times three times more cloth more clothes than Polish people in the street like 10° I still see people walking with a sh so I I always wear a lot of clothes and at the same time my husband this one he he always say so hot so hot thinking oh my God what's wrong with him and and especially in the night my feet are so cold and I have to hug him to steal heat from him but he's like a like a heat ball is always and me it heat so it's good that we have something I don't need any I don't need the hot water what what is it called that you know you can put the hot water inside this thing and hold this the kindest people like it so so in other words your shock is that I'm hot you and many other people you didn't try other people do I have to try I can see that they when I'm shaking in the coldness they don't feel anything okay they have a very thin blouse and and short [Music] t-shirt so let's talk about the second thing so second thing for me I think it's weird to see at films movies from from another country at the Polish people will make it lectors they call it the lect so it's like the movie are in original sound but there is a person a man a male voice reading the Polish subtitle there are no subtit without emotion that's very weird very weird for me like I cannot get used to this so it's not a dabbing there is original sound yes original dialoges yeah can hear them in language but besides of this there is a Polish lecto talking in Polish there are no subtitles in Polish yeah sometimes they are writing so so I don't I don't know what Polish people listen listen to the people who are talking or people listen to the movie they listen to know to polish Lector so it's really really weird I never heard of this before I came to Poland okay okay next one next one is that no the Polish post shop they say all different kinds of small things books souvenirs toys and children toys Children books it's hard to recognize which one is the major business for me not it's not it's not it's like a shop it's not hard to recognize anymore these are shops literally right now they also soap and shampoo and I don't know all type of nonsense umbrellas they are shops and by the way still sometimes you can send a letter there that's really weird because you know everything's so colorful and where I'm going to send my letter what I'm going to what am I doing there a magic word for children well I believe that children will be very happy to go there and it's like a Chinese shop the Chinese shop is also interesting in Poland we see everywhere there are Chinese shop and and before I enter one I imagine that I can find a lot of Chinese or Asian food or ingredients there spices whatever but they have nothing they have nothing related to food they sell clothes or small items tools and many other things but there's no food this is very we for me you know yeah in China there is a city very famous it's called e they produce trippy the all those small items I I think that this Chinese shop is just a copy of the city it's so interesting yeah so I don't know how important this Chinese shop is to p polish people's everyday life I've never been there in my entire life and other Polish people do you you really buy things there I have no idea but there are so many of these shops that I don't know they have to sell something right another shop I hope they are Che okay the next one next one I forgot I have to think about it next thing is that Polish people celebrate their name day they have a calendar of the names and which day they could celebrate it's like a birthday but more important than the birthday right many people don't celebrate birthday but they celebrate name day yeah so I can but my name is not on the calendar so I cannot celebrate my name day another very unur thing for me that maybe it's it's um more about a person or it but I have to say many Polish people think it's very polite to take over shoes if you visit somebody's home you go to other people home and they take all their shoes so let me ask you you go there and the host provide you a slipper will you will you wear the slipper I this is a problem of hyg personal Hy so so what people do in China in this situation wait wait wait I have to finish this so so if the person provide so if the house provide you a slipper and you think I don't want to wear the slipper that other people wear in this case you have to walk with your bare foot on the floor or you have a socks yeah but same I I feel like if there's no shoes like I'm walking with a bare food so on one hand it's very cold on the other hand if the host the same work without show then it's okay but if they have a showe at home but I have to work without a show it's very weird I feel like I am what walking cleaning clothes that wherever I go I clean there it's really really weird yeah it would not happen usually oh yeah it doesn't fit for all the people because the GU the guys they can always take their own you know sleepers when they go to visit somebody yeah you do like this yes why not well maybe it's for closer people if you take your shes to more you know decent colleague does it look [Music] weird no not so much oh in China people noway people really don't care too much where that you wear your showes in their home if they can they will provide you a plastic in this this what what is the name of this in English plastic BS protection yeah protection plastic protection for your shoes yeah just a simple one pretty one you wear once and you throw it away kind show so you can protect and at the same time sleep parade you can use that or in closa family they'll provide you a king sleeper sleeper and usually for example like my uncle each time the gas went away they will clean the sleeper sleeper yes they will do it that's not so bad so mostly if if we want our guest take off shows then it's it's for closer people like family member so like a normal friends and we will not ask people to take our shoes Okay okay so I think that's it's already Five Points that it's very weird for me in Poland how do you think about it should see okay leave your comment below and then watch our videos and subscribe byebye you have to finish it [Music] not\",\n",
       " \"exactly I am currently in the main market square it's about zero degrees but it's really nice and festive so I invite you to join me on this adventure and I'm gonna go ahead and show you guys what's going on over there [Music] [Music] [Music] and today we are in Krakow Poland if you don't know I am half polish and half American and throughout this holiday I am gonna be documenting the holiday experience it's about 12 p.m. right now which in Poland it always feels like it's around 4 at this time when you get up it's like oh is this day ending it's not it's just the magic of this country and today I am going to be walking around the city of Krakow I'm currently at a yata Mata ki jai automatic at a Christmas Street Market so I'm gonna show you what what my city has to offer it's not much but it's nice ok so the main reason why I am at a Christmas market is [Music] if you follow me you probably happen to know already that I'm vegan so you're probably like why are you excited all there is here is probably cheese and meat well guess what there's three of us we're trying to figure out what goes Jiki are called I'm gonna like write it on the screen so you guys can see you later what it's called really aromatic and I think this will heat me up I think I need a even if you're not polish I'm sure you've heard a few times someone say that in Poland we have the best bread and it's hard not to agree with that and Jim yucky yucky so I forgot to exchange sweaty so I'm paying in Euros luckily they're taking it all right so I just got the most expensive Jim yaki of my life but regardless I'm really happy I also got some mochi and ketchup these are the best a cookie that I've had in over a year I think they're amazing [Music] backflip Lucas took me to see this Christmas tree and it looks kiddin five years ago exactly in this place when I was 16 I started my first business which was a lemonade stand now you remember so yeah I didn't get any allowance and so I decided I'm gonna take everything into my own hand and that's how it all started and look where I'm at right now this place the bhava yeah I had to pay about a couple hundred sweat ease of fiims to stand there yeah it was not a legal business [Music] so this is what happens when you move out of your country you can come a tourist in your own city krakow is known to be the european capital of culture it is one of the most unique destinations in the world it is the second largest and one of the oldest cities in poland situated on the vasila river it is one of the leading centres of Polish academic culture and artistic life the number of people living in the city is 760 thousand there are exactly a hundred and thirty-five churches and the main Market Square is the biggest in all of Europe the city has developed over many centuries setting for many historic styles of architecture including Gothic Renaissance and Beryl and one of the most perfect examples is the Babel Cathedral and Castle [Music] the bubble castle is one of the most beautiful and monumental castles in all of Europe it's definitely the most known one in Poland and the cathedral is one of the most sacred places in the country it holds the tunes of Polish kings national heroes and Generals the surface of the castle is exactly seven thousand and forty square meters which includes 71 exhibition rooms now it is a museum but for many centuries it was the residence of multiple kings and queens the bubble hill is also known to be one of the 7 biggest chakram in the world it is a taboo topic since Poland is a very Catholic country but many believe that it is a place where you can recharge your batteries by observing good energy and positive radiation Cappadocia fretless Adama yeah I got a sesame pretzel it's a traditional it's a traditional polish snack if you're downtown you know also other popular ones are the ones with salt and with poppy seeds and you can also get them with cheese yeah all right so I just got a cloaca which is actually directly translated into the word cow anyways it has nothing to do with cows it's just like caramel candy I think it froze cuz I can't bite it I love straight-up sugar it's kind of like a jawbreaker it's so chewy so I see there's lots and lots of pottery Krakow is a very artistic city so this isn't anything unusual [Music]\",\n",
       " \"what's up guys welcome to beautiful warsaw\\xa0\\nthe capital of poland we started our day off\\xa0\\xa0 just the right way with some mexican food\\xa0\\nin a place called Bar Pacyfik and they\\xa0\\xa0 had the funkiest toilet that we have ever seen\\xa0\\nit was like a trippy experience the tacos were\\xa0\\xa0 absolutely delicious as well but let's go and\\xa0\\nexplore the capital city of poland warsaw\\xa0\\xa0 and we're going to take you this is going to be\\xa0\\na bit of a raw video no cuts or edits or anything\\xa0\\xa0 like that just a few clips that you would have had\\xa0\\nwould have seen there layered over the top of this\\xa0\\xa0 quick intro but right now we are in łazienki park\\xa0\\nwhich was a park that came highly recommended to\\xa0\\xa0 us you guys wrote it down in the comment section\\xa0\\nand said go and check out the park there's a\\xa0\\xa0 castle actually directly here behind me as\\xa0\\nwell this park is very beautiful very grand\\xa0\\xa0 and very opulent and large but yeah we're going\\xa0\\nto take you on a quick walk through the streets\\xa0\\xa0 of warsaw and i hope you guys enjoy this as\\xa0\\ni said no cuts no edits anything like that\\xa0\\xa0 the breakfast that we had there as well i'm gonna\\xa0\\nturn you around so that you can just see what we\\xa0\\xa0 see the mexican tacos that we had they were\\xa0\\nsurprisingly um very close to the mexican food\\xa0\\xa0 that you would get in mexico itself like i\\xa0\\ndidn't think that that would be the\\xa0\\xa0 case because usually when you get mexican food\\xa0\\nor chinese food or something like that outside\\xa0\\xa0 of the actual country usually it's not that\\xa0\\ngood but these ones were really good right they\\xa0\\xa0 were amazing yeah they were actually as naomi\\xa0\\nsaid very close to the ones that we had we had\\xa0\\xa0 an unbelievable amount of mexican street food\\xa0\\nwhile we were in mexico if you haven't checked\\xa0\\xa0 out our mexico playlist we spent like four months\\xa0\\ntraveling through mexico on public transport\\xa0\\xa0 so we have some pretty interesting videos over\\xa0\\nthere and we had some pretty crazy food there\\xa0\\xa0 as well and that was actually the closest that\\xa0\\nwe've had in terms of authentic mexican food and\\xa0\\xa0 we had it here in warsaw of all places so that's\\xa0\\nreally surprising who would have thought yeah\\xa0\\xa0 but the whole point of this video guys is that\\xa0\\nwe're gonna bring you on a walk with us through\\xa0\\xa0 warsaw we're gonna talk as well just a little\\xa0\\nbit about you know we've been in poland now two\\xa0\\xa0 two and a half months nearly three nearly three\\xa0\\nmonths three i believe yeah and this warsaw is\\xa0\\xa0 our 15th city in poland 15th and final city that\\xa0\\nwe are checking out and this is really our second\\xa0\\xa0 day wandering around the city and checking it out\\xa0\\nit does look like it might rain um what i wanted\\xa0\\xa0 to say i got a notification saying that it's\\xa0\\nsupposed to rain at one so now it's twenty past\\xa0\\xa0 one pray for us that the weather stays just like\\xa0\\nthis without rain yeah we should be okay but\\xa0\\xa0 you guys have been recommending so much different\\xa0\\nthings down in our comments and we are so\\xa0\\xa0 so grateful for that thanks to you guys we are\\xa0\\nable to see all of this sort of hidden stuff that\\xa0\\xa0 not a lot of tourists get to see i believe the\\xa0\\nbar Pacyfik where we had breakfast breakfast today\\xa0\\xa0 um was a recommendation off of one of you guys\\xa0\\nas well right yeah yeah one of our subscribers\\xa0\\xa0 jumped into our comment section on instagram if\\xa0\\nyou guys aren't following us over on instagram\\xa0\\xa0 make sure and do that it's just at two mad\\xa0\\nexplorers so at two mad explorers i nearly fell\\xa0\\xa0 there yeah make sure to follow us on instagram\\xa0\\nyou get to see kind of all of the behind the\\xa0\\xa0 scenes stuff we always put up instagram stories\\xa0\\nwhere we share what we're doing on a daily basis\\xa0\\xa0 so we share the food that we have we share the\\xa0\\ndifferent museums that we go to and check out\\xa0\\xa0 travel days all that type of stuff so it's\\xa0\\ndefinitely worth checking out our instagram a\\xa0\\xa0 little bit of a social media plug right there\\xa0\\nbut right now we're just coming out of\\xa0\\xa0 łazienki park and it's in the ujazdów area of warsaw\\xa0\\napparently i hope i'm pronouncing that right\\xa0\\xa0 probably not speaking of pronunciations\\xa0\\nwe do have a pronunciation video in the works\\xa0\\xa0 so we put up a community post on our youtube\\xa0\\nas well so go over and check out that community\\xa0\\xa0 post because we're asking you guys to give us\\xa0\\nsome polish words that we have to pronounce and\\xa0\\xa0 we're going to do like an entire video just\\xa0\\nbasically pronouncing the hardest possible\\xa0\\xa0 polish words that we can let's see if we learned\\xa0\\nanything during our three months in poland i guess\\xa0\\xa0 probably not yeah we're gonna we're gonna be put\\xa0\\nto the test that's that's for sure hopefully\\xa0\\xa0 we have learned something because as we said\\xa0\\nwe've been here now for almost three months\\xa0\\xa0 straight without any breaks in between and\\xa0\\nwe have spoken to plenty of polish people\\xa0\\xa0 we've met plenty of locals we've made plenty of\\xa0\\nnew friends as well thanks to you guys and yeah\\xa0\\xa0 that's another reason why we're filming this video\\xa0\\nis because we want to talk a little bit about\\xa0\\xa0 our experience in poland as foreign\\xa0\\ntourists because a lot of times\\xa0\\xa0 you get youtube videos that just show the\\xa0\\nhighlights or just show the glamorous side\\xa0\\xa0 of stuff so we want to do this video just to\\xa0\\nkind of give you guys a little bit more of like a\\xa0\\xa0 relatable chat basically and you\\xa0\\nguys can obviously comment down below\\xa0\\xa0 as this video is going along and let us know\\xa0\\nwhat you think but for us as foreign tourists\\xa0\\xa0 visiting poland in summer 2022 it's been a really\\xa0\\ngreat experience we've learned so many different\\xa0\\xa0 things about polish history we have discovered\\xa0\\nso many different things about this country\\xa0\\xa0 that we never really thought about\\xa0\\nor never even really considered\\xa0\\xa0 and all in all it's been probably one of the best\\xa0\\neducational experiences that we could have gotten\\xa0\\xa0 right now we're currently waiting to cross\\xa0\\nthe street this is actually something that's\\xa0\\xa0 a little bit of a culture thing for me i'm irish\\xa0\\nin ireland there's no such thing as jaywalking\\xa0\\xa0 or you know in ireland you can cross the street\\xa0\\nwherever you want it doesn't matter if there's a\\xa0\\xa0 red light a green light orange light whatever and\\xa0\\nthere's nothing like that in terms of law you can\\xa0\\xa0 just cross when you want so i find often times we\\xa0\\nwill be crossing the street and i will go to cross\\xa0\\xa0 and naomi literally will have to grab me pull\\xa0\\nme back and be like the light's red the light's\\xa0\\xa0 red and i'll be like oh and i completely forget\\xa0\\nabout it but yeah there you go it's a little bit\\xa0\\xa0 of a culture shock for me i'm still getting\\xa0\\nused to it yeah for me not so much because\\xa0\\xa0 i grew up in germany so for me it's kind of normal\\xa0\\nthat you have to stop at a red light but when i\\xa0\\xa0 moved to ireland that was my culture shock because\\xa0\\ni realized that you don't have to wait for a red\\xa0\\xa0 light or for a green light or whatever you would\\xa0\\ncall it reverse filter yeah kind of a reverse\\xa0\\xa0 culture shock if you will but yeah three months\\xa0\\nin poland first of all i really want to thank all\\xa0\\xa0 of you guys for supporting us so much we are\\xa0\\nreally like highly appreciative of that because\\xa0\\xa0 i think obviously we have been traveling for quite\\xa0\\nsome time but i think we have never received that\\xa0\\xa0 much support as we did here in poland right\\xa0\\nyeah it's been it's actually been astounding\\xa0\\xa0 when you think about it we literally tripled i\\xa0\\nthink we tripled our channel size since we came\\xa0\\xa0 to poland so we're so grateful for every single\\xa0\\none of you guys that showed us support polish\\xa0\\xa0 people are some of the best people in the world\\xa0\\nwe genuinely mean that and the support has just\\xa0\\xa0 been truly outstanding and it almost makes us a\\xa0\\nlittle bit emotional as well just talking about it\\xa0\\xa0 because we set out on this trip of ours to travel\\xa0\\nfull-time roughly around a year and a half ago and\\xa0\\xa0 to be honest when we started it off you're full\\xa0\\nof self-doubt and you don't know whether or not\\xa0\\xa0 it's going to actually work or that you're\\xa0\\ngoing to actually be somewhat successful\\xa0\\xa0 and we just recently crossed over seven and a half\\xa0\\nseven point five thousand subscribers which wow\\xa0\\xa0 it's like that's like a little army it's like we\\xa0\\ncould literally go and start invite we could go\\xa0\\xa0 and start invading countries with our subscribers\\xa0\\nthe explorer army yeah how cool is that like\\xa0\\xa0 seven we're not going to invade anything though no no\\xa0\\nwe're good we're good but we are literally if you\\xa0\\xa0 think about it seven and a half thousand people\\xa0\\nstanding in front of you that's like that's like\\xa0\\xa0 a concert it's like a decent sized concert of\\xa0\\npeople that are like-minded and are interested\\xa0\\xa0 in travel so yeah we're so incredibly grateful for\\xa0\\nthat support and we are literally just going on a\\xa0\\xa0 kind of a tangent and wandering around warsaw here\\xa0\\nmaybe some of you guys will know what this street\\xa0\\xa0 is but this is the area that we're currently\\xa0\\nin we're kind of making our way towards\\xa0\\xa0 the palace of culture and science which we\\xa0\\nshowed in the video before this one we will\\xa0\\xa0 have a warsaw video out shortly before this one so\\xa0\\nmake sure to check that one out what i find really\\xa0\\xa0 surprising about warsaw because usually when you\\xa0\\nwalk around warsaw it's always like very crowded\\xa0\\xa0 there's always loads and loads of people because\\xa0\\nobviously there's loads of people living here\\xa0\\xa0 but this saturday for whatever reason it kind\\xa0\\nof feels like everybody is still asleep it's\\xa0\\xa0 kind it's midday now and you see some people but\\xa0\\nyou don't see nearly as many people as you would\\xa0\\xa0 on the other days so i think warsaw\\xa0\\nis still asleep today yeah for sure\\xa0\\xa0 we seem to be like there's very little people\\xa0\\nas you guys can see it's relatively relaxed and\\xa0\\xa0 we are pretty much central in terms of where\\xa0\\nwe're staying we're staying as well in a place\\xa0\\xa0 that is essentially a capsule hotel the room that\\xa0\\nwe have is absolutely insane it's literally just a\\xa0\\xa0 bed next to two walls and we actually speaking of\\xa0\\ninstagram put up a picture showing that we could\\xa0\\xa0 not even fit a remote control of a tv between\\xa0\\nthe wall and the bed and that's that's just\\xa0\\xa0 how small the room was but nonetheless it is\\xa0\\na very comfortable experience because there's\\xa0\\xa0 no window on the wall so it's just pitch black\\xa0\\nand kind of became like a little bit of a sleep\\xa0\\xa0 fortress for us yeah i thought it was a really\\xa0\\ngreat experience because it's very different\\xa0\\xa0 to what we would usually do you know usually\\xa0\\nwe would stay in airbnbs or maybe hostels or\\xa0\\xa0 hotel rooms if they are relatively cheap and kind\\xa0\\nof fit our budget so it was really good to see\\xa0\\xa0 a capsule hotel or a small room hotel basically\\xa0\\nyeah for sure but warsaw itself the city itself\\xa0\\xa0 is very surprising for us and to be honest me\\xa0\\npersonally i never had any sort of expectations\\xa0\\xa0 when it came to warsaw it was always a city that\\xa0\\nwas on my list it was always somewhere that i\\xa0\\xa0 wanted to eventually travel to but i never did i\\xa0\\nnever really found the the time to go and travel\\xa0\\xa0 to warsaw obviously until now and to be honest\\xa0\\nwe're both very very very grateful that we did\\xa0\\xa0 because for me personally i'm not sure about\\xa0\\nnaomi but for me personally it's definitely in\\xa0\\xa0 like my top three places and i've only been here\\xa0\\nthis is the second full day and i can already say\\xa0\\xa0 that this city is a gem and there's so many\\xa0\\ndifferent there's so much sort of i see so\\xa0\\xa0 much opportunity in this city it's massive size\\xa0\\nwise there's plenty going on so it's already has\\xa0\\xa0 shown that it's capable of being a great city\\xa0\\nbut we did hear quite a lot of polish people\\xa0\\xa0 quite a lot of comments and from polish people\\xa0\\nthat we know that said it's kind of boring there's\\xa0\\xa0 not much to see or do for tourists but to be\\xa0\\nhonest i think it's pretty cool i'm very very\\xa0\\xa0 positively surprised by warsaw as well because it\\xa0\\nis such a massive city but i feel like it's very\\xa0\\xa0 like it changes a lot like usually you know\\xa0\\nthe way for example when you look at berlin\\xa0\\xa0 just as an example or maybe even dusseldorf\\xa0\\nwhere i'm from um you would see kind of just one\\xa0\\xa0 type of architecture and the entire city kind\\xa0\\nof looks the same and i kind of feel like with\\xa0\\xa0 warsaw you have these like very very modern\\xa0\\naspects of the city but at the same time you\\xa0\\xa0 have loads and loads of old architecture and old\\xa0\\nbuildings that are really really cool to look at\\xa0\\xa0 and just those two kind of aspects merge together\\xa0\\ninto one city i think it's very incredible to see\\xa0\\xa0 and that warsaw actually managed to make that\\xa0\\nwork as well without looking kind of out of\\xa0\\xa0 place or maybe weird in a way and i feel like\\xa0\\nwarsaw really really managed to bring the old\\xa0\\xa0 and the new the good and the bad or whatever\\xa0\\ntogether into one city very very beautifully\\xa0\\xa0 yeah didn't expect that at all definitely there's\\xa0 very obviously a contrast in this city we're\\xa0\\xa0 talking obviously about a city i said this in the\\xa0\\nlast video but just so you guys know warsaw was\\xa0\\xa0 pretty much totally flattened it was around 80-85%\\nof warsaw was flattened destroyed in world war ii\\xa0\\xa0 and now walking through it as of today in july\\xa0\\n2022 this place is booming there's a lot going\\xa0\\xa0 on there's a lot of people working there's a\\xa0\\nlot of job opportunities from what i've heard\\xa0\\xa0 there's plenty of companies that are coming\\xa0\\nhere there's not that many people that are\\xa0\\xa0 actually leaving and i'm hearing there's a lot of\\xa0\\nreally great universities here in warsaw as well\\xa0\\xa0 so many foreigners as well like all over\\xa0\\npoland obviously we saw some tourists here\\xa0\\xa0 and there but it was very obvious that they were\\xa0\\ntourists and i feel like here in warsaw you have\\xa0\\xa0 loads of people i feel like a lot of asian people\\xa0\\nfor example a lot of english-speaking people\\xa0\\xa0 that seem like they actually live here which i\\xa0\\nthink is very surprising i didn't expect that\\xa0\\xa0 at all beforehand yeah i think there's\\xa0\\na huge japanese community as well we\\xa0\\xa0 saw that there's quite a few youtubers that\\xa0\\nare posting very commonly from warsaw that\\xa0\\xa0 are japanese and we noticed that there is a very\\xa0\\nlarge japanese community here and to be honest\\xa0\\xa0 diversity is a great thing for a capital city\\xa0\\nand for a country in general because you get\\xa0\\xa0 introduced to so many different cultures\\xa0\\naspects and different things you get to\\xa0\\xa0 witness all of these different types of food as\\xa0\\nwell i think on the first day we had like ramen\\xa0\\xa0 and it was actually like authentic japanese\\xa0\\nramen the first day we arrived in warsaw\\xa0\\xa0 which was really good like i didn't as i said i\\xa0\\ndidn't expect all of this from warsaw but it's\\xa0\\xa0 so so beautiful and so diverse and really\\xa0\\nworth putting on your list yeah for sure\\xa0\\xa0 and obviously if you do want to get around the\\xa0\\ncity in a handier way there's plenty of options\\xa0\\xa0 here in warsaw you do have a tram system which\\xa0\\nthe tracks are just over here and there's also\\xa0\\xa0 we see plenty of people going around on electric\\xa0\\nscooters there seems to be a very well connected\\xa0\\xa0 system of electric scooter apps like lime and\\xa0\\nstuff like that that are set up here and you see\\xa0\\xa0 people going to work every day on those scooters\\xa0\\ntoo so it is a very very well developed and\\xa0\\xa0 certainly 100 percent we would recommend you guys\\xa0\\nif you're watching this video to come for yourself\\xa0\\xa0 and experience warsaw and we kind of\\xa0\\nstarted our journey in poland in the south\\xa0\\xa0 in kraków and we're very grateful that we did\\xa0\\nthat because kraków is kind of one of those cities\\xa0\\xa0 that often would get compared with warsaw you\\xa0\\nkind of have kraków then you have warsaw and Gdansk\\xa0\\xa0 and obviously zakopane but zakopane is a much\\xa0\\nsmaller place so if you're really talking like top\\xa0\\xa0 three most visited large city destinations it's\\xa0\\nprobably going to be Gdansk warsaw and then kraków\\xa0\\xa0 and we've been to all three of those\\xa0\\nand to be honest if i had to pick one\\xa0\\xa0 out of those three cities i'm going for warsaw\\xa0 in terms of somewhere that i would actually\\xa0\\xa0 spend a long period of time like if i had to\\xa0\\npick somewhere where i'm going to live for\\xa0\\xa0 like longer than two weeks or something like\\xa0\\nthat i'm definitely going to pick this city i\\xa0\\xa0 think out of those three what about you yeah but\\xa0\\nLuke is a city boy because he grew up in dublin\\xa0\\xa0 so he always tends to pick cities like\\xa0\\nlarger cities over smaller villages if\\xa0\\xa0 i had to pick between Gdansk kraków and warsaw\\xa0\\ni would probably go with oh it's a difficult\\xa0\\xa0 decision actually it is tough i would probably\\xa0\\ngo with Gdansk but just because i like the\\xa0\\xa0 the charm the charm of the city and kind of a\\xa0\\nlittle bit more of a like older architecture and\\xa0\\xa0 that's really what i'm what i'm into and i'm\\xa0\\nnot so much of a larger city person as Luke is\\xa0\\xa0 yeah i definitely am a city person it's\\xa0\\nreally funny actually the contrast between\\xa0\\xa0 me and naomi because i typically love larger\\xa0\\ncities and i thrive when i'm amongst you know\\xa0\\xa0 thousands of people and i like that general\\xa0\\natmosphere naomi is much more towards the ocean\\xa0\\xa0 smaller like more local types of places\\xa0\\nand i actually i love that side of things\\xa0\\xa0 as well don't get me wrong i just like being\\xa0 amongst other people because it's a much\\xa0\\xa0 easier and quicker way to sort of socialize with\\xa0\\nthe people in certain countries you get more of a\\xa0\\xa0 sense as well of what the general vibe of certain\\xa0\\ncountries are and obviously there's the diversity\\xa0\\xa0 aspect as well so when you're in a place that\\xa0\\nis a giant city you feel like you get many many\\xa0\\xa0 different experiences in one little location but\\xa0\\nyeah nonetheless we're going gonna take you guys\\xa0\\xa0 for another maybe five or ten minutes or so\\xa0\\nthrough this city um you might be able to see\\xa0\\xa0 this point up here on the distance that's\\xa0\\nactually the palace of culture and science\\xa0\\xa0 and where we were actually where we kind\\xa0\\nof started off our first warsaw video\\xa0\\xa0 and it's actually very very cool it's one\\xa0\\nof the most unique looking buildings i think\\xa0\\xa0 in warsaw it's such a great building and\\xa0\\nwhen we were in that palace i i couldn't\\xa0\\xa0 believe my eyes it's such a stunning place and\\xa0\\nthe view that you have from the tower up there\\xa0\\xa0 is just truly beautiful and amazing i didn't\\xa0\\nlike i don't know i just couldn't believe my\\xa0\\xa0 eyes when we were up there to be honest it's so\\xa0\\nbeautiful yeah it's a it's amazing and we saw\\xa0\\xa0 oh check this out people selling some\\xa0\\nnice fresh rhubarb and vegetables etc\\xa0\\xa0 which again something about warsaw which\\xa0\\nis truly spectacular you have the large\\xa0\\xa0 chain retail stores and you have got plenty of\\xa0\\nlike super shopping centers etc etc but then\\xa0\\xa0 you also have people that are randomly selling\\xa0\\nvegetables and fruit out of the trunk of their car\\xa0\\xa0 and so that's again talking about the specific\\xa0\\ncontrast if you will of this city that's where\\xa0\\xa0 you're really going to see it warsaw as well\\xa0\\nis a fantastic city actually you know what\\xa0\\xa0 all of poland in general is an incredible country\\xa0\\nif you are into music concerts and festivals and\\xa0\\xa0 there's so many different concerts we didn't even\\xa0\\nrealize this until we first arrived in poland but\\xa0\\xa0 we started looking around and we saw all of these\\xa0\\nbillboards and stuff while we were in katowice and\\xa0\\xa0 kraków plenty of other places and here in warsaw\\xa0\\nas well but you see all these billboards and you\\xa0\\xa0 see how many like free concerts that there are\\xa0\\nin poland and it's astounding it's crazy for me\\xa0\\xa0 coming from dublin it really just doesn't happen\\xa0\\nvery often for me like we saw a lot of people\\xa0\\xa0 here wearing rammstein stuff and people wearing\\xa0\\nbandanas and t-shirts and hoodies with rammstein\\xa0\\xa0 and it turned out that they just recently played\\xa0\\nhere or they're doing a tour and they're making\\xa0\\xa0 their way through poland we also got invited\\xa0\\nto a polish open-air free rock festival which\\xa0\\xa0 unfortunately we're not going to be in the country\\xa0\\nfor but yeah the culture and the free concerts\\xa0\\xa0 and the live music atmosphere in this country\\xa0\\nis just truly astounding and i love it and it's\\xa0\\xa0 really really great to see because so many people\\xa0\\njust seem to know how to enjoy themselves let's\\xa0\\xa0 put it that way i do believe that the rammstein\\xa0\\nconcert however probably was paid for and oh yeah\\xa0\\xa0 there is this one free rock festival i believe\\xa0\\nit's in the beginning of august and uh in\\xa0\\xa0 the lineup with something like limp bizkit or\\xa0\\nsomething like that for free yeah it's poland\\xa0\\xa0 rock is the name poland rock where is that\\xa0 i have no idea the name of the actual town if\\xa0\\xa0 you guys do know the name of the town make sure to\\xa0\\ndrop it down below for us so other people if they\\xa0\\xa0 are watching this and they do want to go that they\\xa0\\ncan go and we will pin your comment at the top\\xa0\\xa0 we actually saw a concert i believe it was\\xa0\\nin katowice we saw a jazz and funk type of\\xa0\\xa0 concert from somebody who plays saxophone\\xa0 which was absolutely amazing what was the\\xa0\\xa0 what's that not i know her name yeah Candy Dulpher\\xa0 but like the the place where it was it\\xa0\\xa0 was called like nosp n-o-s-p in katowice and it's\\xa0\\nsupposedly one of the best acoustics to have\\xa0\\xa0 for live music and it was really really good\\xa0\\nyeah the the setup of the the concert hall itself\\xa0\\xa0 it was kind of round and the stage was in\\xa0\\nthe middle so that people could actually\\xa0\\xa0 sit all around the stage and then see candy\\xa0\\ndulpher from every side basically which i have\\xa0\\xa0 never seen before it was a very interesting setup\\xa0\\nyeah it was really really cool and that's again\\xa0\\xa0 like what i mean when i'm saying poland is just so\\xa0\\nincredibly unique in that way because there's just\\xa0\\xa0 nothing like that happening in ireland for for me\\xa0\\nwhere i'm from i'm sure there is in a lot of\\xa0\\xa0 other european destinations but for me poland in\\xa0\\ngeneral it's really just shocked us and blown us\\xa0\\xa0 away in that regard it's just an unlimited amount\\xa0\\nof things that you can spend your time doing and\\xa0\\xa0 there's so many different ways to socialize with\\xa0\\npeople as well and then i believe we saw like a\\xa0\\xa0 series of free concerts in Toruń because in Toruń\\xa0\\nbecause they had kind of a festival going on there\\xa0\\xa0 for the city i don't actually know why\\xa0\\nthere was a festival but there were loads\\xa0\\xa0 and loads of free concerts all over the\\xa0\\ncity which was really amazing to see and\\xa0\\xa0 the performers there like they were not well\\xa0\\nnot like world known performers at least not\\xa0\\xa0 to us but they were truly amazing and all of\\xa0\\nthat for free just kind of stumbling into the\\xa0\\xa0 concert and just staying wherever you want\\xa0\\nfor a while or checking out the next artists\\xa0\\xa0 that was really amazing to see yep now guys we are\\xa0\\napproaching the palace of culture and science you\\xa0\\xa0 can see it off there in the distance this video\\xa0\\nis getting pretty long we're like 26 minutes in\\xa0\\xa0 if you guys are still watching this video thank\\xa0\\nyou very much make sure to drop a nice big thumbs\\xa0\\xa0 up on this video we are going to have a few more\\xa0\\nvideos about poland as i said pronunciation video\\xa0\\xa0 and then we have a couple more videos in the mix\\xa0\\nfor you before we head off but check this out huge skyscrapers here yeah it's really really cool\\xa0\\nit's beautiful and you have a mixture as we said a\\xa0\\xa0 total contrast of all of these different buildings\\xa0\\nand the palace of culture and science i believe\\xa0\\xa0 is the second tallest building in all of\\xa0\\npoland and then you do have one other one\\xa0\\xa0 which begins with a v that is somewhere close\\xa0\\nto it i believe it's actually this one\\xa0\\xa0 that's just appearing here oh yeah it's called\\xa0\\nthe varso and it's supposed to be taller but\\xa0\\xa0 from here because of the perspective where we're\\xa0\\nstanding it does not look as tall as the palace\\xa0\\xa0 of culture and science but nonetheless this\\xa0\\ncity just makes your jaw drop everywhere you go\\xa0\\xa0 there's a lot of beauty to it there's also a\\xa0\\nlot of areas that are pretty grey but i'm not\\xa0\\xa0 gonna lie warsaw definitely somewhere that i felt\\xa0\\nhave fallen in love with for sure i think what is\\xa0\\xa0 really interesting about the city as well is\\xa0\\nthat in a lot of areas you have these tunnel\\xa0\\xa0 type of systems as we're going to see now because\\xa0\\nwe have to walk through it so if you want to avoid\\xa0\\xa0 waiting for the traffic light you can just head\\xa0\\ninto one of these tunnels and then just pop out on\\xa0\\xa0 the other side something that you don't see in a\\xa0\\nwhole lot of european cities and i believe we have\\xa0\\xa0 some of those in germany as well but like very\\xa0\\nlimited and only if it's like tied to a like an\\xa0\\xa0 underground train or something like that like you\\xa0\\nwouldn't have just casually a passage like this\\xa0\\xa0 it's really cool though like just a super\\xa0\\nconvenient way to cut just cut your way through\\xa0\\xa0 the city hopefully the lighting is okay here\\xa0\\nwe shoot all of our videos just on a gopro\\xa0\\xa0 and it's not really the right camera for low\\xa0\\nlighting situations but nonetheless we are\\xa0\\xa0 just about to cut through and arrive at the\\xa0\\npalace of culture and science i hope you guys\\xa0\\xa0 are enjoying this little quick insight into what\\xa0\\na day in our life looks like this is our last\\xa0\\xa0 last day exploring around warsaw so we're just\\xa0\\nreally trying to get as much as many steps in\\xa0\\xa0 as we can and just kind of take in the atmosphere\\xa0\\nbefore we head off but there's the building itself\\xa0\\xa0 guys and this is probably the perfect location\\xa0\\nor the perfect destination to wrap this video up our journey in warsaw started at this building and\\xa0\\nit ends at this building exactly so guys for now\\xa0\\xa0 my name is luke my name is naomi we are\\xa0\\nthe two mad explorers and this is your\\xa0\\xa0 reminder to keep exploring see you guys\\xa0\\nin the next video thanks for watching

       " \"are you renting a flood in poland or maybe you are about to sign an agreement today i will tell you about a very important and quite difficult thing the real estate and rental laws in poland what are the obligation of the landlord and the tenant what official rules you have to follow and how to protect yourselves stay with me and you will know all the answers [Music] law is tough thing i know the official language raised a lot of doubts and questions but here comes our explanation in the easiest possible way with our guide you will finally understand it let's start with the most important thing from your perspective as a tenant duties of landlord and the tenant of course both ladders and tenants have their responsibilities it's good to know what you can demand but also what rules you have to follow let's go for the most important ones maintenance and repairs according to polish law the landlord is responsible for all the mechanicals and appliances in the building and in the apartment that allows you to use things like electricity water heating elevator gas but what does it exactly mean in other easier words he takes care of the maintenance of central heating plumbing electrical installation he is doing all the necessary repairs and the costs are on his side before you move in the landlord is responsible to check the apartment and make all the repairs of course things wear out over time and the lander has to prepare the flat for the next tenant as i mentioned in a previous video you cannot be charged for the regular wear and tear but the term regular wear and turn must be clarified if the pot is burnt the pan is squashed so the teflon is off or the couch is so dirty that it cannot be clean it's not a regular wear and tear the lander has the full right to charge you for the replacement i know that the dirty couch can still be used but put yourself in the place of a new tenant would you really like to rent a flat with a dirty couch not to mention that the burned pot is dangerous for your health let's give more examples if the heating system stops working the ladder has to come and fix it and costs are on his side also if the fridge or oven stops working because it's old the lantern has to replace it and the costs are also on his side if the flooring in your apartment breaks just because it's low quality is not your fault but if you drop something and make a hole you have to pay for the reaper what about the building its surroundings and the staircase all owners of the apartment in the building creates a whole owner's association called spunota mieshkanyova your landlord is part of it and has some influence on that but he cannot repair anything on its own in the building right away for example if the salvage system in the building is clogged the homeowner association has to organize plumbers and pays for the repairs your lander should inform you right away about the problem but he cannot fix it on his own here same as in the apartment if you damage something in the building or staircase you have to pay for the repairs so remember you are responsible not only for your apartment but the building as well changes in the apartment interior design what about changing anything in the apartment well be prudent and upgrade ulef in polish can only be done with the written permission of the android well not everything is an upgrade for example if you are changing a painting in a frame or hanging blinds just keep the original ones it's not an upgrade as it doesn't increase the value of the flat and it's easy to remove however if you plan to do something bigger like painting walls or hanging a shelf as you make holes in a wall you must have a written permission of the language according to polish law after ending the lease flat must be in the same condition as at the beginning well it's easy to say but how to do this first of all be consistent clean the flood regularly and maintain it in a good condition for carpets furniture etc if something breaks let your laundry know right away the kettle won't magically repair itself and at the beginning it can be easier and cheaper to repair before the damage gets worse when you know the move out date prepare the flat of course you have to take all your belongings but also throw out trash clean cabinets furniture toilet and everything else not only on the outside but also on the inside don't forget to clean the windows if you don't do it properly your ladder can ask you to pay for an extra cleaning service if during the lease you replaced or repaired something you have the right to get the refund but only in case you have the written permission of the landlord if you replace something without his knowledge he doesn't have to keep things you bought and you have to take them when moving out so please always ask the landlord first now let's talk about very important issue which is rental pricing trees can the android change the rental price during the rental time the answer is yes but he has to inform you in written form no longer than on the last day of the month you have the right to keep the rental increase notice the provisional staff key change it's not the same as the rental termination notice the termination notice is usually three months or it can be longer if the list says so then you have two months to let him know if you don't agree to the increase you have to move out for example if the rental increase is announced from the 1st of february your rental increase notice is calculated from the 1st of november till the 31st of january full 3 months the lender has to provide you with determined rental increase notice by the end of october by the end of december you have to let the landlord know that you don't agree for the increase then by the end of january you have to move out the another has arrived to increase the rental price maximum once every six month but please remember that it only applies to the rental price not the advanced monthly payment for the utilities if the city increased the charge of the waste disposal three times a year the lender has right to increase it too important in poland paper is a must well you don't need the written correspondence with your landlord it can be done via email but when it comes to important documents like ending the contract or signing an annex it must be done on paper with your hand-written signature by your hand no copy and paste or created in a computer program signature is not valid early contract termination is it even possible both the landers and the tenant have a right to end the contract earlier but under a certain conditions as i said in the previous video before you sign the lease as your lender if it's possible to end the contract earlier in general according to polish law the lease with a termination date cannot be entered before its date you can do it if you have a contract without a stated termination date in this case you can end the contract with a three months termination notice but be careful your lender can end the contract earlier if you are not paying the rent you don't in the apartment and in general you don't care about it you sublease the apartment you party a lot and your neighbors complain the building you live in needs to be torn down or renovated i know these are some extreme situation but i want you to know insurance insurance is a very important thing that we usually don't think about but it's good to have it of course your landlord will or at least should have some thanks to that you are protected from unexpected events like a broken washing machine in your neighbor's flat that floats your apartment however you can also ensure yourself from the damage that you caused or something unexpected happen for example breaking a glass door shower or a theft the insurance is called civil liability insurance and it's relatively cheap compared to the damage that you can make highly recommended not a react your landlord can ask you to sign an agreement in the form of notary act and there is nothing to be afraid about i know that you're an honest and responsible person so don't stress when the lender suggests signing and not react usually he is the one who prepares everything he will set up a date find the translator and probably he will pay for that i will only tell you that we have two types of notary act occasionally when you as a tenant sign a contract with a private person and institutional lease when your landlord is a company here are some other useful pieces of information the lander cannot enter the apartment without your permission during the lease however the lisa agreement can indicate the periodical inspections in your presence exception in the urgent and dangerous case the ladder can enter your apartment without your permission or presence but only with the policeman as a foreigner you may not want to pay in polish zloty you can ask another if it's possible to pay in different currency like euros or u.s dollars a private owner should may not give you such a possibility but the company should have if you need some more help you can always ask the rental agency but remember it's connected with the commission fee it is usually a month friend plus 23 of tax but remember not all the companies are rental agencies some of them owns the apartments so we don't pay for the commission fee if you are not sure if the person renting the apartment is entitled to do so you can always check it in your land and mortgage register number exchange how to do this check out our guide the link is in the description okay guys now i think you know everything about renting an apartment and nothing should surprise you

       " \"Ukraine's largest neighbor on its Western border is Poland, NATO and European Union member that has has had its own long and violent history with Russia as Vladimir Putin looks to accelerate the war I sat down in New York early this afternoon with Poland's president on J. Dura. President Duda Thank you very much for talking with us. Let's start with Ukraine. You've just listened to President Biden's remarks at the United Nations, where he said, what President Putin has done in taking over territory that doesn't belong to him. And now with this overt threat of nuclear Ah, weaponry. Uh, did it should make our blood run cold? Is that how you take what's going on? Russia is in a difficult situation. Russia has demonstrated its weakness what Russia has been doing so far in Ukraine, the aggression and all the outrageous dimensions of the war, which Russia demonstrated in Ukraine. As a matter of fact, have turned out to be a failure of Russia. Russia tries to change its tactics At the same time it tries to threaten the world with nuclear weapons. How does the statement from President Putin that he is going to mobilize up to hundreds of thousands more troops? To fight this war that he's in this for the long haul. How does that change the war right now? Please bear in mind that at the beginning before the war happened, the experts were saying it would be enough for Russia to conquer the whole of Ukraine. Within 72 hours, however, they failed to seize the whole of Ukraine. You can see an attempt to save face in this mobilization. This partial mobilization, which was announced in Russia well, it causes a horror among his society because thousands of Russian soldiers have already died in Ukraine. There will be further thousands following. This is going to be the policy of the Russian authorities right now, so we can see a weakness of Russia in this respect. So are you saying you keep referring to Russian weakness? Are you saying that the rest of the world should not take his threats seriously when he says we're prepared to use all means necessary, and clearly they have an enormous nuclear arsenal. First of all, nobody attacked Russia. Nobody attacked Russia. The Russian aggression in Ukraine is a totally unprovoked aggression Number two. They have committed murders there, and they know that today they are threatened by criminal accountability. Therefore, the Russian authorities in Vladimir Putin started to threaten. What can they threaten with the only thing they can threaten with his nuclear weapons if this Ukraine, which is defending itself, which has no nuclear weapons? Ukraine is attacked by nuclear weapons even to the smallest degree, even if they were the so called tactical nuclear weapons used the most modern ones, the smallest ones that would break the world taboo in Russia would find itself on the margins of any sensible political debate whatsoever. The whole world would turn its back on Russia. Even those countries which today support Russia's silently or openly even those countries will find themselves in a dramatic position, and they will have to say that Russia will have violated all the principles. So what should Ukraine and the West do right now? You are describing Russia is backed into a corner, making threats out of weakness. What should Ukraine and the West oop provide more weapons to Ukraine? What needs to happen now? Where do you see this going? One should support Ukraine in a consistent and stable way. Also by providing military equipment to Ukraine. Why, Because in order to be able to speak about an Orderly world about a world in which piece is going to be guarded and protected. Then Ukraine has to regain control over its internationally recognized borders. One has to support Ukraine to make sure that it defends itself so that Russians are forced to withdraw from Ukraine to give back the occupied lands to Ukraine. And then we have to help Ukraine rebuild itself. This is the most important task facing us today, Ukraine has to regain its territory. Russia has to withdraw. The primacy of international law has to be restored. Are you absolutely confident Russia will not use nuclear weapons? Tiniest not well. This is a question which you cannot give an answer to. Nobody can be sure of that. 100% Russia, which is never used nuclear weapons so far, and I want to stress this point, never, ever, even in the times of the most acute Cold war, even in the times when the tensions were running high, Russia has never applied nuclear weapons, and in particular, it has never used nuclear weapons against the state, which is not equipped with nuclear weapons itself. That would break all the taboos, and I believe that the Russian authorities know that perfectly well, it is not only Vladimir Putin also the inner circle of Vladimir Putin, also the strategic military decisions. The West has been largely united. Against Russia up until now, But if this war drags on for a very long time, with the economy being what it is with winter coming, are you concerned at all that that unity could could come apart? Says. But of course, this situation is very challenging. There are two overarching topics. First of all the energy crisis in secondly, inflation, Of course, on top of that there is a third extremely important topic, namely the food crisis. But the question that arises is as follows if we want to have an easier life. If we want to pay lower prices. Are we going to agree for the sake of that to one of the nation's independence, sovereignty and freedom? Can we agree to one European country which wants to be a Democratic state, which wants to belong to the Western community and be a free independent state? If we agree to that, then Russia will not stop. It will want to bite off other pieces of territory. It will want to seize the Baltic states, perhaps my country, Poland. Perhaps it will also So wants to seize Bulgaria, The Czech Republic, Slovakia. This is the former Soviet sphere of influence. We have to say no to this, and we are saying No Last question is about your country about Poland. You are clearly siding with the West in opposing what Putin and the Russians are doing in Ukraine at the same time your country has taken. What is seen in the United States by the US Biden administration is some extreme positions. There was a challenge to independent television network. There are questions about the independence of your judiciary. Your country's policy toward abortion is a very extreme with their extreme limits on abortion in Poland, So my question is the is the United States looks at your government positions you've taken. It's been. The question is raised. Is this a country that's moving in an authoritarian Direction or in the direction of democracy. What's your answer? First, Let's start with the following. Poland is a sovereign, independent and free state program, which is being implemented in Poland, including the political program is the program which voters wanted to have. These are purely democratic principles. This is how it functions important today. I'm listening to my voters, and hence I'm making decisions which I believe meet their expectations. They are just decisions. Wrecked ones. In their perspective. I believe the president of the Republic of Poland has got this authority in our country and has constitutional powers. The president has instruments to stop any given amendment. Everybody knew who I am and what my convictions are. When I was running for president. I was not hiding anything. My mandate is the mandate, which I won democratically in there haven't ever been any doubts about that in Poland and implementing the mandate today. With full responsibility. We're going to leave it there. President Duda we thank you very much\",\n",

       " '  THE PRESIDENCY BECOMES TO THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE ALONE.  >>> SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE  AMERICAN MILITARY TOUCHED DOWN  IN POLAND EARLY SATURDAY.  PRESIDENT BIDEN IS ALSO SENDING  THOUSANDS OF TROOPS TO THE  REGION AS A SHOW OF FORCE.  CBS NEWS FOREIGN AFFAIRS  CORRESPONDENT CHRISTINA RAFINI  HAS THE LATEST FROM THE WHITE  HOUSE.  >> Reporter: IN A PRECISE AND  VERY PUBLIC PERFORMANCE,  RUSSIAN AND BELARUSSIAN FORCES  MOVE ACROSS THE NORTH UKRAINIAN  BORDER, A MILITARY DRESS  REHEARSAL FOR A NIGHT THAT MAY  OR MAY NOT COME.  MESH OFFICIALS SAY THEY DO NOT  BELIEVE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT  VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS DECIDED IF  HE WILL MOVE AGAINST UKRAINE,  BUT A FULL-SCALE INVASION WOULD  LIKELY BEGIN WITH AIR STRIKES  AND LONG-RANGE MILITARY,  FOLLOWED BY ARMORED ADVANCES ON  SEVERAL FRONT SEAT.  PUTIN IS UNLIKELY TO LAUNCH AN  INVASION DURING THE WINTER  OLYMPICS, WHERE HE IS ONE OF  THE FEW MEMBERS IN ATTENDANCE.  HIS HIGH-PROFILE MEETING WITH  THE CHINESE PRESIDENT ENDED IN  A JOINT STATEMENT THAT INCLUDED  ONE OF PUTIN\\'S KEY DEMANDS, AN  END TO NATO EXPANSION.  >> WE STRONGLY PREFER THAT  RUSSIA CHOOSE THE PATH OF  DIPLOMACY AND DIALOGUE, BUT IF  IT DOES NOT, WE ARE FULLY  PREPARED FOR THE ALTERNATIVE.  >> Reporter: MEANWHILE,  SECRETARY OF STATE ANTHONY  LINCOLN MET WITH HIS POLISH  COUNTERPART AS AMERICAN FORCES  ARE EXPECTED TO ARRIVE IN  POLAND AS SOON AS THIS WEEKEND,  AND 8,200 ADDITIONAL TROOPS ARE  ON STANDBY TO REINFORCE NATO  ALLIES SHOULD RUSSIA DECIDE TO  PUT ON MORE THAN JUST A SHOW.  U.S. MILITARY OFFICIALS HAVE  SAID, IF PUTIN DOES DECIDE TO  INVADE, IT COULD MEAN AS MANY  AS A HUNDRED THOUSAND CIVILIAN  CASUALTIES AND UP TO 5 MILLION  REFUGEES IN THE LARGEST  CONFLICT EUROPE WILL HAVE SEEN  SINCE WORLD WAR II.  SO FAR, RUSSIA AND U.S. SAY  THEY ARE WILLING TO CONTINUE  PURSUING DIPLOMACY.  >> THANK YOU.  LET\\'S BRING IN NATIONAL  SECURITY REPORTER O OLIVIA  GAZES.  GREAT TO HAVE YOU AGAIN.  LET\\'S START OFF WITH THE  AMERICAN TROOPS IN THE REGION.  WHAT HAPPENS IF RUSSIA, IN  FACT, INVADES UKRAINE?  WHAT\\'S THE PLAN FOR AMERICAN  TROOPS?  >> SURE.  WHAT THE U.S. ANNOUNCED THIS  WEEK IT WAS THE ADDITIONAL  DEPLOYMENT OF ABOUT 2,000  TROOPS.  MOST ARE GOING TO BE HEADED  INTO POLAND, WHICH IS A NATO  MEMBER, AND ALREADY HOSTS  THOUSANDS OF NATO TROOPS IN ITS  TERRITORY.  ANOTHER 1,000 U.S. TROOPS  CURRENTLY STATIONED IN GERMANY  ARE GOING TO MOVE FARTHER EAST  TO ROMANIA.  THESE TROOPS ARE ESSENTIALLY  GOING NEARER, BUT NOT INTO THE  POTENTIAL CONFLICT ZONE.  THESE DEPLOYMENTS ARE ALL IN  ADDITION THAT PREVIOUSLY  ANNOUNCED 8,500 TROOPS THAT ARE  IN A STATE OF HEIGHTENED  READINESS, BUT STILL STATESIDE.  AND WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS  SOUGHT TO EMPHASIZE THROUGHOUT  THIS PROCESS IS THAT NONE OF  THESE TROOPS IS EXPECTED TO  ACTUALLY FIGHT IN UKRAINE IN  THE EVENT OF AN INVASION.  THEY\\'RE BEING DEPLOYED PURELY  FOR DETERRENCE PURPOSES AND FOR  THE DEFENSE OF NATO COUNTRIES  SHOULD THE CONFLICT SPREAD  BEYOND UKRAINIAN BORDERS.  THAT SAID, OF COURSE, THE U.S.  AND EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HAVE  BEEN STEADILY SENDING DEFENSIVE  MILITARY EQUIPMENT INTO  UKRAINE, OFFERING TRAINING.  SO WHILE U.S. TROOPS WON\\'T BE  JOINING THE UKRAINIANS AT THE  FRONT, THE U.S. HAS BEEN  SEEKING TO BOLSTER UKRAINIAN  DEFENSES IN THE FACE OF A  POTENTIAL RUSSIAN ATTACK.  >> SO, O OLIVIA, THAT\\'S THE  PART THAT I THINK IS CONFUSING  FOR FOLKS, IS PRESIDENT BIDEN  SAID AMERICAN TROOPS ARE NOT  GOING TO BE FIGHTING IF THERE  IS A RUSSIAN INVASION, AND YET  WE\\'RE SEEING AMERICAN TROOPS GO  OVER THERE.  WHAT ROLE ARE THEY GOING TO  PLAY?  AND HOW DOES IT WORK FOR  DETERRENCE IF WE\\'RE SAYING THEY  ARE NOT GOING TO ENTER THE  BATTLEFIELD.  >> THEY ARE SAYING WE ARE GOING  TO DEFEND THESE TERRITORIES.  OF COURSE, UKRAINE, NOT BEING A  MEMBER, DOESN\\'T ENJOY THE  BENEFITS OF THE ARTICLE 5 PACT  THAT THESE OTHER COUNTRIES DO  ENJOY.  SO WHILE IT IS A PARTNER THAT  HAS BEEN GETTING SOME  REINFORCEMENTS FROM U.S. AND  NATO ALLIES, IT CAN\\'T BE PRIVY  TO THAT DEFENSIVE COALITION  THAT NATO MEMBERS OTHERWISE  ENJOY.  >> WELL, OLIVIA, EUROPEAN  ALLIES HAVE ALSO SCHEDULED  MEETINGS WITH THE LEADERS OF  RUSSIA AND UKRAINE NEXT WEEK.  TELL US, IS DEESCALATION  THROUGH DIPLOMACY A FEASIBLE  OPTION AT THIS POINT?  >> SURE.  SO WE\\'RE AT A POINT WHERE THERE  ARE REALLY TWO REALITIES IN  TENSION.  ONE IS THAT RUSSIA HAS  MANEUVERED ITSELF INTO A  POSITION WHERE IT HAS MULTIPLE  OPTIONS.  IT CAN LAUNCH ANYTHING FROM A  SMALL-SCALE INVASION INTO  EASTERN UKRAINE TO A MASSIVE  INVASION OF THE WHOLE OF  UKRAINE, ON SEVERAL FRONT SEAT,  AND ON VERY SHORT NOTICE.  THE SECOND REALITY IS RUSSIA IS  CONTINUING TO SHOW UP AT THESE  DIPLOMATIC CONVERSATIONS.  IT IS CONTINUING TO BE WILLING  TO TALK.  IN ADDITION THESE MEETINGS WITH  EUROPEAN LEADERS THIS WEEK, WE  ARE STILL WAITING ON A WRITTEN  RESPONSE FROM THE RUSSIANS TO  THE U.S. PROPOSAL THAT WAS SENT  OVER THERE LAST MONTH.  SO ONCE VLADIMIR PUTIN SIGNS  OFF ON THAT RESPONSE, WE\\'LL GET  SOME MORE CLARITY ON WHAT IS  DIPLOMATICALLY STILL POSSIBLE  VIS-A-VIS THE RUSSIANS.  ALL OF THAT IS ENCOURAGING; BUT  YOU KNOW, RUSSIA HAS BEEN  AMASSING MORE, NOT LESS  LEVERAGE, OVER THE PAST SEVERAL  MONTHS.  IT WAS ESPECIALLY EVIDENT  YESTERDAY, AS YOU HEARD, WE SAW  THIS WARMING AND DEEPENING OF  RUSSIA\\'S STRATEGIC  COLLABORATION WITH THE CHINESE,  THE TWO RELEASING THAT LENGTHY  JOINT STATEMENT THAT MADE VERY  CLEAR THEY\\'RE WILLING TO  PARTNER IN CERTAIN AREAS TO  SERVE AS A COUNTERBALANCE TO  THE U.S..  >> RIGHT.  >> SO THE MORE OPTIONS THAT  RUSSIA CONTINUES TO ACCUMULATE  FOR ITSELF, THE MORE DIFFICULT  IT IS GOING TO BE FOR WESTERN  DIPLOMATS TO ARRIVE AT SOME  SORT OF DIPLOMATIC RESOLUTION  THAT WILL STILL SATISFY  VLADIMIR PUTIN.  >> YEAH.  IT DOESN\\'T SEEM LIKE EITHER THE  DIPLOMACY OR THE TROOP BUILDUP  HAVE REALLY MADE MUCH OF A  DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF  DEESCALATING THE CONFLICT.  AND, OLIVIA, I WANT TO ASK YOU  ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.  OUR COLLEAGUE, KELLY WILLIAMS,  ANCHORED LIVE COVERAGE OF CBS  NEWS FROM UKRAINE FRIDAY, AND  SHE DETAILED RUSSIA\\'S PLANNING  OF STAGED VIDEO SHOWING AN  ATTACK FROM UKRAINE.  YOU ALSO HAVE BEEN REPORTING ON  THIS.  WHAT ARE YOUR SOURCES SAYING,  AND WHAT DOES THIS SAY ABOUT  MOSCOW\\'S TACTICS?  >> SURE.  THE LATEST DISCLOSURES THIS  WEEK CAME FROM THE WHITE HOUSE,  AND ARE BASED ON WHAT THEY SAID  WAS DECLASSIFIED INTELLIGENCE,  THAT RUSSIA HAD PLANS TO  RELEASE THIS ELABORATELY STAGED  VIDEO OF A UKRAINIAN LED ATTACK  ON RUSSIAN FORCES THAT WOULD  USE CORPORATIONS AND EMPLOY  MORNING ACTORS TO DRUM UP  OUTRAGE AND CREATE A PRETEXT OF  AN INVASION.  THIS COMES AS A RUSSIAN CREATED  PRETEXT ISN\\'T NOTHING NEW, BUT  THE DETAILS OF THIS RATHER  ELABORATELY CREATED VIDEO ARE.  WHILE IT\\'S FAR-FETCHED AND  THERE HAS BEEN WELL-PLACED  SKEPTICISM AMONG JOURNALISTS IN  PARTICULAR THAT THIS IS THE  CASE, WE KNOW RUSSIA IS PRETTY  MUCH A MASTER OF DECEPTION, HAS  PLENTY OF EXPERIENCE IN  CREATING FAKE VIDEOS AND  LAUNCHING DISINFORMATION  CAMPAIGNS AND ISSUING  PROPAGANDA IT USES TO STOKE  PUBLIC SENTIMENT.  SO THE ADMINISTRATION IS  SAYING, \"WE ARE TELLING YOU AS  MUCH AS WE CAN TELL YOU WHILE  PROTECTING OUR SOURCES AND  METHODS SO THAT IF RUSSIA DOES  GO FORWARD WITH THIS PLAN, AS  FAR-FETCHED AS IT MIGHT BE, WE  WILL CALL IT OUT AND BLUNT ITS  EFFECTIVENESS, HOPEFULLY IN  ADVANCE.\"  >> LET\\'S SHIFT GEARS A LITTLE  BIT, BECAUSE I WANT TO DISCUSS  YOUR REPORTING ON THE ILLNESS  OF THE HAVANA SYNDROME.  THERE WAS A DECLASSIFIED  SUMMARY EARLIER THIS WEEK.  TELL OUR VIEWERS WHAT IT SAID.  >> SURE.  THIS WAS A PANEL THAT INCLUDED  SCIENTIFIC AND MEDICAL EXPERTS  INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE  GOVERNMENT, AND THEY WERE  LOOKING SPECIFICALLY AT WHAT  COULD PHYSICALLY BE CAUSING THE  SYMPTOMS THESE VICTIMS ARE  EXPERIENCING, WHICH IS EAR  RINGING, NAUSEA, REALLY INTENSE  HEADACHES, SOMETIMES TRAUMATIC  BRAIN INJURY.  AND SO THEY WERE EXAMINING A  RANGE OF HIGHLY TECHNICAL  THINGS, LIKE ACOUSTIC SIGNALS,  CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL AGENTS,  AND VARIOUS FORMS OF ELECTRO  MAGNETIC ENERGY.  THEY WERE NOT LOOKING INTO WHO  OR WHAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THIS,  LIKE A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT.  AND WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT  VICTIMS\\' SYMPTOMS COULD BE  PLAUSIBLY EXPLAINED BY PULSE  RADIO FREQUENCY ENERGY, OR  POSSIBLY ULTRASOUND, BUT THEY  SAID THAT INFORMATION GAP FOR  BOTH OF THOSE SCENARIOS EXIST.  THIS FINDING REAFFIRMS WHAT  PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE FOUND  ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF  DIRECTED ENERGY, AND THAT\\'S  IMPORTANT, BECAUSE IT KIND OF  HOLDS OPEN THE POSSIBILITY  THERE IS SOME NEFARIOUS  TECHNOLOGY OR WEAPON AT PLAY  HERE.  BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT  DOESN\\'T REALLY -- IT\\'S NOT  SUPER CONCLUSIVE, AND IT  DOESN\\'T REALLY BREAK ANY NEW  GROUND IN TERMS OF EXPLAINING  WHAT EXACTLY IS CAUSING THESE  SYMPTOMS.  >> STILL ',\n",

       " \"Katy and I are dessert lovers. So when we heard\\xa0that there is a Gingerbread City in \\nPoland it soared to the top of our must-see list. Especially\\xa0when we learned we could participate \\nin the making of these treats. Today we visit Toruń. One of\\xa0the most beautiful and historic cities in Poland. Its medieval core was decorated\\xa0a\\n UNESCO world heritage site in 1997. But today's video is for all\\xa0the gingerbread lovers like us. The very first item we have is our gingerbread\\xa0latte. And the vibes in there are super awesome. Great spot to just chill for a little bit. They\\xa0had other gingerbread items but we saw another gingerbread treat we want to go try next. And that would be paired greatly with this latte. But let's go ahead and take a sip of the\\xa0latte \\nbefore all this beautifulness disappears. We have a donut here. And I thought it was\\xa0going to be gingerbread filling. But it's actually gingerbread dough. You can select what\\xa0kind of filling you want. There's multi fruit. There's plum. But we went with black currant which sounds really fun. I think we had a Fanta like that in East Africa once. So let's see what this donut\\xa0tastes like. I ripped this in half because usually you have to take several bites before you get to the\\xa0filling. And I don't want to waste your guys's time. Things in Poland are unique for my American\\xa0palette. Because I'm used to everything being super sugary. So in America the dough would\\xa0have sugar in it. The filling would have tons of sugar and the icing on top of that. Here the\\xa0gingerbread tastes like gingerbread. But it's just more like a proper piece of bread. And the filling\\xa0is nice and flavorful without being overly sweet. And then all the sugar and the sweetness comes\\xa0from the icing. So it's really nice and flavorful without\\n giving you a major sugar rush. Do you\\xa0have patches? Pin? Not pin. Patches. Like to sew? Yes. Toruń? Oh she has patches, yeah. But these are Poland. I think\\xa0she has some of the city. That would be great. Yeah look at all the gingerbread things.\\xa0That's so cute. Yeah, so these are magnets. Oh, the original shape. Original gingerbread shape. Oh nice! What is it called? So it\\xa0should be a crest maybe? This is a crest? [Didn't understand.] Okay. Do you have a gingerbread patch? No only this. Okay. All right then yeah we'll definitely get this. If we happen to find\\xa0a gingerbread one that'd be cool too. But if not, we have our patch. We just wanted to know. What is the history of the gingerbread? These gingerbreads were produced\\n here until the first World War. And in late 19th century. Early 20th century. That was the biggest factory\\xa0of gingerbread in the whole world. Wow! That's cool. Yeah, you could find these gingerbreads even in... In Tokyo. In Honolulu Hawaii. Appeared here around 14th century. We're used to different\\xa0shapes. \\nSo where did they get the shape with the six circles? Or however do you describe it? There is the whole legend about it. One legend is about a young baker. Who decided to make two\\xa0hearts and two rings for Kate. That's like his girlfriend. He put all these shapes too close\\xa0to each other. Okay. And that's why it's this shape. We've got two gingerbreads over here. One that's\\xa0chocolate covered. One that's normal. Let's try them. True gingerbread. Not covered with sugar. Not covered with anything extra. Just pure gingerbread. Like a biscuit more than a cookie. There's a couple times we've had gingerbread \\ncookies from the Christmas markets. And\\xa0they just have all that sugary icing on top. Which I don't like. This I do like. Now let's try the chocolate covered one. I like this one because it gives it a little bit\\xa0of \\nan extra chocolate sweetness to it. But it's not milk chocolate. It tastes like a dark\\xa0chocolate. I do think I like this one better. We have a plate full of pierogi. And not just any\\xa0pierogi. But oven baked pierogi. We heard about this by doing our research. Through reading\\xa0comments on other YouTubers. And a lot of you guys recommended \\nto get these oven baked pierogi. So we have a fall / winter menu. And on this fall / winter menu were the pierogi that we got. Which\\xa0are filled with red lentils, cheese,\\n spinach, and mushrooms. Now we have five of these pierogi for\\xa032 złoty. And they are massive. We have had the traditional boiled pierogi before. And they're\\xa0about half the size. Maybe a third of the size of these. And I'm really excited to try these. I\\xa0already broke one in half. And it's definitely a lot harder. And very warm. They just came\\xa0out of the oven. So let's give this a taste. That packs a flavor for sure. And the outside reminds me of just\\xa0\\na dough that you would make in the oven. Now they did give us a sauce that you can pick. And I\\xa0asked which one would go well with these. And they said the garlic one. So I'm going to dip this into the sauce and try it. Okay. So this is a garlic dill sauce\\xa0actually. And this does complement the lentils very well. Now I\\xa0definitely recommend when you're in Poland to try not only the boiled\\xa0pierogi but also the oven baked pierogi. Doesn't work either. I started hearing stuff. We're supposed to be hearing English. Didn't hear anything. Don't hear anything. So before we start making gingerbread. Let's get to know each other a little bit. Who's here for working? But be honest. Who is hungry? OH! [Laughter] So, my name is Paul. I am a gingerbread master. And together we will teach you. At least try... How we bake gingerbread here in Toruń. Did you wash your hands before the work? Does hand sanitiser count? Squeeze it. Squeeze it. You can smell it. It's\\xa012 week old gingerbread dough. The same dough but after three months. Place it in a ball. On the table. And roll in the flour. Roll the dough in the flour. Make it flat. In a few moments we will be rolling it. Flatter. Make it flat. Place the mold next to your dough. Take the dough in your hands and\\xa0now\\n place the dough on the mold. Oil side on the picture.  Oh perfect! Good job! Okay! Awesome! In 10 minutes I think I will call you. Oh my gosh! It looks so good! You've done this before? Couldn't have done it without your help. Thank you. You're welcome. It\\xa0looks very nice. It about 8 minutes it will be ready. I love hands-on things. We just finished at\\xa0the gingerbread museum. It was absolutely worth it. It was so much fun. It was so\\xa0interactive. We not only were able to be hands-on and make gingerbread... Which this is\\xa0gingerbread you don't eat. It's just a souvenir. Prior to that they kind of explain the\\n process\\xa0of gingerbread making. And the people that we're hosting it... it kind of felt like a show. They\\xa0were dressed up. And unfortunately they gave us some headsets to \\nlisten to the translation in English. Those weren't working. But I think it worked out in our favor because the people\\xa0were just going back and forth between Polish and English. And they spoke great English. And they\\xa0were just very fun. And everyone in the room was having a blast. So yeah it was a great time\\xa0and we absolutely loved it. We're currently down in the dungeon. Well I guess cellar. But that\\xa0is because everyone was incredibly kind who works here and they allowed us to come down here. Since there's a lot of copyright music\\n upstairs and in the loft area. So we're down\\xa0here kind of all by ourselves. But we're still getting great service and we're really excited\\xa0because we have two different gingerbread beers. There's one that is cold. And that one is a dark\\xa0barley beer. With the aroma of spices and a hint of\\n cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon. And it's won\\xa0all kinds of awards. And then the second beer that we're gonna try is a mulled beer. And\\xa0that is hot as most mulled beverages are. And it has the addition of cloves and orange. So\\xa0let's try our gingerbread beer; the cold one. All day we've had a lot of different gingerbread\\xa0things. And most things aren't overpowering with the taste of ginger. Which is probably\\xa0better. Now let's try the mulled gingerbread beer. You smell the... It's almost impossible to stir\\xa0in the cinnamon. So you definitely smell the cinnamon and the rest of the spices. But mostly\\xa0cinnamon. That's a whole lot of flavors. Maybe because the orange is sitting\\n here at the top I\\xa0definitely taste orange. Is maybe the strongest flavor. And then like a hint of gingerbread. Both\\xa0very good. I think though I like the traditional gingerbread a little bit better. Also I don't know\\xa0if they have this everywhere. And I don't know if they have this back in the States. But we got a\\xa0gingerbread Twix. So in the convenience stores they have regular Twix. They also have some salted\\xa0caramel. And they have the gingerbread cookie Twix. So we're gonna try that too since \\nwe're here\\xa0in the gingerbread city. As George Costanza would say, 'Twix is\\n the only candy with a cookie\\xa0crunch'. And this one also has gingerbread cookie. So the difference between packaged Twix \\nand\\xa0everything else we've had here... Is you could definitely taste a lot of sugar. And you can\\xa0definitely taste a very\\n strong flavor of the gingerbread. Much more powerful than\\xa0anything else we've had today. But I like it... Nicholas Copernicus was born in Toruń in 1473.\\xa0\\xa0 This home now houses a\\xa0museum dedicated to his work. Copernicus had many fields of interest including\\xa0astronomy, mathematics, and economics. Just to name a few. He wrote 'On the Revolutions of the Celestial\\xa0Spheres.' This mathematically explained that the planets, \\nincluding the Earth, orbit around the Sun. And that the Earth rotates daily on its axis. The idea that Toruń is a gingerbread city is not\\xa0a legend. It is very real. We had gingerbread coffee, pastries, and beer.

       " \"handcuff that naomi was kind\\xa0\\nenough to put her head in babushka does your pigeon friend have a name magda\\xa0\\nboth of us hit our heads a little bit\\xa0\\xa0 i've just been whacking my head off\\xa0\\nof things let's break into a church what's up you guys and welcome back to the channel\\xa0\\nlast evening we were kind of trying to see what\\xa0\\xa0 we could possibly shoot a video about today so we\\xa0\\njust kind of went on google to have a look around\\xa0\\xa0 which cities are in close proximity to Łódź and\\xa0\\nwe found one city which is called Łęczyca\\xa0\\xa0 i hope i pronounced that one right because when we\\xa0\\nwere trying to order the tickets for this train\\xa0\\xa0 the lady did not understand where we were trying\\xa0\\nto go but uh i'm pretty sure it's wish it's now apparently in this polish town that we\\xa0\\nare headed to it is slightly north of Łódź\\xa0\\xa0 and there's only apparently around 13 000\\xa0\\ninhabitants in this town so it's definitely\\xa0\\xa0 off the grid it's off the beaten path we thought\\xa0\\ninitially when we went to Łódź that that was off\\xa0\\xa0 the beaten path but now we're going the extra\\xa0\\nmile here and bringing you guys somewhere that\\xa0\\xa0 is really not often visited or shown on youtube\\xa0\\nor by any tourists in general very loud here in\\xa0\\xa0 this train because the window beside us is open\\xa0\\nand the train is already picking up some speed\\xa0\\xa0 as you can probably see this is blowing\\xa0\\ninto front of me here but check this out welcome to Łęczyca we just had a little bit\\xa0\\nof an ordeal getting off the train there\\xa0\\xa0 polish woman very friendly came in and\\xa0\\nstarted asking for help to get off the train\\xa0\\xa0 i understand very we understand very little\\xa0\\npolish but i understood that she needed help\\xa0\\xa0 so we went to try and assist her and she turns out\\xa0\\nshe was very confused he tried to get off on the\\xa0\\xa0 wrong side of the train and was literally going\\xa0\\nout onto the tracks it turned out you had to go\\xa0\\xa0 out the other door it was manual doors to open the\\xa0\\ndoors like you literally have to turn the handles\\xa0\\xa0 just to open the door and give it a good\\xa0\\nstrong push and there's this really weird noise that is coming out of all the speakers here at\\xa0\\nthe train station but yeah welcome to Łęczyca\\xa0\\xa0 um this is a very interesting train\\xa0\\nstation let alone as a first impression of\\xa0\\xa0 this place and as i said very very few people\\xa0\\nare in are inhabiting here are living here\\xa0\\xa0 so it should be an interesting day apparently\\xa0\\nthere is some cool stuff to check out like castles\\xa0\\xa0 and stuff like that so it's definitely definitely\\xa0\\nthings that we typically will go for and we have\\xa0\\xa0 beautiful weather today once again the polish\\xa0\\nsummer is finally here now if you're wondering\\xa0\\xa0 or if you're my if you are wandering around europe\\xa0\\nand you end up getting lost there's two ways that\\xa0\\xa0 you can make sure that you are in a polish town or\\xa0\\npolish city and that is one if there is a Biedronka\\xa0\\xa0 two if there's a Żabka and we just discovered\\xa0\\nBiedronka so we're gonna go and get some snacks now the town of Łęczyca is one of the oldest towns\\xa0\\nin all of poland with it being mentioned for the\\xa0\\xa0 very first time in the 12th century i believe it\\xa0\\nwas 1180 it was mentioned for the very very\\xa0\\xa0 first time and right now we are directly here\\xa0\\nat the royal castle of Łęczyca as you can see\\xa0\\xa0 directly behind me this castle was completely\\xa0\\ndestroyed around 1707 because of the swedish\\xa0\\xa0 occupation here and after that the locals of\\xa0\\nŁęczyca kind of used the gravels and everything the\\xa0\\xa0 ruins that was there as material to build their\\xa0\\nown houses so that castle was completely destroyed\\xa0\\xa0 after a while and everybody was kind of taking\\xa0\\nwhatever they needed in order to build their\\xa0\\xa0 houses and then in 1964 this castle was completely\\xa0\\nbuilt from scratch to resemble the castle that was\\xa0\\xa0 here before this castle is truly magnificent and\\xa0\\nwe luckily managed to get the drone up in the\\xa0\\xa0 air and capture some birds eye shots over the\\xa0\\ncastle itself and over the town and this place\\xa0\\xa0 is actually really very pretty there's plenty\\xa0\\nof red brick architecture going on around here\\xa0\\xa0 and you can tell that a lot has happened in this\\xa0\\nplace throughout history and funnily enough facing\\xa0\\xa0 the castle itself is a Żabka and a Biedronka\\xa0\\nso kind of just proves my point really welcome to\\xa0\\xa0 poland now this castle from the outside is really\\xa0\\nreally beautiful with the red brick exterior and\\xa0\\xa0 to be honest if i wouldn't have read beforehand\\xa0\\nthat it was kind of rebuilt from scratch you\\xa0\\xa0 wouldn't really know that that is the case it kind\\xa0\\nof just looks like you know every other castle and\\xa0\\xa0 that is from the 12th century obviously it has\\xa0\\nits own details and it's very very unique to this\\xa0\\xa0 place but you wouldn't necessarily think that it's\\xa0\\nnot from that time we just after walking into the\\xa0\\xa0 entrance of this castle and we bumped into nigel\\xa0\\nthornberry look-alike i don't know if any of you\\xa0\\xa0 guys watching um our channel are familiar with\\xa0\\nthe thornberry's very famous cartoon from when\\xa0\\xa0 me and naomi or naomi and i were children\\xa0\\nand this is kind of almost like a look-alike\\xa0\\xa0 of nigel thornberry look up the show really\\xa0\\nfunny show just after you walk in the entrance\\xa0\\xa0 of the castle you are greeted by this very cool\\xa0\\nlooking garden there are hundreds of swallows flying just above us right now it's very cool\\xa0\\xa0 and the acoustics in here in the garden kind\\xa0\\nof amplifies those birds but there's plenty\\xa0\\xa0 of things out here in the garden to check out\\xa0\\nlike there's a kind of an old-school handcuff\\xa0\\xa0 that naomi was kind enough to put her head\\xa0\\nin and we are also going to go and check out\\xa0\\xa0 the museum itself it's around 28 złoty per\\xa0\\nperson to go inside and we should be able to\\xa0\\xa0 go up to this cool looking tower as well so let's\\xa0\\ngo and check this museum out and see what's inside Be careful with your head. It was my shoulder. My god, there is no space. check how claustrophobic it is in here for me\\xa0\\nit's all right i'm a little bit on the wide side\\xa0\\xa0 but both of my shoulders are touching either\\xa0\\nof the walls we're going up a tower should be\\xa0\\xa0 interesting fortunately a lot of the signs here\\xa0\\nare in just polish but it's very interesting like good spirits that's what i understood\\xa0\\nlike it because she said it looks like the\\xa0\\xa0 devil like the other yeah but it's\\xa0\\na good one it's not actual devil ah\\xa0\\xa0 yeah yeah that's what i understood squeaky floors this is very cool very unique pronunciation on point you can see the different outfits that\\xa0\\npeople used to wear back in these ages okay so that woman was trying to give us a little\\xa0\\nbit of a lecture as to what what is obviously\\xa0\\xa0 with our very little polish and she wasn't really\\xa0\\nspeaking any english either she spoke a little\\xa0\\xa0 bit of german so she kind of knew good gut\\xa0\\nand zurück and all of these things but she\\xa0\\xa0 didn't knew that much and we obviously don't know\\xa0\\nany polish so it was a little bit difficult but\\xa0\\xa0 they were actually not good spirits i think as\\xa0\\nfar as we understood it was kind of more of a\\xa0\\xa0 situation of sins or something like that like\\xa0\\nthese little devils were behaving obviously like\\xa0\\xa0 a devil and they were like lifting up the skirt\\xa0\\nof the women and acting as if it's the wind or\\xa0\\xa0 kind of touching women in a weird way all of\\xa0\\nthese things so it was not good spirits no\\xa0\\xa0 idea what it actually was though yeah that was\\xa0\\na very interesting interaction with that woman\\xa0\\xa0 we still don't really have much of a\\xa0\\nclue as to what's going on here but\\xa0\\xa0 it's very interesting there's plenty of things to\\xa0\\ncheck out and now we're on our way up to a tower\\xa0\\xa0 which supposedly has some pretty nice views over\\xa0\\nthe garden that we were just standing in there not\\xa0\\xa0 so long ago it's very dark in here but this is one\\xa0\\nsection of the tower and a few spooky images here\\xa0\\xa0 i don't know if you're going to get them on\\xa0\\nthe gopro but hopefully we can capture some\\xa0\\xa0 with other cameras that we brought with us\\xa0\\xa0 the lighting in here is not on our side right now\\xa0\\nguys but check this view out out of this window it's obviously a cage over the window so it's\\xa0\\nnot the best but we have a little bit more\\xa0\\xa0 to scale up to get to the top of this tower\\xa0\\nafter a few of those really really dark\\xa0\\xa0 little staircases we are basically there\\xa0\\nthat's the exit of the tower where we will have\\xa0\\xa0 a nice view i hope the staircase\\xa0\\nis very steep trying to get up here comes the sun here comes the sun and i say who are\\xa0\\nyou talking to you there's a pigeon hello pigeon hello that's pigeon language for get on my finger yeah we made it all the way to the top you can\\xa0\\nsee that's the top of the tower there directly\\xa0\\xa0 behind us and from here you have an amazing view\\xa0\\nall over the city but also a lot of fields wait\\xa0\\xa0 i'm trying to find the best angle to show you\\xa0\\nguys oh yeah now you see how green Poland is when we went up here there was kind\\xa0\\nof still another group down there and\\xa0\\xa0 they were shouting from the tower to the\\xa0\\npeople down there and back and forth like unfortunately they're gone\\xa0\\nnow so we cannot scream woohoo\\xa0\\xa0 i would like to scream yeah that's\\xa0\\ndefinitely something that i wouldn't do but yeah this tower is cool the museum is cool\\xa0\\ndefinitely worth a visit this place is roughly\\xa0\\xa0 around 40-45 minutes are no more like an hour\\xa0\\nor so away from Łódź by train we just took the\\xa0\\xa0 ice train or icc train incredibly cheap\\xa0\\nactually to get out to this random polish town\\xa0\\xa0 cost us twenty zloty twenty slotty for two people\\xa0\\nit was ten złoty per person for the train\\xa0\\xa0 and the museum here was 28 złoty per\\xa0\\nperson yeah so it was more expensive to\\xa0\\xa0 come in here but this place is very much worth\\xa0\\nthe 28 zloty that's i think it's around five\\xa0\\xa0 euro per person to come in here and check this\\xa0\\nplace out this tower view alone by itself is\\xa0\\xa0 worth that money um and the walk up as well\\xa0\\nis pretty unnerving if you are claustrophobic\\xa0\\xa0 beware because it is very narrow and\\xa0\\ntight but if you are afraid of heights\\xa0\\xa0 like i am you will be fine because it is\\xa0\\nclaustrophobic there's no like free fall drops\\xa0\\xa0 or anything like that it's just very very narrow\\xa0\\nsmall it's claustrophobic not highophobic yes\\xa0\\xa0 both of us hit our heads a little bit on\\xa0\\nthe way down so I'm 5'10 or 178\\xa0\\xa0 in the metric system if you're anywhere close to\\xa0\\nthat make sure to protect your head at all costs\\xa0\\xa0 when you walk down that staircase obviously luke\\xa0\\nis a lot taller and i think he hit his head a lot\\xa0\\xa0 more and harder than i did yeah i nearly i\\xa0\\nactually went down the stairs ahead of naomi\\xa0\\xa0 um i literally went head first into one of the\\xa0\\nwalls i don't know if you can see it very well\\xa0\\xa0 because i shaved my head i actually shaved my\\xa0\\nhead while we were in krakow and ever since i've\\xa0\\xa0 shaved my head i've just been whacking my head\\xa0\\noff of things for some weird reason so i have\\xa0\\xa0 loads of bumps and bruises and scars and stuff\\xa0\\nlike that that are just accumulating on my scalp\\xa0\\xa0 but nonetheless that place it was pretty epic\\xa0we're very glad that we took the train\\xa0\\xa0 out here to Łęczyca this place\\xa0is Łęczyca Łęczyca Łęczyca Łęczyca  it's very much off the beaten path and there\\xa0\\nis so few people that are actually living here\\xa0\\xa0 so very much well worth the day trip because it's\\xa0\\nnot somewhere that people typically would think\\xa0\\xa0 of coming to and checking out but that's\\xa0\\nexactly why we come to places like this\\xa0\\xa0 it's actually why we initially came to Łódź\\xa0\\nbecause Łódź was so like so many people were\\xa0\\xa0 just like don't go to Łódź don't go to Łódź\\xa0\\ndon't go to Łódź and we're like okay we're going\\xa0\\xa0 to go to Łódź same thing with Katowice don't go\\xa0\\nthere people were saying and then we went there\\xa0\\xa0 and then when we come to places like this we\\xa0\\njust have this sort of like a nomadic need\\xa0\\xa0 inside of us to continue exploring deeper into\\xa0\\nthese relatively unknown territories and every\\xa0\\xa0 single time that we go off of the beaten path we\\xa0\\nare rewarded with beautiful places and beautiful\\xa0\\xa0 towns such as this one so we just arrived\\xa0\\nat the Rynek or the main market square and\\xa0\\xa0 very little very few people wandering around\\xa0\\nthe market square of Łęczyca very quaint\\xa0\\xa0 in comparison to a lot of the Ryneks that we've\\xa0\\nseen so far obviously because of the small size\\xa0\\xa0 of this place nonetheless very beautiful great\\xa0\\nweather and we are on our way now to a Żabka to\\xa0\\xa0 get some quick refreshments and then on we go\\xa0\\nto explore more of this little town it's hot this town is really something that we didn't\\xa0\\nactually expect when we picked it out randomly\\xa0\\xa0 on google maps and decided to hop\\xa0\\non the train from Łódź to here\\xa0\\xa0 we kind of had this picture of a totally you know\\xa0\\nmiddle of nowhere countryside type of a situation\\xa0\\xa0 but there's actually plenty of stuff going on\\xa0\\nand there is quite a few people buzzing around\\xa0\\xa0 we walked past in the Rynek there the main square\\xa0\\nwe walked past a couple of cafes and there was\\xa0\\xa0 plenty of people out there just enjoying a\\xa0\\nnice cup of coffee on the friday afternoon\\xa0\\xa0 having some ice cream and stuff like that\\xa0\\nbecause the weather is truly amazing and tomorrow\\xa0\\xa0 believe it or not we are headed to a totally new\\xa0\\nplace that is just north of where we are in Łódź\\xa0\\xa0 we're very very excited if you have\\xa0\\nwatched this far and if you appreciate\\xa0\\xa0 what we do we kindly ask you to hit\\xa0\\nthat red subscribe button because we are\\xa0\\xa0 trying to grow ourselves all the way as far as we\\xa0\\ncan and build ourselves a nice polish audience so\\xa0\\xa0 on to the next stop here and this church\\xa0\\nlooks absolutely stunning check it out so our next stop here is the\\xa0\\nchurch of saint andrew the apostle\\xa0\\xa0 we want to go inside as well to check it out\\xa0\\nbut i will have to put on a jacket because\\xa0\\xa0 usually they don't like it\\xa0\\nas much in poland if you wear\\xa0\\xa0 just like a dress you show your shoulders or a\\xa0\\nhat so if you ever go inside of a church make sure\\xa0\\xa0 to bring something to cover yourself up\\xa0\\nand if you're a man try not to wear a hat looks like it's closed maybe there's another\\xa0\\nentrance but the main entrance seems to be locked didn't have any luck we're getting into this one\\xa0\\nbut as naomi said yeah hopefully there is another\\xa0\\xa0 way of getting into this church because there's no\\xa0\\nbetter way of discovering a new town or a new city\\xa0\\xa0 than going and checking out the church\\xa0\\nor any church that is in the area because\\xa0\\xa0 it's a very quick way of learning\\xa0\\nthe history and traditions\\xa0\\xa0 of the culture in the town or city that you're\\xa0\\nvisiting so that's what we're trying to do\\xa0\\xa0 we're going to try and get in here but\\xa0\\nright now it doesn't look too promising i think we've made it inside i'm not sure are we sneaking into a church it's\\xa0\\nokay to go in or no yeah no ah okay unfortunately not today we're not\\xa0\\ngoing to be checking out this church\\xa0\\xa0 but um the canon or priest or pastor i'm not sure\\xa0\\nwhat his rank was but he kindly let us know that\\xa0\\xa0 the church is closed didn't really understand\\xa0\\nwhat exactly the reason the reasoning was\\xa0\\xa0 but unfortunately the church is closed we almost\\xa0\\nwent in the fire exit i think in the back of the\\xa0\\xa0 church let's break into a church what a what\\xa0\\na way to get into a whole bunch of trouble\\xa0\\xa0 we've only been in this town now for\\xa0\\naround two hours or so and we're already\\xa0\\xa0 getting ourselves into a whole bunch of trouble\\xa0\\nnonetheless the church from the outside is\\xa0\\xa0 absolutely beautiful it's very unique looking and\\xa0\\nit is something that kind of characterizes a lot\\xa0\\xa0 of poland poland and historically is a very strong\\xa0\\ncatholic belief system all throughout the ages\\xa0\\xa0 poland has been rooted historically in catholic\\xa0\\nbeliefs similar as my home country of ireland\\xa0\\xa0 i'm from ireland myself naomi is half german\\xa0\\nhalf italian so very catholic it is just the\\xa0\\xa0 religion of choice but unfortunately today we're\\xa0\\nnot going to experience that side of Łęczyca\\xa0\\xa0 i was however able to at least capture through\\xa0\\nthe entrance door there is a little bit of glass\\xa0\\xa0 on the entrance door what the church looks like\\xa0\\nfrom the inside and it looks very very cool so\\xa0\\xa0 if you are ever here in this beautiful village\\xa0\\nand you get the chance to see the church from\\xa0\\xa0 the inside definitely try and do it because\\xa0\\nit looks absolutely stunning i think generally\\xa0\\xa0 here in this village it's probably not super\\xa0\\ncommon to have tourists visited so a lot of\\xa0\\xa0 people are genuinely curious anyway as to\\xa0\\nwho we are and what we're doing here and\\xa0\\xa0 why we don't speak polish but right\\xa0\\nnow luke is flying the drone there\\xa0\\xa0 just behind me here and there are a lot of people\\xa0\\nthat are very confused as to why there is a drone\\xa0\\xa0 in the Rynek or the market square here or Rynek\\xa0\\ni actually don't know how to pronounce that\\xa0\\xa0 but a lot of people are very very curious and\\xa0\\nyou see kind of everybody is looking like what\\xa0\\xa0 is happening why is there a drone um but we\\xa0\\nhave some really cool drone shots for you\\xa0\\xa0 let's go now in the center itself it really feels\\xa0\\nlike the village kind of is organically grown\\xa0\\xa0 nice little idyllic village and then\\xa0\\nwhen you get closer to the train station\\xa0\\xa0 you have all of these large buildings that kind\\xa0\\nof look like they were built somewhere in between\\xa0\\xa0 1970s and probably the early 2000s obviously\\xa0\\nthey're accommodating a lot more people than the\\xa0\\xa0 little one family type of homes that you can\\xa0\\nsee in the market square unfortunately this is\\xa0\\xa0 directly at the train station so if you do arrive\\xa0\\nas a tourist your first reaction is a little bit\\xa0\\xa0 like oh okay where am i but all of these areas\\xa0\\nnevertheless seem very safe and very idyllic and\\xa0\\xa0 nice so it's all right the not so glamorous\\xa0\\nlife of travel vloggers we decided to make our\\xa0\\xa0 way back to the train station and try and catch\\xa0\\nthe train which we planned on getting back to\\xa0\\xa0Łódź but we missed it we were kind of too focused a\\xa0\\nlittle bit on capturing this town and trying to\\xa0\\xa0 get across to you just how undiscovered\\xa0\\nso many different places are in poland\\xa0\\xa0 and unfortunately we spent a little bit too long\\xa0\\nwe ended up running back here to this station and\\xa0\\xa0 we missed the train by literally around two or\\xa0\\nthree minutes and because of the fact that we are\\xa0\\xa0 very far away from a lot of the main cities in\\xa0\\npoland there's not much connectivity going on here\\xa0\\xa0 the next train is in roughly around two and\\xa0\\na half hours so we're gonna be sitting here\\xa0\\xa0 in the shade trying to stay out of the sun because\\xa0\\ni think i'm a little bit sunburnt but nonetheless\\xa0\\xa0 very productive very good day great place\\xa0\\ndefinitely somewhere that you guys need to\\xa0\\xa0 come and check out we will be waiting here for a\\xa0\\nwhile and then we're gonna jump on this train stay\\xa0\\xa0 with us all the way until the end because we do\\xa0\\nhave a little bit more to chat about on the train still waiting all right guys so it has been around\\xa0\\nthree and a half hours since the last time\\xa0\\xa0 that i spoke to you guys or we spoke to you guys\\xa0\\nand the time that our train was supposed to come\\xa0\\xa0 has passed it's actually around half an\\xa0\\nhour after our train is supposed to come\\xa0\\xa0 and there is still no sign of a train we are\\xa0\\njust sitting here in the sun kind of baking away\\xa0\\xa0 i went up and asked someone if they spoke\\xa0\\nenglish unfortunately they didn't but i\\xa0\\xa0 tried to use google translate just to see if\\xa0\\nthey had any information about getting back\\xa0\\xa0 to Łódź and if there would be a train soon but\\xa0\\nunfortunately no sign so we are currently stranded\\xa0\\xa0 in this little town outside of Łódź\\xa0\\nright now fingers crossed that we get\\xa0\\xa0 a train back to this place because tomorrow we\\xa0\\nare supposed to be checking out of our airbnb\\xa0\\xa0

       " \"Under the cover of darkness on September 7th,\\n1512, near the village of Pashino, deep in Muscovite territory, a group of Poles were building\\npontoon bridges on the Dnieper in order to cross the river. Next to them, smaller groups of light cavalry swam\\nacross and proceeded to dry their clothes and armour. Infantrymen floated on rafts to reach the\\nleft bank of the river, while the main part of the Polish-Lithuanian army waited for the\\nconstruction of the bridges to be completed. Once the engineers completed the job, parts\\nof the infantry started to cross the bridge, followed by cannons and heavy cavalry. But… unable to carry the weight, one of\\nthe bridges collapsed. Despite these difficulties, by early morning\\nthe Polish-Lithuanian army, totalling 30,000 men, was ready to move east to recapture the\\nimportant Lithuanian fortress of Smolensk. But… in front of them stood the Muscovite\\narmy, twice as big, and deployed in battle formation. The  Grand  Duchy of Lithuania united with Poland in 1386,\\nunder the rule of the Jagiellon dynasty. This powerful new state was comprised of Polish,\\nLithuanian, and Ruthenian lands, as well as territories conquered in the East by the Lithuanian\\ndukes over the course of the fourteenth century. This expansion, however, clashed with the\\nambitions of a new emerging power in Eastern Europe. The Muscovite princes had finally thrown off\\nthe Mongol yoke, which lasted for nearly TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY years. It was now time to look outwards. Their objective was to unite all lands populated\\nby the Ruthenian- and Russian-speaking peoples, but this would have to come at the expense\\nof Lithuania. And, during the rule of the Grand Prince Vasili\\nIII, Moscow’s western expansion pushed the border to the Dnieper river. This drastic shift in the balance of power\\nconvinced the King of Poland, Sigismund I, who had until now largely stayed out of any\\nconflicts in the East, to intervene. But Sigismund faced a problem. During the early 16th century, the kingdom’s\\nGeneral Parliament grew into a powerful political institution, becoming one of the primary elements\\nof democratic governance in the Polish dominion. This limited the power of the Crown. Without Parliament approval, the King could\\nno longer unilaterally pass new laws, nor freely use the kingdom’s annual tax income\\nfor military spending. In effect, Sigismund was not able to wield\\nthe same power his predecessors once could. Complicating matters further, in 1512, Albert\\nof Prussia became the new Grand Master of the Teutonic Order and had refused to acknowledge\\nPoland’s suzerainty, thus breaking an oath of fealty to the Polish King. Worse, to alleviate pressure on Lithuania,\\nSigismund plotted with the Crimean Khan to attack the Grand Duchy of Moscow from the\\nsouth – a plot that Vasili’s spies had uncovered. Pretext in hand, the Grand Prince was not\\nabout to pass up on the opportunity to take advantage of the changing political dynamics\\nin Poland to continue Moscow’s territorial expansion. He tasked the Boyar Ivan Andreyevich Chelyadnin\\nwith supervising the campaign to take the strategically vital city of Smolensk. This city was of huge strategic importance\\nfor Vasili, because to attack Moscow, any hostile army that was located further west\\nwould have to pass right through Smolensk. Worse, while in enemy hands, this well-fortified\\ncity also threatened the military endeavours of the Russians, so the one who controlled\\nit held a very favorable strategic position. At the time of this attack, the Muscovites\\nalso tried to attack Polotsk, but this was unsuccessful, so these forces were diverted\\ntowards the siege of Smolensk. In the meantime, a little further south, the\\nGrand Hetman of Lithuania Konstanty Ostrogski invaded Moscow’s territory and inflicted\\nheavy defeats on the Muscovite army in the region of Severia in several smaller battles. Here he defeated about 6000 Russians. But with the small number of troops at his\\ndisposal, he could not oppose the main army of Vasili III that besieged Smolensk. A six- and four-week siege followed in 1513,\\nboth unsuccessful, but the Muscovite forces succeeded in taking the city in July 1514,\\ndealing a serious blow to Lithuania. Encouraged by their success, the Russians\\nconquered several smaller fortresses in the surrounding area and despite their large army,\\nthey decided to stop there. After the fall of the most important Lithuanian\\nfortress on the eastern border, the focus of the Polish parliament and nobility was\\nfinally directed towards the war with the Grand Duchy of Moscow. After long preparations during the summer\\nof 1514, the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania gathered around 35,000 soldiers\\nunder his command. The soldiers primarily came from Poland and\\nLithuania and were mostly horsemen, but certain mercenary contingents also joined the campaign,\\nalong with volunteer detachments from Bohemia. Most importantly, large numbers of artillery\\npieces were gathered to help recapture the lost fortress of Smolensk. From Vilnius, the Polish-Lithuanian army moved\\nsouth-east and stopped at Minsk to unite with units arriving from all over the country. After Minsk, Sigismund continued towards the\\neastern border to confront the Muscovites. Soon he reached the city of Borisov, a key\\ncrossing over the imposing Berezina river. There, he handed over command of the majority\\nof the army to Hetman Konstanty Ostrogski, while he remained in this position with about\\n5,000 men. Ostrogski continued with the main army towards\\nthe Dnieper River, which he had to cross in order to recapture city of Smolensk. Meanwhile, Ivan Chelyadnin, having learned\\nabout the movement of the enemy, had gathered the scattered Muscovite troops and decided\\nto confront the Polish-Lithuanian Army. However, his scouts reported that Ostrogski\\nhad a fairly large host under his command, so Chelyadnin decided to receive the battle\\nin a more favourable position. He retreated from Drutsk even further east\\nwhile slowing down the enemy's advance with smaller detachments. Then he crossed the Dnieper River and developed\\nhis battle positions to meet the enemy. The town of Orsha was a suitable river crossing\\ndue to the existence of two bridges in close proximity, which allowed for a quick transfer\\nof troops. This was precisely what the Russian commanders\\ncounted on, because the Polish-Lithuanian army had to first cross the Dnieper, before\\nthey could continue towards Smolensk. Indeed, on September 6, 1514, Hetman Ostrogski\\narrived near Orsha. There he halted his army to reconnoitre the\\nterrain and prepare his army for the crossing. Although the army of the Grand Duchy of Moscow\\nwas larger, Ivan Chelyadnin wanted to avoid a risky encounter. Instead, he patiently waited and observed\\nthe enemy, planning to attack while they were still developing their battle formations. Chelyadnin's army was predominantly composed\\nof cavalry, but its’ size is difficult to estimate. Some sources claim that it numbered as many\\nas 80,000 men. While the Muscovites definitely had a numerical\\nadvantage, the actual size of their army was much smaller, with the range between 40,000\\nand 60,000 troops being more likely. The Muscovites waited for two days for the\\nPolish-Lithuanian army to make the first move. But what they failed to realise was that only\\na portion of the enemy army was present. Ostrogski anticipated that Chelyadnin would\\ncontest the crossing, so he spread out smaller units of Lithuanian cavalry across a wide\\narea and had ordered the men to set up additional tents, light numerous camp fires, and make\\na lot of noise, to create the illusion that the entire Polish-Lithuanian army was at Orsha. The ruse worked. While the Muscovites expected to contest the\\ncrossing at Orsha, some 5 kilometres (just over 3 miles) northeast, Ostrogski had two\\npontoon bridges constructed and moved the majority of his army across the river, during\\nthe night. When Chelyadnin finally learned of the movements,\\nhe rushed towards Pashino, but by then the Polish-Lithuanian army had already crossed. Ostrogski forces found themselves on a plain\\ncut by a ravine with the river behind them. Not far in front of them, a more numerous\\narmy of Muscovites took up position. Both sides realized that a pitched battle\\nwas upon them. Muscovites were composed of five large cavalry\\nregiments. The most numerous was under the command of\\nChelyadnin, in the center. In front of it was a smaller vanguard contingent. Stationed on each side were cavalry regiments. The reserves were positioned in the rear. The Muscovite army numbered between 40,000\\nand 60,000 troops. The Polish-Lithuanian Army formed in its classic\\nformation, The Old Polish Order. On the right, Sampoliński commanded the first\\nPolish line, comprised mostly of better equipped and heavy cavalry, while Świerczowski led\\nthe second and third. On the left, Ostrogski took charge of the\\nLithuanians in the front, with the second and third line commanded by Jerzy Radziwiłł. All told, some 30,000 Polish-Lithuanian troops\\ntook to the field. Around 2 PM, Ivan Chelyadnin ordered his army\\nto attack. The Muscovite plan was to use the terrain,\\nespecially the ravines and various bushes, in order to surprise the enemy, but their\\nmovements were spotted in time. The Muscovite vanguard took part in this attack, as well as\\nthe right wing under the command of Mikhail Golitsa. As the Russian vanguard was spotted, it was attacked by\\nLithuanian auxiliary troops with a hail of arrows. Muscovites responded with arrows volleys of\\ntheir own and a fierce battle began between Lithuanian and Russian archers. In the meantime, Ostrogski saw that the biggest\\nthreat to his army was the Russian right wing, which tried to sneak up and attack the Lithuanian\\nleft flank. In order to eliminate this danger, he could\\nrush towards the enemy and stop him; BUT since he mostly had light cavalry under his command,\\nit was questionable whether they would be able to stop the more numerous Muscovite right\\nwing. His lightly armoured cavalry would be especially\\nexposed to enemy’s arrows, and in case of a defeat on the left wing, he could lose control\\nover the pontoon bridges he had built earlier, which would lead to a catastrophic situation. Because of this, he ordered Sampoliński to\\nattack these enemy units so that instead of the light Lithuanian, the enemy would face\\nthe heavy Polish cavalry. The Polish horsemen rode straight through\\nthe arrow volleys exchanged by the Lithuanian auxiliaries and the Russian vanguard, and\\nhaving suffered minimal losses they crashed into Mikhail Golitsa's flank. The momentum of the Polish charge caused chaos\\nin the Russian ranks, leading to panic and confusion. Responding quickly, Chelyadnin ordered his\\nleft wing forward. Wanting to break the enemy line, he focused\\nthe attack was the now weakened Polish right wing. Outnumbered 3:1 on this part of the front,\\nthe Polish hussars and light cavalry managed to hold off the more numerous opponent with\\nfierce charges, followed by quick retreats. However, Chelyadnin still hadn’t committed\\nhis center. He watched the fight on the wings and sent\\nreinforcements when needed. Thus, seeing the difficult situation on his\\nright wing, he sent parts of his vanguard to their aid, aiming to attack the Polish\\nheavy cavalry from the rear. The Muscovite commander waited for the moment\\nwhen the enemy forces would get stretched thin, before launching an overwhelming attack\\non the Polish-Lithuanian center. His main goal was to capture the bridge and\\nprevent Ostrogski from retreating across the river. The Polish heavy cavalry, although initially\\nsuccessful in inflicting heavy losses on the enemy, now found themselves pressed from two\\nsides. Step by step their attack waned until they\\nfinally went on the defensive. In the meantime, Ostrogski rushed with his\\nunits to help the embattled Polish heavy cavalry, which was in a difficult situation. On the left wing, the Muscovites managed to\\nsuppress the outnumbered Polish right. The Poles gradually retreated and it seemed\\nthat it was only a matter of time before they would break and retreat towards the bridge\\nen masse. Chelyadnin’s plan succeeded. Ostrogski overstretched his lines, sending\\nmany of his troops to bolster the wings. Now, the Muscovite commander ordered the center\\nforward. They advanced steadily towards the fairly\\nweakened Polish center. But, personally leading from the front, Hetman\\nOstrogski raised the morale of the men and pushed back on the left. Mikhail Golitsa's units began a slow retreat\\ntowards the Dnieper River, suffering heavy losses. At the same time on the right, the Polish\\ninfantry, equipped with guns and pikes, arrived at their positions. They attacked the flank of the Muscovite left\\nwing from the forest, while the Polish cavalry, after a successfully performed feigned retreat,\\nstarted a counterattack. Surprised by close infantry and artillery\\nfire and the renewed hussar attack, Chelyadnin's left wing suffered terribly. A Many Muscovite officers fell, and panic\\nspread throughout the entire left wing. In the meantime, the Muscovite center finally\\ncollided with the weakened Polish-Lithuanian center. However, the battles on the wings were by\\nnow already decided. Ostrogski rallied his Lithuanians and now\\ncharged into the center while leaving Sampoliński and his heavy Polish cavalry to chase the\\nRussian right wing. Around this time, the Muscovite left wing\\nfled the field, followed by the Polish right. But the bloodiest phase of the battle began\\nwhen the last reserves of Poles and Lithuanians joined in the attack on Chelyadnin's center\\nand rearguard. The Muscovites put up a stiff resistance,\\nbut after a long fight and immense casualties, they eventually broke and fled. The pursuit lasted until sunset. Russian losses were enormous, with at least 13,000 perishing\\nduring the battle and another 5,000 captured. On the other hand, the Poles reported only\\n500 dead, a quite unrealistic claim. Given the ferocity of the fighting, it is\\nlikely that the losses went into the thousands. Nevertheless, the Polish-Lithuanian army inflicted\\na crushing defeat on the Muscovites at Orsha. After the battle, the Polish-Lithuanian Army managed\\nto regain control over some of their lost fortresses. However, the well-fortified and well-supplied\\nSmolensk required a months-long siege. Grand Duke Vasili III could not allow this\\nimportant fortress to fall into enemy hands again, and he did everything necessary to\\nkeep it. Despite failing to recapture Smolensk, news\\nof the Polish-Lithuanian victory in the Battle of Orsha spread across Europe. After defeating the Grand Duchy of Moscow,\\nthe Holy Roman Empire and other states decided to moderate their policy towards the Kingdom\\nof Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. However, the wars in the east continued. Vasili tried to avoid an open battle for some\\ntime, but already in 1518 a new army was raised and the offensive was renewed to conquer another\\nstrategic Lithuanian fortress… Polotsk.\",\n",

       " \"what's up you guys and welcome back to the channel\\xa0\\ntoday we made our way out of krakow to Wieliczka\\xa0\\xa0 because we were told that there is a stop here\\xa0\\nthat you cannot miss if you ever visit krakow\\xa0\\xa0 the Wieliczka salt mines so let's go on a\\xa0\\ntour and explore this beautiful area together\\xa0\\xa0 so that you can hear me well my name is Alexandra\\xa0\\nI'll be your guide today ladies and gentlemen I hope that you're all wearing comfortable shoes\\xa0\\nas we're having three kilometers of walking ahead\\xa0\\xa0 of us and more or less 800 steps we will stay\\xa0\\nwith 320 to get to the first level of the mine\\xa0\\xa0 then 450 more ahead of us the temperature\\xa0\\ninside is around 17 degrees celsius so it will\\xa0\\xa0 be very pleasant downstairs are you sure you're\\xa0\\nready yes perfect we are making our way into\\xa0\\xa0 the mine now and the lady said that it's more\\xa0\\nthan 300 steps just to get down and then within\\xa0\\xa0 the mine itself we're going to walk around three\\xa0\\nkilometers so definitely make sure to bring your\\xa0\\xa0 comfort shoes comfortable shoes the comfort shoes\\xa0\\nas Naomi was saying 300 steps around 64 meters\\xa0\\xa0 down and I definitely didn't bring my\\xa0\\ncomfortable shoes i'm wearing a pair of Docs\\xa0\\xa0 so we'll see if I get through this um well you\\xa0\\ncan already feel the air getting a little bit\\xa0\\xa0 on the colder side but it's supposed to be pretty\\xa0\\npleasant down there around 16 degrees celsius so\\xa0\\xa0 we'll see please pray with me I hope we don't\\xa0\\nhave to walk these stairs back up walking up\\xa0\\xa0 more than 300 stairs or steps would probably\\xa0\\nbe exhausting so we're a few minutes in now\\xa0\\xa0 and it really does feel like it's not\\xa0\\nstopping just down another floor 36\\xa0\\xa0 meters down already and we have about another\\xa0\\n30 to go you can already start seeing the salt\\xa0\\xa0 all over the walls and I kind of are you one of\\xa0\\nthese people as well that just kind of want to\\xa0\\xa0 touch everything you see so yes definitely not\\xa0\\na place for anybody that's over six feet tall\\xa0\\xa0 and gotta keep a low profile here guys it's\\xa0\\ninteresting they have ventilation rooms here just\\xa0\\xa0 to keep the temperature at an average base of 17\\xa0\\ndegrees year round so and we just went through one\\xa0\\xa0 so very very interesting beautiful place the\\xa0\\n20th century but here you can see Daniłowiszka Shaft which was build in the 17th century\\xa0\\nand actually until the very beginning of\\xa0\\xa0 actually the very end of 2021 we were using this\\xa0\\nshaft to enter the mine in total there were 26\\xa0\\xa0 mainshafts like Daniłowiszka Shaft, which were connecting deeper\\xa0\\nsections of the mine with the surface and 184\\xa0\\xa0 shafts connecting different levels of the mine in\\xa0\\na moment I'll show you one of them called Antonia\\xa0\\xa0 wow so we were just in a vault there and the floor\\xa0\\nitself even was made of salt and there was an\\xa0\\xa0 incredible salt sculpture in there too 40 million\\xa0\\ntourists have visited the salt mine to date\\xa0\\xa0 as well mind-blowing as I have already mentioned\\xa0\\nwe are now on the first level of the mine 64\\xa0\\xa0 meters below the surface but the maximum debt that\\xa0\\nwe are going to reach today is do you remember 120\\xa0\\xa0 135 ladies and gentlemen as you have already\\xa0\\nnoticed there is plenty of wood here we can\\xa0\\xa0 see that our mine is actually a combination of\\xa0\\nwood and salt and actually all of these wooden\\xa0\\xa0 constructions they are all made of coniferous wood\\xa0\\nbecause this type of wood becomes as tough as rock\\xa0\\xa0 under the influence of salt and it fits perfectly\\xa0\\nin the mine to secure our constructions the air\\xa0\\xa0 down here because of its properties and being so\\xa0\\nrich in salt is supposed to be really really good\\xa0\\xa0 if you have asthma or allergies so I have both\\xa0\\nof them that's absolutely perfect for me but it\\xa0\\xa0 is certainly a different type of air being down\\xa0\\nthis low on the ground certainly hits different\\xa0\\xa0 the air is very very different you feel a little\\xa0\\nbit dizzy and ceiling's here pretty low as well\\xa0\\xa0 so I'm gonna have a sore back so apparently\\xa0\\na massive flood took place in the early 90's\\xa0\\xa0 and not only did it float the entire mine it also\\xa0\\nfloated the entire town of Wieliczka wow the tour\\xa0\\xa0 guide just said there that you can actually fit\\xa0\\nthe entire eiffel tower into this mine and still\\xa0\\xa0 have three meters to spare that image is a bit\\xa0\\nbizarre but definitely super interesting very\\xa0\\xa0 interesting to mention is that the miners had\\xa0\\nto participate in a mass twice a day once in the\\xa0\\xa0 morning and once in the afternoon and if they\\xa0\\ndidn't participate for example in the morning\\xa0\\xa0 that meant really bad luck and also they were\\xa0\\nnot allowed to actually enter the mine that day\\xa0\\xa0 so if you had a bad morning and slept in maybe\\xa0\\ndidn't get out of bed because of too much vodka\\xa0\\xa0 the night before and that meant no work for you\\xa0\\nthat day we are now entering saint kingas chapel\\xa0\\xa0 which was built by three miners two brothers\\xa0\\nand another one that finished it afterwards\\xa0\\xa0 and every single sunday there's still mass\\xa0\\nhappening here at 7 30 a.m and you can even rent\\xa0\\xa0 this place in case you would like to get married\\xa0\\nhere and she said it costs between three to four\\xa0\\xa0 thousand euro just to rent this place here\\xa0\\nfor your wedding ceremony but oh my god\\xa0\\xa0 that would be such a beautiful wedding\\xa0\\nand I would love to get married here\\xa0\\xa0 down here in the chapel this place really is\\xa0\\nabsolutely mind-blowing I just cannot believe\\xa0\\xa0 the stuff that I'm looking at right now the\\xa0\\nsculptures on the walls the beautiful chandeliers\\xa0\\xa0 everything even the floor is made of salt it's\\xa0\\njust out of this world it's so unique and unesco\\xa0\\xa0 world heritage site as well so it really really\\xa0\\nreally just blows your mind just walking around\\xa0\\xa0 here and it's around 100 meters deep right now as\\xa0\\nwell so my legs are feeling very very wobbly and I don't really know if I'm gonna make it all the way\\xa0\\nno jokes will be fine but this place is stunning\\xa0\\xa0 what I personally think is so absolutely stunning\\xa0\\nabout this chapel here is that it was built with\\xa0\\xa0 several different types of salt so the gray salt\\xa0\\nthat you can see everywhere on the floors and the\\xa0\\xa0 walls that is the local salt here but in order to\\xa0\\nset some accents they actually imported salt from\\xa0\\xa0 other mines just to kind of give it this like\\xa0\\nglowing type of image and we actually saw\\xa0\\xa0 one statue of baby jesus where everything around\\xa0\\nit is kind of in the gray salt and then baby jesus\\xa0\\xa0 itself is or himself is in a pinky type of salt\\xa0\\nor for example that some accents were set with\\xa0\\xa0 a white salt and where you know the heart is kind\\xa0\\nof illuminated off the saint and that's absolutely\\xa0\\xa0 beautiful that was really really stunning\\xa0\\nbeautiful underground lake over 100 meters\\xa0\\xa0 down and it's apparently impossible to drown in\\xa0\\nbecause of the salt content in there and it's\\xa0\\xa0 apparently freezing cold as well so won't be gone\\xa0\\nfor a swim incredible so apparently even up to\\xa0\\xa0 this day there's around 200 miners that are still\\xa0\\nworking in these salt mines around 500 tour guides\\xa0\\xa0 in all different types of languages and they\\xa0\\napparently host up to 10 000 visitors a day wow the last chamber of our tour here is 36 meters\\xa0\\nhigh and it's called the Stanisłav Staszic\\xa0\\xa0 chamber I hope I pronounced that one right\\xa0\\nit's actually a chamber where a lot of events\\xa0\\xa0 are happening such as bungee jumping because\\xa0\\nit's quite high I hope you can see it up there\\xa0\\xa0 and somebody flew an air balloon in here which\\xa0\\nwas the first underground air balloon journey\\xa0\\xa0 and we're just absolutely mad I would love to\\xa0\\ndefinitely be part of one of these events one day okay so first things first I would like to thank\\xa0\\nour tour guide Alexandra she did an amazing tour\\xa0\\xa0 and she's just cute as a button so if you\\xa0\\never come here and get Alexandra you can be\\xa0\\xa0 lucky yeah she was an amazing tour guide yeah tour\\xa0\\nitself was absolutely fantastic we enjoyed every\\xa0\\xa0 single second of it and seeing just how far down\\xa0\\nthose mines go it really really blew our minds\\xa0\\xa0 just understanding the pure size of it she said\\xa0\\nat one point we were around 130 meters down and\\xa0\\xa0 she said we've only seen around one percent of the\\xa0\\nmine itself and that we would take probably around\\xa0\\xa0 one month in total to see the entire mine so it\\xa0\\ngives you an idea of the scale of that place so\\xa0\\xa0 the entire mine is approximately 230 kilometers\\xa0\\nlong like underground from what I understood\\xa0\\xa0 and we maybe saw like three kilometers\\xa0\\ntoday or something like that so\\xa0\\xa0 there's a lot a lot more to see and but I do think\\xa0\\nthe majority of it is not open to the public yeah\\xa0\\xa0 absolutely and we are now just taking some time\\xa0\\nto decompress the town that these mines are in\\xa0\\xa0 is absolutely stunning as well the Wieliczka salt\\xa0\\nmines 100% worth going to we've been told that if\\xa0\\xa0 you come to krakow you cannot come here and miss\\xa0\\nout on these mines and we 100% after seeing those\\xa0\\xa0 we agree well well worth a visit and definitely\\xa0\\ncome here and check them out as soon as you can\\xa0\\xa0 I couldn't agree more but that's it from us today\\xa0\\nyou guys we are the two mad explorers and this\\xa0\\xa0 is your reminder to keep exploring thanks for\\xa0\\nwatching see you in the next video guys bye-bye\",\n",

DAVE CAMPBELL TALKED ABOUT THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS AND ALL THE EFFORTS TO HELP. >> WITH MILLIONS OF REFUGEES CROSSING THE BORDER INTO POLAND, U.S. AMBASSADOR, MARK BRZEZINSKI, ONLY APPOINTED THIS PAST DECEMBER IS NOW AT THE CENTER OF THE WORST HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN THE PAST FEW DECADES. >> IN THE LAST TEN WEEKS WE HAVE HAD ALMOST 100 MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND WE HAVE HAD THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND SECRETARY OF STATE TWICE AND SECRETARY OF DEFENSE TWICE, AND THIS CRISIS IS NOT JUST A POLISH PROBLEM, IT'S AN INTERNATIONAL PROBLEM AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE AMERICANS TO JOIN IN AND SHARE IN SOLVING THIS PROBLEM AND FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD TO DO SO AS WELL. >> NOT ONLY HAS MARK MET WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS BUT WITH PRIVATE SECTOR COMPANIES TO CONTRIBUTE TO AID LIKE UBER. >> THEY WERE THE FIRST COMPANY THROUGH THE DOOR WHEN THE CRISIS BROKE OUT ON FEBRUARY 24th, AND THEY SAID WE ARE SEEING THE PEOPLE COMING TO THE BORDER, AND HOW CAN UBER JUMP IN BY MAKING FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND PROVIDING RIDES, AND THEY HAVE SAVED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. >> AMBASSADOR BRZEZINSKI AND I SPOKE ABOUT THE RESOURCES AFTER THE LONG JOURNEY OF THE DISPLACED UKRAINIANS. >> THEY HAVE BEEN ON THEIR WAY FOR THREE TO FOUR DAYS. MANY OF THEM DID NOT HAVE PROPER FOOD, AND SOME OF THEM ARE COMING WITH TWO BAGS, THAT'S ALL THEY COULD TAKE, AND THEY HAVE TO LAY ON THE FLOOR OF THE CARRIAGE BECAUSE OF THE SHELLING. >> HOW DO YOU TAKE CARE OF THEIR NEEDS WHEN THE REFUGEES ARRIVE HERE? >> WE ARE LOOKING AT BASIC HEALTH CARE. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ON THE ROAD FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS, AND PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK, THEY SELDOM CAN -- WE ARE LOOKING AT A LOT OF MEDICAL EVACUATIONS FROM A CITY IN UKRAINE. >> THIS BOY IS A REFUGEE AND IS VOLUNTEERING FOR HIS FELLOW UKRAINIANS. >> I HAVE UKRAINIANS WHO ALSO MANAGED TO MOVE TO POLAND FROM UKRAINE BECAUSE OF WAR. >> DID YOU LEAVE SOME FAMILY BEHIND WHEN YOU CAME HERE? >> YEAH, MY FAMILY IN UKRAINE\\nNOW. >> JOANNA FROM THE NORWEGIAN COUNCIL IS ASSISTING MILLIONS OF UKRAINIANS. >> WE NEED TO REMEMBER FUNDING IS DRYING UP AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO REPLENISH IT, AND THERE ARE MASSIVE CONCERNS THAT WITH THE NEW WAVE OF DISPLACEMENT, THE PEOPLE ARRIVING ARE GOING TO BE MORE VULNERABLE AND IT'S SHOCKING AND EMOTIONALLY CHALLENGING TO BE HERE IN MY OWN COUNTRY HELPING PEOPLE FLEE FROM\\nWAR, JUST LIKE MY GRANDPARENTS WAR, JUST LIKE MY GRANDPARENTS WERE FLEEING WAR. >> EIGHT DECADES LATER NEXT DOOR TO WE'RE WITNESSING THE HORRORS OF UNJUST BRUTALITY AND AGAINST INNOCENT PEOPLE WHO WANT TO LIVE PEACEFULLY. IN 2022, THE ENTIRE WORLD SEES THE SUFFERING OF MILLIONS OF UKRAINIANS, BUT WE ALL ALSO ALL OF POLAND CHOOSING ACTION. >> TODAY WHEN THE SOCIETY AND THE GOVERNMENT, THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE HELPING MILLIONS OF UKRAINIANS WHO COME TO POLAND, I THINK THAT THERE IS A CERTAIN SILVER LINING TO THAT CLOUD, BECAUSE MAYBE SOME PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY DRAWING LESSONS FROM THE PAST. >> AMBASSADOR BRZEZINSKI VISITING TWO SUCH ORGANIZATIONS TAKING ACTION. THE SLK FOUNDATION AND LITTLE CHEF WHO PARTNERED TO COOK FOOD FOR REFUGEES. >> SO EVERY TWO WEEKS WE HAVE REFUGEES REFUGEES COOKING FOR REFUGEES. AS OF THE SECOND DAY OF THE WAR, WE'VE BEEN COOKING AND HELPING DISTRIBUTE FOOD. >> HOW ARE YOU SUPPORTED? >> WE ARE TAKING DONATIONS BECAUSE OUR GOAL IS IT WORK LONG-TERM. THIS IS A SITUATION THAT WILL NOT GO AWAY. AND IT IS NOT A SPRINT. IT IS A MARATHON. >> THE POLISH PEOPLE ARE STEPPING UP FOR PEOPLE LIKE UKRAINE IN PLACES LIKE THIS, IN KITCHENS, IN APARTMENT BUILDINGS AND BIG CITIES AND LITTLE TOWNS, THEY'RE INVITING UKRAINIANS INTO THEIR HOMES AND IT IS A NATIONAL POLICY TO BRING THEM INTO POLISH HOMES. REALLY VERY GOOD. >> CAN DISPLACED UKRAINIANS NOW MAKING UP 10% OF POLAND'S POPULATION, THE FUNDING OF NGO'S IS CRUCIAL TO SUSTAINING REFUGEE SUPPORT IN THE COUNTRY. >> WE DON'T WANT POLAND TO BECOME DESTABILIZED BY THIS CRISIS. AND TRAGICALLY I THINK PUTIN KNOWS THAT IT IS NOT JUST THROUGH MISSILES, BEING THROWN AT A COUNTRY THAT COULD DESTABILIZE A COUNTRY. HE COULD PUSH PEOPLE INTO A COUNTRY AS WELL TO DESTABILIZE IT. WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN POLAND IS TREMENDOUS STABILITY. THIS FOR POLAND IS 1939 AGAIN. THE POLs ARE LOOKING FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD FOR HELP AND TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS NOT JUST A POLISH PROBLEM, THIS IS AN INTERNATIONAL PROBLEM AND IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE AMERICANS\",\n",

       " \"SATISFIED WITH THE PRESENTATION THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. >> ALL RIGHT. GARRETT HAAKE, THANK YOU SO MUCH. GREATLY APPRECIATE IT. >>> PRESIDENT BIDEN LEAVES ON SATURDAY TO GERMANY FOR MEETING OF THE G7 FOLLOWED BY THE NATO SUMMIT IN SPAIN. ONE OF THE GOALS WILL BE TO KEEP ALLIES COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING UKRAINIANS THROUGH WHAT COULD BE A MONTHS' LONG WAR. WITH US NOW, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO POLAND, MARK BRZEZINSKI, AND ALSO U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE BRIDGET BRINK. THANK YOU SO MUCH. AMBASSADOR BRINK, SO GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE WITH US. I'M CURIOUS HOW ARE THINGS GOING RIGHT NOW WITH YOU GETTING SET UP AGAIN IN UKRAINE AND MORE TO THE POINT, WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING WHETHER THE EUROPEANS ARE STAYING FOCUSED ON THIS, WHETHER THE EU IS STAYING FOCUSED ON THIS, GERMANY AND FRANCE SPECIFICALLY. WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON HOW OUR ALLIES ARE DOING IN THE FIGHT AGAINST PUTIN? >> WELL, THANKS SO MUCH, JOE, FOR HAVING ME AND, MIKA, I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. MAYBE I JUST COULD TALK A SECOND ABOUT THE FIGHT. AFTER SUCCESSFULLY PUSHING RUSSIA AWAY FROM KYIV, THE FIGHT IS NOW VERY FOCUSED IN THE EAST IN THE AREA CALLED DONBAS AND IT\\nIS A REALLY TOUGH FIGHT, STREET IS A REALLY TOUGH FIGHT, STREET BY I CANKILOMETER BY KILOMETER. SO WHILE TREMENDOUS EUPHORIA INI COMING DOWN TO A DIFFICULT FIGHT. AND I'M BACK HERE IN WASHINGTON TO HAVE SENIOR LEVEL CONSULTATIONS AND REINFORCE SECRETARY AUSTIN AND HIS PUSH WITH MEMBERS OF THE CONTACT GROUP, 40 COUNTRIES WORKING TOGETHER TO PROVIDE SECURITY ASSISTANCE TO PUSH EVEN HARDER AND TO MOVE EVEN FASTER TO MOVE ASSISTANCE TO UKRAINE. THE EUROPEANS ARE STANDING WITH US, IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE STAY TOGETHER ON THE ASSISTANCE, ON THE SECURITY ASSISTANCE, ON THE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE, ON THE ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE AND ALSO ON THE SANCTIONS. AND SO FAR WE HAVE A VERY, VERY STRONG ALLIANCE AND I'M REALLY PROUD OF THAT AND I'M WORKING ALSO TO KEEP IT TOGETHER. >> PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY HAS SUGGESTED THAT GERMANY AND FRANCE IN PARTICULAR ARE TALKING MORE THAN DELIVERING MILITARY ITEMS. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US? >> I THINK WE'RE ALL WORKING TO -- I MEAN, WE'RE HERE -- I'M IN KYIV NOW WITH HIGH SMALL EMBASSY TEAM AND WE'RE WORKING TOPRE-VENT WIDER WAR, BUT DOING THAT BY HELPING THE UKRAINIANS NEED WHEN THE TIME COMES FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH. SO OUR GOAL IS TO HELP UKRAINE DEFEND ITSELF AND IS THAT THE GOAL THAT WE SHARE WITH OUR FRIENDS, PARTNERS AN ALLIES AND THAT IS WHAT WE'LL KEEP DOING UNTIL THE TIME COMES WHEN NEGOTIATIONS AREWILL BE POSSIBLE >> PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY HAS OBVIOUSLY BEEN VERY DIRECT ON WHAT HE NEEDS, WHAT HIS COUNTRY NEEDS, WHAT HIS MILITARY NEEDS FROM THE WEST. THERE HAS BEEN CRITICISM OF SEVERAL GOVERNMENTS. I'M CURIOUS, WHAT DOES HIS GOVERNMENT TELL YOU THE UKRAINIANS NEED FROM THE UNITED STATES AND THE EU AND NATO? >> FIRST THING THAT I HEAR FROM PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY BUT ALSO FROM EVERY OTHER UKRAINIAN IN GOVERNMENT AND OUTSIDE OF GOVERNMENT ON THE STREET IS THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO THE UNITED STATES AND THANK YOU TO EVERYBODY WHO HAS HELPED THEM ACHIEVE THE SUCCESS THAT THEY HAVE ACHIEVED SO FAR. AND IT IS ALSO DUE TO THEIR INCREDIBLE COURAGE AND BRAVERY IN THIS FIGHT. SO OF COURSE THEY ARE TALKING TO US SPECIFICALLY ABOUT WHAT THEY NEED AND WE ARE TALKING REGULARLY, MORE THAN DAILY, BASICALLY I'D SAY HOURLY WITH ME, WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF OUR GOVERNMENT, AND TO WHAT WE ARE DOING IS TO TRY TO MAKE SURE WE'RE GIVING THEM WHAT THEY NEED TO SUCCEED IN THIS FIGHT AND TO DEFEND THEMSELVES. >> AMBASSADOR BRZEZINSKI, MARK, RUSSIA'S INVASION OF UKRAINE IS LEADING TO DRAMATIC SHIFT IN OPINIONS ABOUT MOSCOW IN NEIGHBORING POLAND, NEW PEW RESEARCH CENTER POLL RELEASED YESTERDAY FOUND THAT 94% OF POLES SEE RUSSIA AS A MAJOR THREAT WHILE AN EQUAL PERCENT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY HAVE NO CONFIDENCE AT ALL IN VLADIMIR PUTIN. THE STUDY ALSO FOUND A MAJORITY OF POLES HAVE A FAVORABLE OPINION OF UNITED STATES AND 60% SAY THAT THEY HAVE CONFIDENT IN PRESIDENT BIDEN. IT REALLY IS REMARKABLE, MARK,\\nWHAT HAS HAPPENED IN POLAND OVER WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN POLAND OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. UNITED STATES POLICYMAKERS HAD ISSUES WITH POLAND. POLES HAD ISSUES WITH THE UNITED STATES. BUT IN THIS SAME PEW POLL, IT SHOWS THAT 90% OF POLES, ABOUT 90% OF POLES HAVE A POSITIVE IMPRESSION OF THE UNITED STATES. THAT IS REALLY NOTHING SHORT OF EXTRAORDINARY. AND I TALKED ABOUT GERMANY AND FRANCE. IT SEEMS THE UNITED STATES AND POLAND ARE THE TWO COUNTRIES WHO ARE STEPPING UP AND IN FRONT OF THE LINE TO HELP THE UKRAINIANS. >> JOE, THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME THIS MORNING. I'M SO PLEASED TO JOIN MY COLLEAGUE AMBASSADOR BRIDGET BRINK WHO IS IN KYIV. I THINK THAT IS FANTASTIC LEADERSHIP THAT SHE STARTED DAY ONE IN KYIV. JOE, YOU'RE RIGHT, THE UNITED STATES AND POLAND ARE DELIVERING FOR THE UKRAINIANS LIKE NONE OVER AND THAT IS NOT JUST TALK. IN TERMS OF THE VALUE OF THE MUNITIONS, IN TERMS OF THE VALVE THE LETHAL AND NONLETHAL AID, IT IS THE POLES AND THE AMERICANS WHO HAVE REALLY STEPPED UP. BUT WHAT IS AMAZING TO SEE, JOE, IS HOW THIS CRISIS HAS LED TO A BIG PUBLIC APPROVAL UPTICK IN ALL OF POLAND FOR AN EMBRACE OF THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES AND OF AN EMBRACE OF PRESIDENT BIDEN'S LEADERSHIP. LAST TIME THAT PEW PUBLIC OPINION POLL WAS TAKEN, THERE WAS ABOUT 50% PUBLIC APPROVAL RATING IN POLAND FOR THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES AND NOW IT IS 90% AND EVEN MORE AMAZING, POLAND HAS TAKEN IN MORE THAN 4 MILLION UKRAINIAN REFUGEES. THE PEW PUBLIC OPINION POLL SHOWS THAT POLISH PUBLIC OPINION IN SUPPORT OF TAKING IN EVEN MORE REFUGEES IS INCREASING AND IS WELL OVER 80%. SO AS THEY HAVE TAKEN IN AND PUT INTO POLISH HOMES AND APARTMENTS, MILLIONS OF UKRAINIANS, THE PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR TAKING IN MORE REFUGEES IS INCREASING. AN INCREDIBLE STORY AND I THINK THAT IT REALLY REFLECTS CONFIDENCE IN WHAT PRESIDENT BIDEN IS DOING IN DEVELOPING CONSENSUS AMONG ALLIES IN SUPPORT OF ZELENSKYY AND THE UKRAINIAN FIGHTERS. >> AND I'VE TALKED ABOUT IT ON THE SHOW BEFORE, MY DAUGHTER WAS ABLE TO SPEND THE LAST MONTH IN POLAND LOOKING AT WHAT THE POLES WERE DOING AS FAR AS HUMANITARIAN RELIEF, LOOKING AT HOW THEY WERE TAKING UKRAINIANS INTO THEIR HOMES AND ALSO SAYING THAT WHEREVER SHE WENT, SHE SAW THE UNITED STATES, THE HAND OF THE UNITED STATES, SUPPORT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND HELPING THOSE UKRAINIAN REFUGEES ALONG WITH THE POLES. SAID THAT IT WAS REALLY AWE-INSPIRING. AND IT IS, IT IS REMARKABLE WHAT THE POLISH PEOPLE HAVE DONE DURING THIS CRISIS. >> AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT, AMBASSADOR. IT IS GREAT TO SEE YOU. THROUGH ALL THE DARKNESS WE'VE SEEN IN UKRAINE, THE LIGHT THAT THE PEOPLE OF POLAND HAVE SHED IS EXTRAORDINARY FOR THE WORLD TO SEE. YOU TALK ABOUT 4 MILLION REFUGEES. THE POLES OPENING THEIR HOMES AND APARTMENTS TO COMPLETE STRANGERS. WHAT HAS IT BEEN LIKE FOR POLAND TO ABSORB THAT MANY PEOPLE AND POTENTIALLY MANY MORE HERE IN TERMS OF SCHOOLS AND JOBS AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT COMES WITH THAT? BECAUSE IT IS MORE THAN JUST OPENING THE DOOR TO YOUR APARTMENT. YOU ARE ABSORBING ALL THOSE PEOPLE IN YOUR SOCIETY. HOW IS THAT GOING? >> SURE. WELL, WILLIE, NEVER IN THE FUTURE WILL THERE BE A MASS MOVEMENT OF REFUGEES FROM ONE COUNTRY THAT DOES NOT THOUSAND INVOKE- NOW INVOKE THE HELP OF POLAND. NEVER BEFORE HAS THERE BEEN A NATIONAL LEADERSHIP THAT EVERY SINGLE ARRIVING REFUGEE WILL BE PLACED IN SOMEONE'S HOME OR APARTMENT. IMAGINE IN OUR PRIVATE SAID WE HAVE 5 MILLION PEOPLE FROM GUATEMALA COMING ACROSS THE TEXAS BORDER AND WE HAVE THE PLACEMENT OF EVERY ONE OF THOSE REFUGEES IN TO SOMEONE'S HOME. IT WOULD BE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN\\nAPPROACH THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN AND APPROACH THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN AND THAT IS WHAT THE POLES HAVE DONE EVERY ARRIVING UKRAINIAN REFUGEE IS GIVEN EVERY RIGHT THE POLISH CITIZEN HAS EXCEPT THE RIGHT TO VOTE. SO THEY ARE GIVEN THE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER, THE RIGHT TO SEND CHILDREN TO SCHOOLS, THE RIGHT TO PURSUE WORK. AND IN THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF NEW JOBS THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED IN POLAND IN THE TECH SECTORS, ALSO IN THE HOME CARE SECTORS, IN INDUSTRIAL SECTOR FOR JOBS FOR UKRAINIANS. SO IT IS WORKING. BUT THERE ARE LOGISTICAL LOGJAMS COMING DOWN THE PIKE. THE FOUR LARGEST CITIES IN POLAND ARE AT CAPACITY. AND AS THE GOVERNMENT TRIES TO DIRECT SOME OF THE NEWLY ARRIVING REFUGEES TO THE COUNTRYSIDE, THE REFUGEES DON'T WANT TO GO TO THE COUNTRYSIDE, THEY WANT TO GO TO THE CITIES. SO THERE ARE SOME LOGISTICAL TENSIONS. AND WE'LL SEE ON THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL SEPTEMBER 1 IN POLAND HOW -- WHETHER WE CAN HAVE ALL THE UKRAINIAN STUDENTS, UKRAINIAN CHILDREN, IN POLAND SITTING IN CLASSROOMS. THAT IS THE GOAL. BUT THERE IS A NATIONAL INSPIRED EFFORT TO DO THAT. >> EXTRAORDINARY AND HISTORIC. AMBASSADOR BRINK, BACK TO YOUR SIDE OF THE BORDER WHERE YOU ARE DOING YOUR WORK, I'M CURIOUS HOW YOU ARE LOOKING AT THIS WAR IN TERMS OF A TIME HORIZON. I MEAN, THE SUPPORT OF THE WORLD IS STILL THERE. OTHER NEWS AND LIFE INTERVENE AND IT GOES INTO THE BACK GROUND A BIT. BUT THE WAR PERSISTS. VLADIMIR PUTIN PERSISTS IN THE EAST. HOW DO YOU SEE THIS ENDING? IS THERE SOME KIND OF A NEGOTIATION, CAN THERE BE A NEGOTIATION WITH SOMEONE LIKE VLADIMIR PUTIN WHO HAS EARNED NO TRUST WHATSOEVER FROM UKRAINIANS OR ANYONE ELSE FOR THAT MATTER? WHERE AND HOW DOES THIS END ULTIMATELY? >> I JUST WANT TO REEMFORCE WHAT AMBASSADOR BRZEZINSKI SAID AS WELL. THERE ARE 7 MILLION IDPs IN UKRAINE AND 5 MILLION OUTSIDE OF UKRAINE. AND 3 MILLION WHICH POLAND HOSTS. SO THIS IS AN ENORMOUS CRISIS AND MANY DIMENSIONS. AND I CAN'T HAVE A BETTER PARTNER WITH AMBASSADOR BRZEZINSKI IN THE NEXT DOOR COUNTRY, SO I REALLY APPRECIATE HIM AND EVERYTHING THAT HE IS DOING AND EVERYTHING THAT THE POLES ARE DOING. TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT HOW DOES IT END, WE SUPPORT A SOVEREIGN INDEPENDENT PROSPEROUS AND DEMOCRATIC UKRAINE. WE HAVE SAID THAT WE SUPPORT PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY AND HIS GOVERNMENT. SO WHEN AND HOW HE DECIDES TO NEGOTIATE THE END OF THE WAR, ALL WARS DO HE SAID IN NEGOTIATION EVENTUALLY, AND WHAT WE ARE DOING NOW IS PROVIDING\",\n",
       " \"Hello everybody to my number three out of\\nmy top five that I had selected for Eurovision top five this year 2023 in Liverpool in England,\\nthe artist is called, Jann. I used to live not far from Liverpool but\\njust in Manchester not far from Manchester in Chester not far in Chester on the main\\nroad going into Chester going into Manchester therefore leading to Liverpool so there you\\ngo a bit of geography for you let's get to John the Gladiator that didn't Poland did\\nnot receive the judge's votes the judges were thinking with a certain part of their anatomy\\nand they certainly haven't got this because they wouldn't have picked the blonde representative\\nthat looks like an Instagram sad person and that's my personal view by the way I think\\nthe song that's representing Poland is shameful weak the artists can't sing live and for legal\\nreasons I won't mention in the artist's name or the name of the song but I'll just say\\nthat your representative of this year's 2023 composition uh competition in Eurovision is\\na no no no win it doesn't deserve to be in the final or anybody listening to it it's\\nthat bad this young man Jan singing Gladiator got 12 points from the public vote think about\\nthis and is not representing your country the public voted for this song and this artist\\nbut the judges around the so-called little areas you're voting which I don't believe\\nin the voting system anymore two years back we had Mayhem in Italy we had Mayhem in Spain\\nand now we've got Mayhem in Poland because we sitting at home are supposed to accept\\nthat your representative for the 2023 Eurovision was the best that you could produce unbelievable it's so bad it's bad and you\\nneed to be told judges none of you judges should be a judge next year on the national\\nTV judging for any competition representing your country after turning down what could\\nhave been one of the top five alternative well-written deep meaning and lyrically just\\nalternatively so good it's good and you're going to see why I am really as a musical\\nreactor going to public voted for him and when the judges votes came in he came to second\\nplace compare the two I want you to go and look for I'm not I'm not looking go and look\\nfor Poland's entry to Eurovision 2023 and see what you think then compare it to the\\nPublic's winning act they wanted to represent their country and if you're not in agreement\\nwith me that the judges are a bit iffy and that's an English word for a bit thinking\\nwith their there must have been an all-male judge all around the country then I don't\\nknow I just felt Jan you deserved it you really did who is John why are making such a fuss\\nI'll tell you now give a bit of Bio about the young man he deserves it Jan Rosen Rosa\\nmonski is known as Jan polishing and songwriter he was born in Lubin and grew up in Gowellen\\nhe's and he is the fourth of eight siblings his two old older sisters and an older brother\\nand two younger brothers now that in 2013 he participated in the first season of a television\\nprogram in Poland tell him and at the age of 12 he sang Grand Theatre in Warsaw for\\nthree years he attended the music school in Gold Woollen which he didn't finish because\\nat the age of 16 he moved with his parents to the city of Newry in Great Britain. Can I just correct everybody for geography\\nreasons, Newry is in Ireland. In fact, it’s a town that is situated on\\nthe border, the Irish Border, dividing Ireland and Northern Ireland. And if I was to just draw with my hand if\\nmy hand represented Ireland and this is let's say Yep this is Dublin and you're travelling\\nup to the north are my fingers here the line here is the Border Nuri would be let's say\\nthis finger just across and just before it on this side of the border is southern Ireland\\nand it's a village called Carlingford where my family is from and I couldn't believe that\\nI thought oh my God he went outside my Village across the border that's part of Northern\\nIreland that is part of obviously uh Great Britain and he he was trained there in the\\nArts so he um continues his education at the film performing arts school and another thing\\nJan you need to know my sister is married to Flynn foreign so there you go and then\\nhe currently lives in Warsaw now he releases Deputy single do you want to come over and\\nin 2022 released his mini album entitled power I'm going to be because of the connection\\nI'm going to be featuring you throughout 2023 I'm going to make the judges not the public\\nin Poland regret their decision and I have no faith in the judges anymore in in Eurovision\\nanywhere in the world because I'm honestly thinking it's corrupt I'm starting to think\\nmore and more countries are corrupt and there's no such thing as different people around the\\ncountry voting I'm just thinking that and I don't know I think the whole process needs\\nto be re-examined it's becoming a mess and I think with you Jan not representing Poland\\nit's proof and a couple of years ago it was Italy in Spain now it's this year it's for\\nsure the judges somebody has done something and here's my final thing on the whole thing\\nI'm just going to say this don't forget that Ukraine only won Ukraine's act I think kalush\\nonly won the competition because one of the judges was corrupt and they faced him when\\na live camera appeared on him lead singer of clutch went forth and said you're corrupt\\nI know you are something's wrong here with the voting and you voted for these reasons\\nand there was a whole investigation that judge was sacked and it was proven right and Kush\\nwent forth to represent Ukraine and won and now we're in Liverpool so think about that\\nPoland you need to be very, very, careful because when the public voted for Jan why\\ndid he not win your vote why did you not support the Public's vote why does your vote overtake\\nthe public the telephone and make you lots and lots of money I smell corruption but today\\nI'm going to justify this video this should have been 2023's representative for Poland\\nlike comment and tell me what you think and if you agree subscribe Jan welcome to my channel\\nfor 2023 and to the judges I get two fingers [Verse 1]\\nWelcome to the party, say hi to everybody Paid for by Martini but they're sippin' on\\nBacardi Body's more than just a flesh, you can sell\\nit for success What's your price, what's your address?

       " \"[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] on tuesday 26th of april 2022 at the us ramstein air base in germany an important summit was held more than 40 allied countries met to pledge the military support necessary for ukraine to withstand the onslaught of the russian bear in just the first two months since the invasion began the allies have delivered more than five billion dollars in military aid to ukraine nobody is fooled by putin's pretext or his phony claims on donbass russia's invasion is indefensible and so are russian atrocities nations of goodwill from around the world stand united in our resolve to support ukraine in its fight against russia's imperial aggression lloyd austin u.s secretary of defense visualpolitik fans beyond igniting solidarity with ukraine the russian invasion has made one thing clear you cannot trust tyrants least of all from countries as hostile as russia the idea is that if you're serious about peace you have to prepare for war this is a sentiment that is spreading throughout virtually every allied country in the world from germany to japan to australia and that's exactly what explains new stories like these german defense investment will double country's 2022 debt how the ukraine war is changing japan tokyo moves towards a more assertive security strategy but it is precisely in the former warsaw pact countries that this idea is taking root the most if we want to avoid the worst i.e war we have to act according to that ancient rule that says if you want peace prepare for war jarroslaw kaczynski deputy prime minister of poland and leader of pis virtually all central and eastern european countries have realized that they have to start preparing for war and as we say around here no sooner said than done that's exactly what they are doing and head and shoulders above them all one country stands out that is gradually becoming an influential european power listen up [Music] a leading player when the soviet union collapsed in the early 1990s the newly independent ukraine was one of the most economically prosperous post-communist states prosperous in terms of the soviet context if you know what i mean because the truth is that everything that resulted from the former soviet union was a mess even so ukraine's price-adjusted gdp per capita was about 20 higher than that of poland and if this margin had been maintained until today and ukraine had managed to carry out a political and economic transition as effective as that of poland or the czech republic the ukrainian economy today would be almost two-thirds the size of the russian economy of course as you all well know the story was very different [Music] ukraine's three decades of independence have been characterized by economic stagnation internal divisions and institutional decay that made ukraine the poorest country in all of europe the crisis was such that the ukrainian economy did not rise above its 1989 level until 2005. this set the scene for the first russian invasion of crimea and lately the invasion of the whole country however over the last 10 years things started to change in ukraine and in kiev they found a key partner in this whole process of course we are talking about poland [Music] during the last decade poland has perhaps been the country that has most influenced ukraine's political economic and even cultural development it has been its strongest supporter within the european union and nato it took in more than 1.5 million ukrainian workers before the invasion and gave this country the model to be able to leap into development [Music] we are talking about two countries with very close ties to each other in fact for centuries they were part of the polish lithuanian commonwealth and more recently they shared their rejection of soviet occupation there cannot be a free poland without a free ukraine nor a free ukraine without a free poland polish folk seeing well now after the russian invasion of ukraine poland has become one of the key players in the political news and also the country that is leading the european preparation for war listen up the new polish power russia's invasion of ukraine has made poland one of the key players in the crisis the country that is leading along with the united states and the united kingdom in supporting ukraine delivering military weaponry and hosting hundreds and hundreds of thousands millions of refugees in the first three weeks after the russian invasion alone poland took in more than two million refugees to give you an idea practically overnight it became fourth on the list for countries with the most refugees in the world behind only turkey colombia and the united states [Music] [Applause] since the beginning of the war the polish government and society have mobilized to put in place an unprecedented system of housing transportation food psychological support and aid of all kinds the polish government is even paying smaller monthly allowances to families who have arrived from ukraine to help get them by refugees are allowed to seek work in the country and the health and the education system has also been opened wide to them tens of thousands of ukrainian children are already enrolled in polish schools we are talking about a titanic effort and that's not all poland has also become the gateway to ukraine for western arms and supplies and one of the most relevant political players of the moment ukraine war turns poland into america's indispensable ally in other words poland has suddenly become one of the biggest adversaries of vladimir putin's russia it is also an example of the military race ahead because visual politic viewers poland is in the process of doubling its armed forces from about 110 000 troops to around 250 000 while also aiming to become one of the most modern armies in europe it is an extraordinary and historic moment the introduction of poland into a completely new world of cutting-edge technology modern weaponry and defensive means andrei duda president of poland because let's not forget that poland has a direct border with both russia through kaliningrad and belarus perhaps that is why poland is one of the few european countries whose military budget exceeds the 2 of gdp set as a minimum target by nato still in october 2021 polish deputy prime minister jarosuev kaczynski announced the country's intention to further raise its military effort to at least three percent of gdp thus in addition to more than doubling the size of its armed forces the polish government also wants to expand its territorial defense forces a support army composed of volunteer soldiers and above all to modernize its military arsenal by replacing combat systems dating back to the soviet era who knows how much of this equipment ends up or rather is seeing its last days fighting in ukraine what better time to clean up don't you think for example the polish army was still operating some 500 t-72 tanks when the russian offensive began and in its air force we still find aircraft such as mig-29s and su-22s however everything indicates that this situation will change very soon and not only because of arms shipments to ukraine in july 2021 for example the polish government announced the purchase of 250 u.s abram tanks to supplement the 250 leopard twos it currently has in its inventory another example is its aging air force over the last decade the number of operational fighter jets in poland fell from 128 to 98. to remedy this situation in 2020 the government announced a 4.6 billion deal for 32 f-35 aircraft to be delivered in 2024 that same year it also required a patriot type anti-aircraft battery system for 4.8 billion dollars more recently in may 2021 it acquired 24 bayracktar tb2 turkish drones all in all this is just a drop in the ocean in order to modernize its armed forces poland will have to make a major budgetary effort over the next few years however the government seems more than willing and that is not just us talking but rather the deputy prime minister and leader of the ruling party yaroslav kaczynski says so himself take a look it is better to be safe and a little more indebted jaroslaw kaczynski deputy prime minister of poland but while poland is perhaps the country that is leading the way in this kind of war preparation in eastern europe it is by no means the only one listen up [Music] fight club throughout central eastern europe they are generally very clear they do not trust moscow at all even being part of nato is not seen as enough so one way or another virtually all countries in this region are starting to get their act together to follow in poland's footsteps a good example is the czech republic a country where military spending has not exactly been a priority in recent years in 2022 for example only 1.35 percent of gdp was budgeted to be spent on defence which in any case was already a significant jump from the 0.95 they spent in 2015. be that as it may this is something that is going to change completely the czech government has announced that it intends to increase its military budget by 60 by 2025. bulgaria romania and the baltic republics are also announcing considerable increases in their military budgets romania wants to increase defence spending to 2.5 percent of gdp along the same lines estonia latvia and lithuania are going to increase their military spending by well over two percent and rest assured they will do so taking good note of what happened in ukraine for example i bet you anything that javelins will pay a very prominent role lithuania to spend over 1 billion dollars on weapons from us germany of course preparing for war is not exclusively about military spending or political relations there are many more variables that we have to take into account and one of them a very important one is the infrastructure and while you may be surprised this can be a weak point to win a war or pursue an effective deterrent strategy you don't just need an army you also need to be able to move it that's why this is precisely why in 2021 the connecting europe facility was agreed on a european union funding vehicle that provides 1.7 billion dollars to improve military mobility however we are talking about a very scarce budget at a time when the war has made it clear that these kind of provisions are needed so now we can say that the russian invasion of ukraine is making this issue a priority to prepare roads trains bridges ports and airports so that if necessary a lot of troops can be moved quickly [Music] this is especially urgent in eastern europe where many key pieces of infrastructure such as bridges may not be able to withstand the weight of american british or german tanks in europe one has had the view that if we didn't need to spend on defence since the 24th of february when russia attacked ukraine that view has changed completely george reichels analyst at the center for european politics for example one of the projects that could be accelerated the most is rail baltic a 5.8 billion euro that's over 6 billion us dollars standard gauge rail link connecting estonia latvia and lithuania with poland indispensable infrastructure to ensure that large troop movements could be carried out quickly in fact there is even talk of extending this line from estonia to finland by means of a tunnel under the sea well we can now expect this and other infrastructure projects to pick up much more speed so you see infrastructure is another important way to prepare for war and enhance europe's deterrent strategy visualpolitik fans history keeps telling us that a military victory does not always mean a geopolitical victory sometimes war only means defeat no matter what happens on the battlefield the u.s experience in afghanistan and iraq makes this clear as does moscow's own experience with the invasion of hungary in 1956 the invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 or the imposition of martial law in poland itself in 1981 in all of these cases triumph on the battlefields did not amount to a victory on the contrary we could say that they were small triumphs of a country that was already losing the cold war and that was unable to unite and win the loyalty of even its warsaw pact allies in fact in all of these cases the military intervention irretrievably distance hungarian czech and polish citizens much further from russia regardless of what happens on the battlefields of ukraine where russia is already paying a huge price in economic military and human terms the outcome of the war is going to be exactly the opposite of what moscow intended the distance distrust and hostility of ukrainians toward russia will last for years if not decades nato will emerge stronger more cohesive better prepared and with the incorporation of new countries from all this hardship we will talk about this soon here on visualpolitik if putin wanted less nato united against russia he's achieved the opposite and russia is also going to have a border with much more heavily armed and fortified neighbors for years russia has been trying to intimidate its former warsaw pact allies now it's only emboldened them but they will soon be in a position to look russia itself in the eye and to top it all off it is turning poland into a continental power [Music] whichever way you look at it russia has lost this war of course we already knew that if we were to hand out an award for the most absurd harebrained and counterproductive political idea of the last decade it would be hard to find a better candidate than putin with his heinous invasion of ukraine but at this point it's your turn how do you view the plans of the eastern european countries do you think poland will eventually establish itself as a full-fledged european power should the rest of europe follow suit leave us your comments below and now if you found this video interesting don't forget to like and subscribe to visualpolitik if you haven't already done so all the best i'll see you next time [Music] you\",\n",

       " \"Have you ever wondered what would happen if\\na bunch of ants fell down a hole into an old Cold War bunker\\nwith no way out? No? Just me? Well, while this sounds a bit like the beginnings\\nof an entomology-themed horror film, it really\\nhappened! And how these ants acted under such extreme circumstances can tell us about what those\\nants do normal– because even trapped in a nightmare, they\\nkept on ant-ing. [♪ INTRO] Allow me to set the scene. It’s the early twenty-tens in Poland, in a long abandoned Soviet bunker that once\\nhoused nuclear missiles during the Cold War. Inside the bunker is a colony of wood ants. Although, I use the word colony loosely here because these ants didn’t choose the bunker\\nlife. This bunker is underground and covered over with trees and dirt as camouflage. Inside, it’s cold, dark, and mostly empty\\nafter being sealed off and made illegal to enter by authorities. Wood ants are pretty common in these forests, and a colony of them happened to build a nest over the top of a vertical ventilation pipe\\nfor the bunker. Over time, the pipe’s metal outlet covering rusted through, leaving a hole. This caused ants from the nest above to fall onto the bunker floor below, with no way of getting back up or out of the\\nbunker. But that didn’t stop the ants from doing\\nwhat they do best: nesting. A team of researchers were tipped off to the\\npresence of this nest and found a way into the bunker. Because what are a few trespassing laws when\\nthere’s science to do? Once inside, the researchers could see these\\nants were building and maintaining a nest, removing\\ndead ants, and depositing them in ant cemeteries far\\nfrom the nest to keep it clean and prevent any potential\\ndisease from spreading. And all of this this is very normal ant behavior. But, the only ants they saw were workers – no queens, drones, or larvae. The constant rain of ants through the ventilation\\npipe was the only thing sustaining the bunker’s\\npopulation. And there was evidence that these ants had\\nbeen at it for years, doing their ant thing under some pretty harsh\\nconditions. But what were they eating down there? Well typically wood ants feed not on wood, but on the waste produced by aphids as they\\nfeed on tree sap. But there’s no aphids in an underground\\nbunker. When the researchers inspected the ants in\\nthe cemeteries, it became clear they had been snacking on\\neach other. Which is not super surprising, given the lack\\nof other available options. Now typically, cannibalizing your friends\\nisn’t something social insects, like ant colonies,\\ndo on the regular. However, wood ants are a known exception to\\nthis rule. Every spring, when various forest colonies\\nare coming out of their winter dormancy period,\\nthey engage in ant wars, killing each other en masse and then feasting\\non the corpses. This establishes colony borders, and provides\\nfood for the victors in the early days of spring\\nwhen food is scarce. Also, I want you to know that “ant wars”\\nis in fact the term used in the published literature. So, snacking on other wood ants is actually\\nnormal! Eating members of the same colony is not that normal until they’re desperate. But, our bunker ants were just doing what\\nthey had to do to survive. And they probably didn’t flinch too much\\nat this choice, considering they’re already predisposed\\nto the behavior. Now, in case you were worried, the researchers\\ndidn’t just finish their research and bounce out of there, leaving the bunker ants to their own devices. Instead, they assembled a vertical boardwalk\\nout of a two by four, to connect the floor with the ventilation\\npipe and give the bunker ants a way to reunite with\\ntheir original colony above. So hopefully, that put an end to it all, at\\nleast for this particular bunker! Now a Cold War bunker full of ants is one\\nof the worst things I can imagine getting someone\\nfor the holidays. Our merch site, dftba.com/scishow, has lots\\nof gifts that are both more portable and less prone\\nto biting. In particular, if you watched this episode\\nand feel in the mood for more incredibly specific animal behaviors, you might like our bucket hat with an orca\\nthat’s wearing its own hat. But! If you want your purchase to arrive anywhere\\nwithin the US by December 24th with standard shipping, you need to order by December 8th, 2023. Now, if you're watching this video in a different\\nyear, it's probably a different date. But if it's this year, then don't forget, December 8th, and don't forget to be awesome. [♪ OUTRO]\",\n",

Because of pandemic reasons and postpandemic, this year we didn't go anywhere abroad Firstly, we visited our Polish seaside which you could see in my previous vlog. Then, in July we spent some time together, just the two of us, glamping for the first time in the Polish mountains. It was a nice experience but sometimes scary because of the thunderstorms. And then, in August we decided to go to the seaside again but this time the weather wasn't really good You never know what to expect in Poland, so you have to be prepared for, actually, any kind of weather.

use it to cover your nose and your mouth because you guys\\nit's like the code enters through the nose and through the mouth so having this is not\\nreally a bad idea but the fact that it can pretty cover my nose and my mouth but the\\nreason why I'm a bit skeptical about this is the fact that it is not as thick as the\\nblack one so but the color is nice and I love the fact that it can cover the nose but the\\nthickness is not that thick you guys get so let me show you guys like the full the color is nice bro what do you guys think\\nI feel like it's actually more beautiful than the black one but the thickness and this winter\\nI don't know so let me just test the next one and then we choose so this is the third\\none and it's actually pink it has like Woody and this is what it looks like some basically\\ncontemplating between this and that brown one the brown one is actually cute but it's\\nnot as thick as this and also because I have like a black one you know which is actually\\nsix I'm like do I need to take two blocks or should I just mix this with the brown but\\nthe brown one is not as thick because it's weather hmm is not friendly for me so let\\nme know what you guys think

a sided zipper the zipper is at the side and the color is like gray\\nit's not dark it's not black it's like a gray color a deep gray color so I love the fact\\nthat you know it has a sided zip and also it has this thing at the waist to like tighten\\nthis up so I think I'm basically going to take this and the black one I initially tested\\nso that is it so let's go ahead now and shop for a fairly Used winter boots and I'll definitely\\nbring you guys along [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so guys\\nthe major issue I have with all these winter boots is the fact that it just opens at

       " 'In my view, I think North Korea is the world’s largest illegal job agency. It’s a company. The North Korean\\'s final workday is recorded accurately in the investigative report. The shift begins as it does everyday at six in the morning. The 41-year-old labourer is welding pipes in the stern of the Norwegian ship, the Polar Empress. Suddenly, his clothes begin to burn. But only after crawling out of the tank on all fours completely engulfed in flames, does a Polish co-worker hurry over to help him. He tries to put out the flames with fire extinguishers and water bottles. However, the labourer’s clothing continuesly reignites, until he can no longer be saved. He dies one day later in a Polish hospital. 95% of his skin was burned. I meet with the labourer inspector, who is responsible for investigating the accident. The labourer’s body was sent back to North Korea. together with 637 euros for his family. You may have heard of North Korean forced labourers from reports about labour camps in Russia or from Qatar, where stadiums are being built for the FIFA World Cup. But could there be North Korean forced labourers in Poland, in the middle of the EU? On its website, the CRIST shipyard advertises that they build ships for various clients throughout Europe. And we know that North Koreans are still working here today. We went to speak directly with the labourers to find out what their working conditions are really like. In order to protect the labourer’s identity, we’ve concealed his face and altered his voice. OK. Let\\'s go. Thanks. The North Korean man who died in the accident also worked for the company Armex. We wanted to find out how this kind of accident could have happened and how the laborers are paid so we asked the company for an interview But the manging director, Cecylia Kowalska, refused to talk to us. So, we tried to get a hold of her in her office We weren\\'t able to find Cecylia Kowalska but we discovered that she\\'s the managing director of another company it\\'s called Alson and it employs North Korean laborers at the Nauta shipyard. Lately, a mine hunting vessel belonging to the French navy has been repaired in the Nauta shipyard. In 2015, the North Koreans worked on constructing a supply ship meant to be deployed to a British off shore wind park We wait outside the ship yard to talk to North Korean laborers First to leave the site is a man who looks conspicuously different to a normal worker. The man makes it clear to us that he doesn\\'t want to answer any questions Then, he calls another colleague for help. Together, they monitor the exit of the shipyard Since, we can no longer talk to the laborers without being watched we decide to leave. What are the objectives of your working group and why was it created? It was created because we heard about the DPRK forced labour in the European Union which is well, strange to say the least, it took me by surprise Most of the DPRK laborers, they are, to a certain extent a leftover from the Cold War period Under Kim Jong-Un, this practice has seen a huge revival. Why does North Korea send laborers abroad? In my view, I think, North Korea is the world\\'s largest illegal job agency There is no real North Korean states There is North Korea or Pyongyang, Incorporated It\\'s a company. Due to international sanctions, the regime has hardly any opportunities to earn foreign currency That\\'s why Kim Jong-Un is sending laborers abroad primarily to China and Russia. Approximately 50,000 North Koreans are doing forced labor generating up to 2 billion dollars, according to the UN. Poland is especially important for North Korea because companies here pay the highest rates, comparatively. Cecylia Kowalska isn\\'t only the managing director of Armex and Alson. She\\'s also involved in a 3rd company, called Wonye, with 2 North Korean partners. We head to Wonye\\'s office to see if we can find Kowalska there. We don\\'t meet anyone in the office complex Instead, we find out more about one of Ms. Kowalska\\'s business partners. His name Kang Hung Gu and he was born in 1961. In a population register smuggled out of North Korea we find only one Kang Hong Gu with the same birth date. In 2004, this man was the commander of a brigade in North Korea. We want to know what such a high ranking member of the North Korean regime is doing in Poland and so we head to the address where he is registered, according to Polish authorities But none of the gas station employees have ever heard of him or of Wonye. So, we ask village residents if they have ever seen North Koreans in their area. And they live here? We didn\\'t find Kang Hong Gu but apparently North Korean laborers don\\'t just work in shipyards they also work in agriculture. We wanted to know why Cecylia Kowalska\\nhas a company with a North Korean who, allegedly, is a high ranking member of the North Korean regime. We head back to Gdansk and try again to find her at her office. Cecylia Kowalska says she pays each laborer in cash but on a pay stub from 2014, it looks like the same person signed for all the North Korean laborers On top of that, one of the laborers told us outside the shipyard that he doesn\\'t receive his salary from Armex but from a totally different company. Based on what the pay stub says, it\\'s clear the North Koreans worked on ships belonging to Danish and Norwegian shipping companies. According to the labor inspection record the company Armex worked together with the North Korean company Rungrado General Trading Corporation, which is the same company that also sends construction workers from North Korea to other Polish cities. Since, there\\'s no way to gain access to the construction site to talk to the laborers there, I asked the security guard. The construction company Atal declined to give us an interview but they inform us in writing that it isn\\'t them but rather a subsidiary, J.P. Construct,\\nthat would work with North Koreans. But the business is still in the family, The managing director of J.P. Construct is the son of the Atal chairman. We have received reports from inspections carried out by the labor inspectors from 2013 to 2015. According to these documents, the North Korean company, Rungrado Trading sent welders to Cecylia Kowalska\\'s company Armex who then put them to work in the shipyards. The same documents show that Rungrado Trading also set construction workers to the company J.P. Construct who then employed them on the building sites of the construction company Atal In return, Rungrado Training received money. Rungrado Trading is a state owned company run by the North Korean Worker\\'s Party whose chairman is dictator, Kim Jong-Un. It seems that most, if not all, of the money that\\'s being earned goes to the state rather directly or through a company that\\'s owned by the State A North Korean laborer in Europe earns about 80 to 160 dollars per month that\\'s what he keeps or she keeps himself if he or she is lucky But they\\'re paid much more than that and that money goes straight into the pocket of the North Korean State. Rungrado Trading describes itself, in an advertising brochure as a company that trades in cosmetics, mineral water, and clothing. However, the UN suspects Rungrado Trading of being involved in smuggling parts of SCAT missiles to Egypt. And it\\'s precisely this company that\\'s sending laborers to Poland. We wanted to find out how it\\'s at all possible that North Koreans can work in Poland. So, we met the deputy director of the regional government office responsible for handing out working permits to foreigners We weren\\'t able to find out why the authorities apparently don\\'t differentiate between two countries. But our official confirmed that North Koreans can work in Poland in a completely legal way. It makes Poland the only country in the EU, besides Malta, where that\\'s possible. We went to the National Labor Inspector at PIP. Over the last 5 years, it has inspected a dozen companies where North Koreans worked. We traveled to another big construction site to see how the working conditions are for North Koreans here. Atal is one of the leading Polish construction companies and specialize primarily in the construction of luxury apartments. When Polish Newsweek journalists ask about working with North Korea Atal answered in February, 2016: \"Running an ethical business primarily means lawful trade.\" This seems to imply that as long as you follow the law working together with an inhumane dictatorship would be OK. The laborers in Wroclaw and Warsaw seem to work 12 hours non-stop each day that\\'s only allowed if the laborers are compensated for over time. We want to know where and how the laborers live so we follow their bus. Since it was impossible to get into the compound to speak to the workers we call a North Korean laborer who gave us his number. In order to find out what kind of conditions North Koreans work in abroad, we meet the former guard of a prison camp for political dissidence. Ahn Myung Chul fled North Korea and now runs an aid organisation that draws attention to the forced laborer situation. Even the Polish authorities confirm that the North Koreans live in isolation. The Border Patrol was quoted in Poland\\'s Newsweek magazine as saying: \"They are an isolated crew that doesn\\'t take advantage of their right to move freely within our country and all activities could only be undertaken in the presence of an appointed representative who acts as a minder.\" We wanted to find out more about it from the authorities, but they declined to give us an interview. We make an appointment with Kim Seung Cheol, who is one of the very few North Koreans who fled while working in Russia, he explains to us why he thinks so few laborers flee. A North Korean also fled during his stay in Poland last year the Polish Foreigners Registration Office confirms that he received asylum but doesn\\'t want to say anything further about it. This basically means that North Korea can dispatch laborers to Poland completely legally and that the same laborers can get asylum if they no longer want to be exploited as forced laborers in the very same country. According to the International Labor Organization aspects of forced labor include; threats of punishment, excessive over time, deprevation of wages, and being forced to live in isolation. Which sounds exactly like the conditions under which North Koreans work in Polish shipyards. The laborer says that he has worked over 60 hours per week for the past 2 and half years without vacation or contact with his family. We head back to meet with Cecylia Kowalska\\nto confront her with this information. Nevertheless, Cecylia Kowalska honored the North Korean cabinets in the name of her company: Armex. Gifts presented to President Kim-Il Sung and Leader Kim Jung-Il by foreign heads of state, politicians, and public figures. This sword was presented by the president and vice president of the Armex Company Limited of Poland, on January 12th- The president of Armex is Cecylia Kowalska. The gift expresses the wish that Leader Kim Jung-Il would bring about not only peace on Korea but peace in independent\\'s cause in the world. We tried to speak to the North Korean embassy about their country\\'s close work with Armex but it didn\\'t answer our repeated requests for an interview. So we headed directly to the embassy but as soon as we get out of the car employees come out to send us away they make it clear that they are keeping an eye on us. We want to know from the Polish Ministry of Labor how many North Koreans are currently working in Poland. But they don\\'t answer us either. They apparently issued 1,972 work Visas to North Koreans over the last 5 years. but don\\'t know how many of them are currently working in Poland. The fact that the European Commission officially knows nothing about this is pretty bad. But what\\'s worse is that the EU is regularly helping to finance the forced labor through development plans. Over 70 million euros in EU funds have flowed into Crist and Nauta alone in recent years. Right into the shipyards, in which forced laborers from North Korea are exploited. But Poland has been behaving this way for over a decade. North Korean laborers have been toiling away here for years completely isolated from the outside world and their families And the meager amounts that they are paid; end up in the pockets of the regime. As long as this continues, it\\'s not only North Korea who will profit from the forced labor but Europe\\'s economy as well.',\n",

       " 'Since Poland’s most recent election in late\\n2015, rapid and potentially unconstitutional changes have created severe tensions within\\nthe European Union. The new conservative, anti-EU ruling party\\nin Poland has already been faced with threats of sanctions and a loss of voting power. So, what exactly did Poland do? And why is it alarming the EU? Well, to put Poland in perspective, it is\\nthe largest economy in Central Europe. Joining the EU marked an important transition\\nfor the the country, away from their authoritarian communist past. However, following several years of coalition\\nefforts between liberal and conservative parties, in October 2015, the right wing Law and Justice\\nparty won a majority in parliament. This was the first time a single party held\\nmajority power since the country restored democracy in 1989. Immediately after gaining control, the party\\npushed through a number of changes. First, they dismissed and replaced five recently\\nappointed Constitutional judges. Soon after, they passed a law reorganizing\\nthe Constitutional Court, forcing a two-thirds majority for changes. This directly conflicts with the Constitutional\\nrequirement of a simple majority. That made it considerably more difficult to\\nchange new legislation passed by the Law and Justice controlled parliament . Poland also passed a new media law, which\\nreplaced the administration of the nation’s public television and radio broadcasters with\\na former Law and Justice member of parliament. This series of new laws was quickly met with\\nopposition from the Polish public, with tens of thousands of citizens protesting in December\\nof 2015. Moreover, the President of the European Parliament\\nreferred to this shift as being similar to a “coup”. Other members of the EU have discussed imposing\\nsanctions on Poland. However, neighboring Hungary has dismissed\\nthe possibility, as they would refuse to take part in a unanimous vote to sanction. This is particularly important, as Hungary\\nhas also come under fire in recent years for its own media restructuring laws, which many\\nsay mirror Poland’s current crisis. The strongest rebuke has come from Germany;\\nAs Poland’s largest trading partner, it accounts for nearly a quarter of both exports\\nand imports. In response, Polish media has compared German\\nChancellor [An-guh-la] Merkel to Adolf Hitler, suggesting that Germany is seeking to control\\nPoland as they did in World War Two. By early January 2016, the European Commission\\nbegan an investigation on the basis of Article 7 of the Treaty of Lisbon. This states that if a member of the EU seriously\\nbreaches the union’s values, they can be stripped of their voting rights. As the controversy continues, it is likely\\nthat the EU will take action, either legal or diplomatic, to end what is considered Poland’s\\nviolation of constitutional balance. With Poland’s parliament currently unopposed,\\nthe Law and Justice party may be ushering in a new conservative era in Polish politics. What happens in Poland has the ability to\\nshift the balance of the European Union, largely due to their economic and political influence.

       " 'GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE. WE\\'VE JUST COMPLETED OUR SEVENTH MEETING OF THE UKRAINE DEFENSE  CONTACT GROUP, AND IT\\'S BEEN  ANOTHER HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL  SESSION. NOW, WE WERE MEETING TODAY AS  RUSSIA CONTINUES TO TARGET  UKRAINE\\'S CIVILIANS AND BOMBARD  ITS ENERGY GRID, BUT RUSSIA\\'S  DELIBERATE CRUELTY ONLY DEEPENS  OUR RESOLVE. WE\\'LL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT  UKRAINE\\'S BED ROOKIROCK RIGHT T  DEFEND ITSELF AND DEFEND  INTERNATIONAL ORDER. WE SAW YESTERDAY REPORTS OF A  DEADLY EXPLOSION IN POLAND NEAR  ITS BORDER WITH UKRAINE. I SPOKE LAST NIGHT TO MY POLISH  COUNTERPART, DEPUTY PRIME  MINISTER AND MINISTER OF  NATIONAL DEFENSE, BLOSCHUCK, AND CONVEYED MY DEEP CONDOLENCES TO  THE POLISH PEOPLE AND THE LOVED  ONES OF THOSE WHO WERE KILLED. I ALSO UNDERSCORED AMERICA\\'S  IRONCLAD COMMITMENT TO DEFEND  POLAND. WE HAVE FULL CONFIDENCE IN THE  POLISH GOVERNMENT\\'S  INVESTIGATION OF THIS EXPLOSION, AND THEY\\'VE BEEN CONDUCTING THAT INVESTIGATION IN A PROFESSIONAL  AND DELIBERATE MANNER. SO WE WON\\'T GET AHEAD OF THEIR  WORK. WE\\'RE GOING TO STAY IN CLOSE  TOUCH WITH OUR POLISH  COUNTERPARTS AS WELL AS WITH OUR NATO ALLIES AND OTHER VALUED  PARTNERS. WE\\'RE STILL GATHERING  INFORMATION, BUT WE HAVE SEEP  NOTHING THAT CONTRADICTS  PRESIDENT DUDA\\'S PRELIMINARY  ASSESSMENT THAT THIS PLOIGS WAS  MOST LIKELY A UKRAINE AIR  DEFENSE MISSILE THAT  UNFORTUNATELY LANDED IN POLAND  AND WHATEVER THE FINAL  CONCLUSIONS MAY BE, THE WORLD  KNOWS THAT RUSSIA BEARS ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS  INCIDENT. RUSSIA LAUNCHED ANOTHER BARRAGE  OF MISSILES AGAINST UKRAINE,  SPECIFICALLY INTENDED TO TARGET  UKRAINE\\'S CIVILIAN  INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS TRAGIC AND TROUBLING  INCIDENT IS YET ANOTHER REMIND  ARE OF THE RECKLESSNESS OF  RUSSIA\\'S WAR OF CHOICE. UKRAINE HAS A BEDROCK RIGHT TO  DEFEND ITSELF, AND WE WILL  CONTINUE TO STAND IN SOLIDARITY  WITH THE PEOPLE OF UKRAINE AS  THEY DEFEND THEIR COUNTRY AND WE WERE JOINED TODAY AT THE CONTACT GROUP MEETING BY MY GOOD FRIEND  UKRAINE\\'S MINISTER OF DEFENSE  AND DEPUTY CHIEF OF DEFENSE, THE LIEUTENANT GENERAL. I SPOKE WITH THE GENERAL BEFORE  PHONE BEFORE THIS MORNING\\'S  CONTACT GROUP MEETING ABOUT  YESTERDAY\\'S EXPLOSION IN POLAND. AND WILL REMAIN IN CLOSE  CONSULTATION AS WE MOVE FORWARD. UKRAINE\\'S COMMANDERS HAVE SHOWN  TREMENDOUS LEADERSHIP AND  TENACITY, AND THEY UPDATED THE  CONTACT GROUP THIS MORNING ON  THE CURRENT BATTLEFIELD DYNAMICS AND ON UKRAINE\\'S MOST URGENT  SELF-DEFENSE NEEDS. UKRAINE\\'S TROOPS CONTINUES TO  CONSOLIDATE THEIR GAINS ON THE  BATTLEFIELD AS THEY HEAD INTO  THE WINTER, AND THE CONTACT  GROUP CONTINUES TO PUSH HARD TO  BOLSTER UKRAINE\\'S AIR DEFENSES  IN THE FACE OF RUSSIA\\'S ONGOING  BARRAGES. I\\'M PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO REPORT THAT THE AIR DEFENSE SYSTEMS  THAT WE\\'VE SENT TO UKRAINE ARE  NOW OPERATIONAL, AND THEIR  PERFORMANCE SO FAR HAS BEEN VERY IMPRESSIVE. THE SYSTEMS HAD A 100% SUCCESS  RATE IN INTERCEPTING RUSSIAN  MISSILES AS THE KREMLIN  CONTINUES ITS RUTHLESS  BOMBARDMENT OF UKRAINE,  INCLUDING YESTERDAY\\'S ATTACKS. WE\\'RE ALSO WORKING TO SECURE  MORE CRITICAL EQUIPMENT TO  PROTECT AND REPAIR UKRAINE\\'S  ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE AFTER  RUSSIA\\'S INDEFENSIBLE ATTACKS. WE ALSO HEARD AN UPDATE FROM OUR SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER IN  EUROPE. I\\'M CONFIDENT THAT TRAINING  EFFORTS SPEARHEADED BY THE  UNITED STATES AND MANY OTHER  MEMBERS OF THE CONTACT GROUP  QUILL QUIP THE UKRAINE ARMED  FORCES WITH THE SKILLS THEY NEED TO CONSOLIDATE THEIR GAINS AND  SEIZE NEW OPPORTUNITIES ON THE  BATTLEFIELD. I WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE  EUROPEAN UNION\\'S IMPORTANT  EFFORT\\'S HERE. THE EU\\'S TRAINING PROGRAM ACROSS EUROPE WILL DO GREAT DEAL TO  REINFORCE WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES  ARE DOING BILATERALLY. I WOULD LIKE TO RECOGNIZE  GERMANY AND POLAND FOR THEIR  LEADERSHIP IN THIS LARGE MISSION AND LET ME THANK THE UK FOR  PLEDGING TO TRAIN ANOTHER 19,000 UKRAINIAN TROOPS NEXT YEAR. THE CONTACT GROUP DISCUSSED  IMPORTANT INDUSTRIAL BASED  INITIATIVES TO SUSTAIN OUR  SECURITY ASONIA SSISTANCE TO UK. LET ME THANK THE ACQUISITION AND SUSTAINMENT TEAM AND THE CO-HOST OF THE NATIONAL ARMAMENT  DIRECTORS WORKING GROUP UNDER  THE CONTACT GROUP AUSPICIOUS. ALL THESE HELP PREPARE THE  UKRAINIANS TO CONSOLIDATE THEIR  GAINS AND NEW INITIATIVES IN THE SPRING. YOU CAN SEE THIS CONTACT GROUP\\'S ONGOING UNITY AND COMMITMENT IN  SOME OF THE ANNOUNCEMENTS ITS  MEMBERS MADE. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK SWEDEN FOR COMING FORWARD TODAY WITH A  SUBSTANTIAL $287 MILLION PACKAGE OF ASSISTANCE TO UKRAINE. THIS PACKAGE INCLUDES KEY  CAPABILITIES INCLUDING AN AIR  DEFENSE SYSTEM THAT WILL BOLSTER UKRAINE\\'S ABILITY TO DEFEND  ITSELF AGAINST RUSSIA\\'S ONGOING  RUTHLESS ATTACKS. SPAIN HAS PROMISED TO SEND TWO  MORE HAWK LAUNCHES AND MISSILES  AND CANADA IS STEPPING UP WITH  ITS LATEST TRANCHE OF $500  MILLION IN ASSISTANCE AND CANADA REMAINS ONE OF THE LEAD DONORS  OF WINTER GEAR. GERMANY HAS ADVANCED MUCH NEEDED DONATIONS OF AIR DEFENSE,  ARTILLERY AND MRLS AMMUNITION  AND GREECE ANNOUNCED AN  IMPORTANT DONATION OF 155  MILLIMETER AMMUNITION AND POLAND HAS COMMITTED ADDITIONAL  ARTILLERY AND TANK AMMUNITION  AND SHORT RANGE AIR DEFENSE  CAPABILITIES. SO THESE CONTRIBUTIONS WILL MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE. AND SO DOES A COORDINATION OF  OUR SECURITY ASSISTANCE THAT  THIS CONTACT GROUP MAKES  POSSIBLE. SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO DEEPEN  OUR WORK TOGETHER AND THE  CONTACT GROUP HAS MET SEVEN  TIMES THIS YEAR AN EACH MEETING  HAS PRODUCED TANGIBLE RESULTS  THAT HELP UKRAINE DEFEND ITSELF, AND ITS CITIZENS. YOU CAN SEE THAT PROGRESS IN  UKRAINE\\'S VICTORIES IN KHARKIV  AND KHERSON. OVER THE WEEKEND THE WORLD SAW  UKRAINIAN FORCES LIBERATE  KHERSON. DEMONSTRATING ONCE AGAIN THE  DETERMINATION OF THE UKRAINIAN  PEOPLE TO LIVE FREE IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY. NOW OUR RESOLVE IS ONLY  STRENGTHENED BY RUSSIA\\'S  INDEFENSIBLE ATTACKS ON CIVILIAN TARGETS. WE\\'LL CONTINUE TO STAND TOGETHER IN COMMON PURPOSE BECAUSE NO  MEMBER OF THIS CONTACT GROUP  WANTS TO LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE  BIG COUNTRIES BULLDOZE THEIR  PEACEFUL NEIGHBORS. WE WON\\'T JUST ACCEPT PUTIN\\'S  AGGRESSION AND NORMS AS SOME  KIND OF NEW NORMAL. WE WILL CONTINUE TO STAND UP FOR UKRAINE\\'S RIGHTS TO DEFEND  ITSELF AND STRENGTHEN OUR UNITY  AND RESOLVE, WE\\'LL CONTINUE TO  SHOW THE POWER OF PARTNERSHIP  AND CONTINUE TO BOLSTER  UKRAINE\\'S ARMED FORCES BY  RUSHING THEM THE CAPABILITIES  THEY THESE TO DEFEND THEIR  COUNTRY AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO  HELP THE PEOPLE OF UKRAINE IN  THEIR FIGHT FOR FREEDOM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I\\'LL  TURN IT OVER TO GENERAL MILLEY  FOR HIS OPENING COMMENTS. >> THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT AND APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIPP AS WE GATHER  FOR THE SEVENTH CONTACT GROUP  WE\\'VE BEEN DOING EVERY MONTH. THANKS ALSO TO ALL THE MINISTERS OF DEFENSE OUT THERE WHO  PARTICIPATED AND ALL MY  COUNTERPARTS THAT PARTICIPATED  AND SENIOR REPRESENTATIVES FROM  AND SENIOR REPRESENTATIVES FROM  ALMOST 50 COUNTRIES SHOWED UP  THIS MORNING AND CONTINUE TO  TAKE PART IN THESE DISCUSSIONS  WHICH ARE VERY, VERY PRODUCTIVE. THE MISSION OF THE GROUP REMAINS CLEAR TO SUPPORT UKRAINE AS THEY COUNTER THE ILLEGAL AND  UNPROVOKED RUSSIAN AGGRESSION  AND CONTINUE TO SUPPLY UKRAINE  WITH THE CAPABILITIES NECESSARY  TO DEFEND THEIR SOVEREIGNTY. THROUGH THESE CONTACT GROUP  SESSIONS AND OTHER CLOSE  COORDINATIONS THAT I HAVE AND  THE SECRETARY HAS WITH OUR  COUNTERPARTS, THAT I TALKED TO  WEEKLY AND MY STAFF CONTINUALLY  TALKS TO HIS STAFF WE CONTINUE  TO RESPOND TO UKRAINE\\'S  BATTLEFIELD REQUIREMENTS AND  THEIR NEEDS FOR MEANS OF  FIGHTING FOR THEIR FREEDOM. THIS IS A WAR OF CHOICE. IT\\'S A WAR OF CHOICE FOR RUSSIA. THEY EMBARKED ON A TREMENDOUS  STRATEGIC MISTAKE. THEY MADE A CHOICE IN FEBRUARY  OF THIS YEAR TO ILLEGALLY INVADE A COUNTRY THAT POSED NO THREAT  TO RUSSIA. IN MAKING THAT CHOICE, RUSSIA  ESTABLISHED SEVERAL OBJECT  TUFBS. THEY WANTED TO OVERTHROW  PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY AND HIS  GOVERNMENT. THEY WANTED TO SECURE ACCESS TO  THE BLACK SEA. THEY WANTED TO CAPTURE ODESA. THEY WANTED TO SEIZE TO THE  DNIPRO RIVER, PAUSE, AND  CONTINUE TO ATTACK TO THE  CARPATHEN MOUNTAINS. IN SHORT THEY WANTED TO OVERRUN  ALL OF UKRAINE AND THEY LOST. THEY DIDN\\'T ACHIEVE THOSE  OBJECTIVES. HE THEY FAILED TO ACHIEVE THEIR  STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND NOW  FAILING TO ACHIEVE THEIR  OPERATIONAL AN TACTICAL  OBJECTIVES. RUSSIA CHANGED THEIR WAR AIMS IN MARCH AND IN THE BEGINNING OF  APRIL. THEIR WAR OF CHOICE THEN FOCUSED ON THE SEIZURE OF THE DONBAS,  DONESTK. THAT WAS THEIR OPERATIONAL  OBJECTIVES AND THEY FAILED  THERE. THEN THEY CHANGED AGAIN AND  EXPANDED TO SEIZE ZAPORIZHZHIA  AND KHERSON. THESE STRATEGIC REFRAMING OF  THEIR OBJECTIVES, OF THEIR  ILLEGAL INVASION HAVE ALL  FAILED, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF  THEM. WE\\'VE WITNESSED LAST WEEK  RUSSIA\\'S RETREAT FROM KHERSON. THEY RETREATED ACROSS THE DNIPRO RIVER, MOVED TO MORE DEFENSIBLE  POSITIONS SOUTH OF THE RIVER,  THEIR LOSSES DUE TO UKRAINIAN  SUCCESS AND SKILL AND BRAVERY ON THE BATTLEFIELD HAVE BEEN  SIGNIFICANT. IT\\'S CLEAR THAT THE RUSSIAN WILL TO FIGHT DOES NOT MATCH THE  UKRAINIAN WILL TO FIGHT. ON THE BATTLEFIELD, UKRAINIANS  OFFENSIVE IN KHARKIV HAS BEEN  SUCCESSFUL WHERE THEY CROSSED  THE RIVER AND THEY HAVE MOVED TO THE EAST AND ARE NEAR THE TOWN  OF SAVTOVI. THERE IS A FIGHT RIGHT NOW IN  THE VICINITY WHERE THE  UKRAINIANS ARE FIGHTING A VERY  SUCCESSFUL MOBILE DEFENSE. THERE IS LIMITED CONTACT RIGHT  NOW IN ZAPORIZHZHIA AND LIMITED  CONTACT IN AND AROUND THE  ZAPORIZHZHIA NUCLEAR POWER  PLANT. AS WE DISCUSSED KHERSON\\'S  OFFENSIVE HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL. ACROSS THE ENTIRE FRONT LINE  TRACE, THE UKRAINIANS HAVE  ACHIEVED SUCCESS AFTER SUCCESS  AFTER SUCCESS. THE RUSSIANS HAVE FAILED EVERY  SINGLE TIME THEY\\'VE LOST  STRATEGICALLY, OPERATIONALLY AND TACTICALLY. WHAT THEY TRIED TO DO THEY  FAILED AT. THEY STARTED THIS WAR AND RUSSIA CAN END THIS WAR. RUSSIA CAN MAKE ANOTHER CHOICE  AND MAKE A CHOICE TO END THIS  WAR. HOWEVER, RUSSIA IS CHOOSING TO  USE THEIR TIME TO ATTEMPT TO  REGROUP THEIR FORCES AND THEY  ARE IMPOSING A CAMPAIGN OF  TERROR AND SUFFERING ON THE  UKRAINE CIVILIAN POPULATION TO  DEFEAT UKRAINE MORALE. THE RUSSIANS ARE STRIKING  THROUGHOUT THE DEPTH AND BREATH  WITH CRUISE MISSILES AND OTHER  TYPES OF MUNITIONS. THEY ARE STRIKING THE UKRAINE  CIVILIAN INFRASTRUCTURE. AND IT HAS LITTLE OR NO MILITARY PURPOSE. WHILE ASSESSMENTS ARE ONGOING  YESTERDAY\\'S STRIKES LOOKS LIKE  THEY LAUNCHED AT LEAST 60  MISSILES AND UPWARDS OF 90s OR  PERHAPS 100 AND WE\\'LL HAVE  BETTER ASSESSMENTS IN THE DAYS  AHEAD. BUT IT WAS LIKELY THE LARGEST  WAVE OF MISSILES WE\\'VE SEEN  SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR. THESE MISSILES INTENTIONALLY  TARGETED AND DAMAGED CIVILIAN  POWER GENERATION FACILITIES TO  CAUSE UNNECESSARY SUFFERING WITH THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. WE ASSESS NOW OVER A QUARTER OF  UKRAINIAN CIVILIANS ARE WITHOUT  POWER. THE DELIBERATE TARGETING OF THE  CIVILIAN POWER GRID CAUSING  EXCESSIVE COLLATERAL DAMAGE AND  UNNECESSARY SUFFERING ON THE  CIVILIAN POPULATION IS A WAR  CRIME. WITH THE ONSET OF WINTER,  FAMILIES WILL BE WITHOUT POWER  AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WITHOUT  HEAT. BASIC HUMAN SURVIVAL AND  SUBSISTENCE IS GOING TO BE  IMPACTED AND HUMAN SUFFERING FOR THE UKRAINIAN POPULATION IS  GOING TO INCREASE. THESE STRIKES WILL UNDOUBTEDLY  HINDER UKRAINE\\'S ABILITY TO CARE FOR THE SICK AND ELDERLY. THEIR HOSPITALS WILL BE  PARTIALLY OPERATIONAL. THE ELDERLY ARE GOING TO BE  EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTS. IN THE WAKE OF UNRELENTING  RUSSIAN AGGRESSION AND  INCALCULABLE HUMAN SUFFERING  UKRAINE WILL CONTINUE TO ENDURE. UKRAINE IS NOT GOING TO BACK  DOWN. THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE ARE HARD,  THEY\\'RE TOUGH, AND MOST OF ALL,  THEY\\'RE FREE AND THEY WANT TO  REMAIN FREE. UKRAINE IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO  TAKE THE FIGHT TO THE RUSSIANS. AND I JUST HAD A SIGNIFICANT  CONVERSATION WITH MY UKRAINIAN  COUNTERPART, AND HE ASSURES ME  THAT IS THE FUTURE FOR UKRAINE. AS UKRAINE CONTINUES TO FIGHT,  AIR DEFENSE CAPABILITIES ARE  BECOMING CRITICAL FOR THEIR  FUTURE SUCCESS. AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM, AN  INTEGRATED AIR DEFENSE SYSTEM,  AN INTEGRATED AIR AND MISSILE  DEFENSE SYSTEM IS WHAT IS  NECESSARY, AS UKRAINE REPELS  RUSSIAN ARIEL ATTACKS AND A  SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF TODAY\\'S  CONVERSATIONS IN TODAY\\'S MEETING WITH ALMOST 50 COUNTRIES,  FOCUSED ON HOW WE, AS A GLOBAL  COALITION, CAN PROVIDE THE RIGHT MIX OF AIR DEFENSE SYSTEMS AND  AMMUNITION FOR UKRAINE TO  CONTINUE ITS CONTROL OF THE  SKIES AND PREVENT THE RUSSIANS  FROM ACHIEVING AIR SUPERIORITY. TO COMBAT CONTINUED RUSSIAN  STRIKES LAST THURSDAY THE UNITED STATES ANNOUNCED A $400 MILLION  IN ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS TO  CUPP UKRAINE THAT INCLUDED  MISSILES FOR THE HAWK AIR  DEFENSE SYSTEMS WHICH IS A  COMPLEMENT TO WHAT SPAIN HAS  RECENTLY COMMITTED. THERE\\'S OTHER AIR DEFENSE  SYSTEMS INCLUDED IN THAT $400  MILLION PACKAGE ALONG WITH  GROUND SYSTEMS SUCH AS HUMVEES,  GRENADE LAUNCHES AND AMMUNITION  AND OTHER PIECES OF EQUIPMENT. WARS ARE NOT FOUGHT BY ARMIES. THEY\\'RE FOUGHT BY NATIONS. THIS WAR IS FOUGHT BY THE  UKRAINIAN PEOPLE AND FOUGHT BY  THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE. THIS IS A WAR THAT RUSSIA\\'S  LEADERSHIP HAS CHOSEN TO PUT  RUSSIA INTO. THEY DIDN\\'T HAVE TO DO THIS. BUT THEY DID. THEY HAVE VIOLATED UKRAINIAN  SOVEREIGNTY AND VIOLATED  TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF  UKRAINE. IT IS IN COMPLETE CONTRADICTION  TO THE BASIC RULES THAT  UNDERLINE THE UNITED NATIONS  CHARTER ESTABLISHED AT THE END  OF WORLD WAR II. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST  SIGNIFICANT ATTEMPTS TO DESTROY  THE RULES-BASED ORDER THAT WORLD WAR II WAS FOUGHT ALL ABOUT. WE, THE UNITED STATES, ARE  DETERMINED TO CONTINUE TO  SUPPORT UKRAINE WITH THE MEANS  TO DEFEND THEMSELVES FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES, BUT AT THE END OF  THE DAY, UKRAINE WILL RETAIN --  WILL REMAIN A FREE AND  INDEPENDENT COUNTRY WITH ITS  TERRITORY INTACT. RUSSIA COULD ENDS THIS WAR  TODAY. RUSSIA COULD PUT AN END TO IT  RIGHT NOW. BUT THEY WON\\'T. THEY\\'RE GOING TO CONTINUE THAT  FIGHT. THEY\\'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO  THAT FIGHT INTO THE WINTER AS  BEST WE CAN TELL. WE THE UNITED STATES UNDER THE  DIRECTION OF THE PRESIDENT AND  SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, WE WILL  CONTINUE TO SUPPORT UKRAINE FOR  AS LONG AS IT TAKES TO KEEP THEM FREE, SOVEREIGN, INDEPENDENT,  WITH THEIR TERRITORY INTACT. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED  STATES HAS BEEN VERY, VERY CLEAR TO US, THAT IT\\'S UP TO UKRAINE  TO DECIDE HOW IT AND WHEN OR IF  THEY NEGOTIATE WITH THE  RUSSIANS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THEM AS LONG AS IT TAKES. THE UNITED STATES WILL CONTINUE  TO SUPPORT UKRAINE WITH THE BEST POSSIBLE EQUIPMENT TO POSITION  THEM ON THE BATTLEFIELD, TO GIVE THEM POSITIONS OF STRENGTH  AGAINST THE RUSSIANS, AND THAT  IS ALSO TRUE OF ALL THE OTHER  NATIONS THAT ATTENDED THE  MEETING TODAY. THERE IS AN ABSOLUTE SENSE OF  URGENCY, AN ABSOLUTE SENSE OF  DETERMINATION ON THE PART OF ALL THE MEMBER STATES THAT ATTENDED  OUR MEETING TODAY AND I CAN TELL YOU THE COHESION AND COHERENCE  OF THE ORGANIZATION IS COMPLETE. AND THE RESOLVE IS HIGH. UKRAINIANS ARE NOT ASKING FOR  ANYONE TO FIGHT FOR THEM. THEY DON\\'T WANT AMERICAN  SOLDIERS OR BRITISH OR GERMAN OR FRENCH OR ANYBODY ELSE TO FIGHT  FOR THEM. THEY WILL FIGHT FOR THEMSELVES. ALL UKRAINE IS ASKING FOR IS THE MEANS TO FIGHT. WE ARE DETERMINED TO PROVIDE  THAT MEANS. UKRAINIANS WILL DO THIS ON THEIR TIMELINE AND UNTIL THEN, WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT ALL THE WAY  FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES. IT IS EVIDENT TO ME AND THE  CONTACT GROUP TODAY THAT THAT IS NOT ONLY A U.S. POSITION, BUT IT IS A POSITION OF ALL THE NATIONS WERE THERE TODAY. WE WILL BE THERE FOR AS LONG AS  IT TAKES TO KEEP UKRAINE FREE. THANK YOU AND I WELCOME YOUR  QUESTIONS.  >> MR. SECRETARY AND CHAIRMAN,  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FIRST QUESTION TO ASSOCIATED  PRESS.  >> THANK YOU. MR. SECRETARY, PRESIDENT  ZELENSKYY JUST DENIED IT WAS A  UKRAINIAN AIR DEFENSE MISSILE  THAT LANDED IN POLAND. HOW ARE YOU CERTAIN THIS WAS  POSSIBLY A UKRAINIAN AIR DEFENSE MISSILE AND WAS NOT A RUSSIAN  MISSILE? >> THANKS. FIRST OF ALL, THE INVESTIGATION  IS STILL ONGOING AND POLAND IS  CONDUCTING THAT INVESTIGATION. WE ARE ASSISTING IN ANY WAY WE  HAVE. WE HAVE SOME EXPERTS HELPING AND HELPING PO LUSH LEAD-- POLISH  LEADERSHIP. WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN POLAND\\'S  INVESTIGATION IN A PROPER WAY  AND UNTIL THAT\\'S COMPLETE IT  WOULD BE PREMATURE FOR ANYBODY  TO JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS. I KNOW THAT UKRAINE HAS OFFERED  TO PARTICIPATE AND HELP IN ANY  WAY THEY CAN AS WELL. SO WE WON\\'T GET AHEAD OF, YOU  KNOW, WHAT -- OF THE  INVESTIGATION, BUT, YOU KNOW,  OUR INFORMATION SUPPORTS WHAT  PRESIDENT DUDA SAID EARLIER IN  HIS PRELIMINARY HE ASSESSMENT  THIS WAS MOST LIKELY A RESULT OF UKRAINIAN AIR DEFENSE MISSILE. WE\\'LL LET THE INVESTIGATION PLAY OUT HERE.  >> AT THIS POINT ARE YOU  CONFIDENT IN SAYING THAT THIS  WAS NOT A RUSSIAN MISSILE? >> WE\\'RE GOING TO LET THE  INVESTIGATION PLAY OUT AND THEN  ONCE THE RESULTS ARE RELEASED  WE\\'LL BE CONFIDENT IN  EVERYTHING. AGAIN, WE -- OUR INFORMATION  SUPPORTS WHAT PRESIDENT DUDA  SAID EARLIER. >> CHAIRMAN MILLEY, AFTER THIS  STRIKE OCCURRED, DID YOU REACH  OUT TO YOUR RUSSIAN COUNTERPART  OR DID ANY OTHER MILITARY  OFFICER REACH OUT TO THEIR  RUSSIAN COUNTERPARTS TO PROTECT  AGAINST ESCALATION AND IF NOT,  WHY NOT? >> THERE WERE -- I DO ASK MY  STAFF TO SET THE CALLS UP. THE ANSWER IS YES, AND ATTEMPTS  WERE MADE. NO SUCCESS WITH THE RUSSIAN  COUNTERPART. I DID TALK TO MY UKRAINIAN  COUNTERPART IMMEDIATELY SEVERAL  TIMES, IN FACT, AND POLISH  COUNTERPART AND SEVERAL OTHERS  IN EUROPE. EXACTLY WHAT SECRETARY STAAID,   INVESTIGATION IS UNDERGOING,  PROFESSIONALS ARE THERE TO DO  THE FORENSICS, ALL THE DEBRIS  AROUND THE IMPACT SITE AND  SHORTLY WE\\'LL KNOW ALL THE  FACTS. >> RUSSIA DID NOT TAKE THE CALL? >> RIGHT. MY STAFF WAS UNSUCCESSFUL  GETTING ME LINKED UP WITH THE  GENERAL. THAT\\'S CORRECT. >> NEXT QUESTION. ABC. . >> MR. SECRETARY, MR. CHAIRMAN,  I WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW UP  INITIALLY BECAUSE IN HIS  REMARKS, PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY  CITED A CONVERSATION WITH YOUR  COUNTERPART SAYING THAT HE HAD  CONFIRMED TO HIM THAT IT WAS NOT A UKRAINIAN MISSILE. BASED ON YOUR CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM TODAY, WAS THERE A  DISCONNECT THERE? AND THEN I WILL FOLLOW UP. >> I\\'M NOT GOING TO TALK  ABOUT -- HE AND I OUR AGREEMENT  IS NOT TO TALK ABOUT THE  SUBSTANCE OF THE CONVERSATIONS  THAT WE HAVE. WE HAVE CONVERSATIONS SEVERAL  TIMES A WEEK AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE  THAT WE HAVE THE CONVERSATIONS,  BUT WE DON\\'T DISCUSS THE  SUBSTANCE OF THE CONVERSATION. I HAVE TO HONOR THAT AND I\\'LL  CONTINUE TO HONOR THAT. I CAN TELL YOU THAT RIGHT NOW,  THE INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING. THESE ARE PROFESSIONAL  INVESTIGATORS. THERE IS A DEBRIS FIELD THERE  AND OTHER FORMS OF DATA THAT ARE GOING TO BE AVAILABLE THAT COME  FROM VARIOUS TECHNICAL MEANS. I SUSPECT VERY SHORTLY WE WILL  HAVE VERY CONFIRMED DATA AS TO  WHAT THE POINT OF ORIGIN IS,  POINT OF IMPACT, WHAT ANGLE OF  THE WEAPON SYSTEM WAS, THE  FLIGHT TRAJECTORY, ALL THE  DETAILS WILL BE KNOWN IN DUE  TIME, BUT IT\\'S EARLY IN THE  INVESTIGATION SO WE\\'LL KNOW THAT AND THE SECRETARY WILL KNOW  THAT, PRESIDENT BIDEN WILL KNOW  THAT AND WE\\'LL GET INFORM BY THE INVESTIGATORS AND POLAND HAS PUT TOGETHER A TEAM THEY HAVE LEAD  AND PUT TOGETHER A TEAM OF  INVESTIGATORS TO DO THAT. >> MR. SECRETARY, YESTERDAY IT  WAS KIND OF THE REALITY OF THE  SPECULATION THAT HAS BEEN GOING  ON FOR MONTHS ABOUT HOW NATO  MIGHT RESPOND IF A RUSSIAN  MISSILE WENT INTO NATO  TERRITORY. THE OPPOSITE SIDE, THE UNITED  STATES HAS BEEN CAREFUL NOT TO  PROVIDE WEAPONS SYSTEMS THAT  MIGHT REACH INTO RUSSIA. WHAT ABOUT CRIMEA? IF THE UNITED STATES, SUPPLIED  HIGH MARK SYSTEMS ARE ABLE TO  REACH INSIDE CRIMEA REGULARLY,  IS THAT A CONCERN GIVEN WHAT WE  SAW YESTERDAY AND TO FOLLOW UP,  SIR, TO YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT  EARLIER FROM LAST WEEK ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF DISCUSSIONS PUT  ON BY A SLOW DOWN IN THE  FIGHTING LET\\'S SAY DURING THE  WINTER SOUNDS LIKE THE COMMENTS  YOU\\'RE MAKING TODAY ABOUT THE  WINTER ARE THAT THE UKRAINIANS  ARE GOING TO CONTINUE STRONGLY. ARE YOU PULLING BACK FROM YOUR  COMMENTS FROM LAST WEEK THAT YOU SEE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR  NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE RUSSIANS? >> NO. I THINK THE UKRAINIANS SHOULD  KEEP THE PRESSURE ON THE  RUSSIANS. YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT THEY  MILITARILY CAN. WINTER GETS VERY COLD AND THE  NATURAL TENDENCY IS FOR TACTICAL OPERATIONS TO NATURALLY PROBABLY SLOW DOWN. RIGHT NOW WHAT WE\\'RE SEEING IS  THE LINES FROM KHARKIV ALL THE  WAY DOWN TO KHERSON FOR THE MOST PART ARE BEGINNING TO STABILIZE. NOW WHETHER THAT MEANS THEY WILL BE STABLE THROUGHOUT THE WINTER  OR NOT, NOBODY KNOWS FOR  CERTAIN. COME JANUARY AND FEBRUARY THAT  GROUND PROBABLY WILL FREEZE  WHICH COULD LEND ITSELF TO  OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS. THERE COULD BE A LOT OF ACTIVITY IN THE WINTER BUT TYPICALLY  SPEAKING BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER, THE TACTICAL OPERATIONS WILL  SLOW DOWN A BIT. I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW,  PRESIDENT BIDEN AN PRESIDENT  ZELENSKYY HIMSELF HAS SAID THAT  THERE WILL BE AT THE ENDS OF THE DAY A POLITICAL SOLUTION. IF THERE\\'S A SLOWDOWN IN THE  TACTICAL FIGHTING IF THAT  HAPPENS THAT MAY BECOME A WINDOW POSSIBLY, IT MAY NOT, FOR A  POLITICAL SOLUTION OR AT LEAST  THE BEGINNINGS OF TALKS TO  INITIATE A POLITICAL SOLUTION. THAT\\'S ALL I WOULD SAY.  >> CRIMEA. >> LET ME JUST AGREE WITH WHAT  THE CHAIRMAN JUST SAID IN TERMS  OF THERE IS A -- THERE PROBABLY  WILL BE A SLOW DOWN IN THE FALL  GOING INTO WINTER. THE FALL IS A MUDDY SEASON AND  SO IS THE SPRING. WHEN THE GROUND HARDENS,  TRAFFICIBILITY WILL PROBABLY  IMPROVE AND THEN WE\\'LL BE -- WE  MAY SEE MORE ACTIVITY. I WOULD REMIND EVERYONE THAT  THIS WAR STARTED IN FEBRUARY,  SO, YOU KNOW, WINTER DOES NOT  MEAN THAT WE\\'RE GOING TO STOP  FIGHTING OR THAT THE UKRAINIANS  ARE GOING TO STOP FIGHTING. I CERTAINLY, LIKE THE CHAIRMAN,  BELIEVE THEY WON\\'T. AND SO WE\\'RE GOING TO DO  EVERYTHING WITHIN OUR POWER TO  MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE MEANS TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR GOALS AND  OBJECTIVES. AU LONG THAT LINE, THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THIS FIGHT ARE THE UKRAINIANS. THEY\\'RE NOT OURS. SO WE WON\\'T -- HAVEN\\'T  PRESCRIBED TO THE UKRAINIANS  WHAT THEY CAN AND CANNOT DO. OUR FOCUS IS TO CONTINUE TO  PROVIDE THEM THE MEANS TO BE  SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR ENDEAVORS  AND SO THAT\\'S MY RESPONSE TO THE HE QUESTION ON CRIMEA. CRIMEA IS AN ISSUE TO BE THOUGHT THROUGH AN SORTED OUT BY THE  UKRAINIAN LEADERSHIP. >> LET\\'S GO AHEAD. \"NEW YORK TIMES.\" >> FIRST, GENERAL AUSTIN, WITH  WINTER COMING --. >> IT\\'S A BAD HAPPEN, YOU KEEP  CALLING ME GENERAL. >> SORRY. ENGRAINED IN MY HEAD. >> SECRETARY AUSTIN, DO YOU  AGREE THEN WITH GENERAL MILLEY\\'S COMMENTS IN NEW YORK LAST WEEK  THAT UKRAINE CANNOT AU CLEAVE A  MILITARY VICTORY AS DEFINED BY  DRIVING RUSSIA OUT OF ALL OF ITS TERRITORY, INCLUDING CRIMEA AND  THEREFORE SHOULD USE WINTER AS  AN OPPORTUNITY TO NEGOTIATE? >> AGAIN, HAVING THE CHAIRMAN  HERE, I THINK IT\\'S FAIR TO ALLOW HIM TO REALLY PROVIDE CONTEXT  FOR HIS COMMENTS. I THINK -- AND YOU\\'VE HEARD ME  SAY THIS BEFORE -- THERE ARE  COUNTLESS NUMBERS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN AMAZED AND ASTONISHED  BY WHAT UKRAINIANS HAVE  ACCOMPLISHED AND, SO I WON\\'T  PRESUPPOSE WHAT\\'S -- WHAT\\'S  POSSIBLE OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM. WHAT I AM FOCUSED ON IS MAKING  SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE MEANS TO DO TWO THINGS. FIRST, IS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES  AND THEIR CIVILIAN POPULATION  FROM SOME OF THE THINGS THAT  WE\\'VE SEEN HERE RECENTLY WITH  THE AREAL BOMBARDMENTS. THE SECOND THING IS TO ENABLE  THEM TO ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS AND  OBJECTIVES ON THE GROUND AS THEY CONTINUE TO TRY TO TAKE BACK  THEIR SOVEREIGN TERRITORY. WE\\'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO  SUPPORT THEM. AGAIN, I THINK TO THIS POINT  WE\\'VE SEEN THEM COME UP WITH  VERY ACHIEVABLE GOALS AND  OBJECTIVES. WE\\'VE SEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL  COUNTER OFFENSIVE BOTH IN  KHARKIV AND ALSO IN KHERSON, AND I THINK THEY WILL CONTINUE TO  KEEP THE PRESSURE ON THE  RUSSIANS GOING FORWARD. IN TERMS OF WHAT\\'S A GOOD TIME  TO NEGOTIATE. WE\\'VE SAID REPEATEDLY THAT  UKRAINIANS WILL DECIDE THAT AND  NOT US. WE WILL SUPPORT THEM FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES. NOW, WE JUST SPENT ALMOST FOUR  HOURS WITH OUR COLLEAGUES THERE  IN UKRAINE IN THE DEFENSE  CONTACT GROUP MEETING. IT WAS AMAZING TO ME HOW MANY  MINISTERS OF DEFENSE ON THEIR  OPEN SAID WE\\'RE GOING TO DO THIS FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES. AN, SO I CONTINUE TO SEE UNITY. I CONTINUE TO SEE RESOLVE. THAT\\'S VERY, VERY ENCOURAGING. I THINK IT\\'S ENCOURAGING FOR  ALEXI REZ NA COUGH AND HIS TEAM  AS WELL BECAUSE THEY\\'RE IN THE  MEETING. >> I WILL MAKE A COUPLE  COMMENTS. ON THE RUSSIANS -- >> I STILL HAVE A QUESTION FOR  YOU. >> THAT WILL BE LIKE FOUR  QUESTIONS. >> I HAVEN\\'T ASKED -- >> THIS ONE FIRST. SO -- START WITH THE RUSSIANS. UKRAINE IS A PRETTY BIG COUNTRY. THIS IS NOT A SMALL PIECE OF  TURF. AND THE PROBABILITY OF RUSSIA  ACHIEVING ITS STRATEGIC  OBJECTIVES OF CONQUERING UKRAINE AND OVERRUNNING UKRAINE THE  PROBABILITY OF THAT HAPPENING IS CLOSE TO ZERO. I SUPPOSE THEORETICALLY IT\\'S  POSSIBLE, MAYBE, I GUESS, BUT I  DON\\'T SEE IT HAPPENING  MILITARILY. I DON\\'T SEE THAT HAPPENING. BUT THEY DO CURRENTLY OCCUPY  ABOUT 20% OF THAT -- OF UKRAINE. THEY OCCUPY A PIECE OF GROUND  THAT\\'S ABOUT 900 KILOMETERS LONG AND 75 OR 80 KILOMETERS DEEP. IT\\'S NOT A SMALL PIECE OF  GROUND. THEY INVADED THIS COUNTRY WITH  UPWARDS OF 170,000, 180,000  TROOPS WITH MULTIPLE ARMSS AND  SUFFERED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF  CASUALTIES BUT THEY\\'VE CALLED UP ADDITIONAL PEOPLE. THE RUSSIANS HAVE REINFORCED AND STILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT RUSSIAN  COMBAT POWER INSIDE UKRAINE. NOW UKRAINE HAS HAD GREAT  SUCCESS IN THE DEFENSE. THEY DID A TREMENDOUS JOB IN  DEFEATING THE RUSSIAN OFFENSIVE. IT\\'S INCREDIBLE WHAT THEY WERE  ABLE TO DO. THEN THEY WENT ON THE OFFENSIVE  AT THE BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER AN THEY HAD GREAT SUCCESS IN  KHARKIV AND BETTER SUCCESS IN  KHERSON AS YOU MENTIONED. KHERSON AND KHARKIV PHYSICALLY,  GEOGRAPHICALLY, ARE RELATIVELY  SMALL COMPARED TO THE WHOLE. THE MILITARY TASK OF MILITARILY  KICKING THE RUSSIANS PHYSICALLY  OUT OF UKRAINE IS A VERY  DIFFICULT TASK. AND IT\\'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IN  THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS UNLESS THE RUSSIAN ARMY COMPLETELY  COLLAPSES, WHICH IS UNLIKELY. IN TERMS OF PROBABILITY, THE  PROBABILITY OF A UKRAINIAN  MILITARY VICTORY DEFINED AS  KICKING THE RUSSIANS OUT OF ALL  OF UKRAINE TO INCLUDE WHAT THEY  DEFINE OR WHAT THEY CLAIM IS  CRIMEA, THE PROBABILITY OF THAT  HAPPENING ANY TIME SOON IS NOT  HIGH. MILITARILY. POLITICALLY, THERE MAY BE A  POLITICAL SOLUTION WHERE  POLITICALLY, THE RUSSIANS  WITHDRAW. THAT\\'S POSSIBLE. YOU WANT TO NEGOTIATE FROM A  POSITION OF STRENGTH. RUSSIA IS ON ITS BACK. THE RUSSIAN MILITARY IS  SUFFERING TREMENDOUSLY. LEADERS HAVE BEEN, YOU KNOW,  THEIR LEADERSHIP HAS -- IS  REALLY HURTING BAD. THEY\\'VE LOST A LOT OF CASUALTIES KILLED AND WOUNDED, I WON\\'T GO  OVER THE EXACT NUMBERS, BUT  THEIR TANKS AND FIGHTING  VEHICLES AND HELICOPTERS AND SO  ON. THE RUSSIAN MILITARY IS REALLY  HURTING BAD. SO YOU WANT TO NEGOTIATE AT A  TIME WHEN YOU\\'RE AT YOUR  STRENGTH AND YOUR OPPONENT IS AT WEAKNESS. IT\\'S POSSIBLE, MAYBE, THAT THERE WILL BE A POLITICAL SOLUTION. ALL I\\'M SAYING IS, THERE\\'S A  POSSIBILITY FOR IT. THAT\\'S ALL I\\'M SAYING.  >> OKAY. >> TIME FOR A COUPLE MORE.  >> THANK YOU. GENTLEMEN BOTH FOR DOING THIS. MR. SECRETARY, YOU STRESSED THAT THE UNITED STATES AND THEIR  ALLIES ARE COMMITTED TO UKRAINE  FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES. HOW LONG DO YOU THINK RUSSIA CAN CONTINUE THIS WAR WITH ITS  CURRENT ARSENAL AND PERSONNEL  AND HOW MUCH HAS IRAN EXTENDED  THEIR ABILITY TO WAGE THIS WAR. THANK YOU, YOU ANSWERED MY  QUESTION WITH LOUIE SO I WILL  ASK YOU A QUESTION ON CHINA. AFTER THE MEETING WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN AND PRESIDENT XI, HAVE YOU SEEN ANY INDICATIONS THAT CHINA  HAS CHANGED ITS AMBITION TO  CONTROL TAIWAN AND, YOU KNOW,  THE LAST TIME THAT NATIONAL  DEFENSE STRATEGY WAS ROLLED OUT, THE PENTAGON SAID AMERICA\\'S  MILITARY EDGE WAS ERODING. NOW THAT THIS NEW ONE HAS ROLLED OUT, IS AMERICA\\'S MILITARY EDGE  STILL ERODING TO CHINA? >> SO, THANKS, CARLA. IN TERMS OF HOW LONG RUSSIA CAN  SUSTAIN THEIR EFFORTS, THAT\\'S  LEFT TO BE SEEN. I THINK THE CHAIRMAN JUST GAVE A VERY ACCURATE AND COMPELLING  DESCRIPTION OF KIND OF WHERE THE RUSSIANS ARE RIGHT NOW. THEY HAVE SOME PROBLEMS. THEY\\'VE HAD PROBLEMS SINCE THE  VERY BEGINNING OF THIS TRYING TO SUSTAIN THEIR EFFORTS. THOSE PROBLEMS HAVE BECOME  ACUTE. THEY\\'VE LOST A LOT OF PEOPLE AND AS IMPORTANT, THEY\\'VE LOST A LOT OF IMPORTANT MILITARY GEAR. SO THE NUMBERS OF TAPGS TNKS AN  ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS  PRETTY STAGGERING NUMBERS. AS IMPORTANT THE NUMBER OF  PRECISION GUIDED MUNITIONS THAT  THEY\\'VE RIFLED THROUGH IN THIS  ENDEAVOR, IS STRIKING. BUT THEY WON\\'T BE ABLE TO  REPRODUCE THOSE MUNITIONS  QUICKLY BECAUSE THERE ARE TRADE  RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR -- THAT  PREVENT THEM FROM RAPIDLY  GAINING MICROCHIPS AND OTHER  THINGS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO  PRODUCE THESE KINDS OF MUNITIONS AND SO IT MAY TAKE YEARS FOR  THEM TO RESTOCK THAT INVENTORY  UP TO THE POINT THAT THEY WERE  BEFORE THEY STARTED THIS  CONFLICT. WE\\'VE SEEN THEM STRUGGLE WITH  HAVING ENOUGH MUNITIONS TO FIGHT THE WAY THAT THEY WANT TO FIGHT  SO THEY\\'RE REACHING OUT TO IRAN  AND REACHING OUT TO NORTH KOREA. I DO THINK THOSE COUNTRIES WILL  PROBABLY PROVIDE THEM SOME  CAPABILITY. AND SO FOR THAT REASON, I DON\\'T  THINK THIS WILL BE OVER ANY TIME SOON. OUR, YOU KNOW, OUR GOAL, OUR  REQUIREMENT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE UKRAINE  WITH THE MEANS TO DO WHATEVER  NECESSARY TO PROSECUTE THEIR  CAMPAIGN. THEY HAVE TO CONTINUE TO KEEP  THE PRESSURE ON THE RUSSIANS  GOING FORWARD, AND I THINK, YOU  KNOW, WINTER FIGHT FAVORS THE  UKRAINIANS. WE PUSHED, YOU KNOW, ENORMOUS  AMOUNTS OF WINTER GEAR INTO  UKRAINE, THANKS TO COUNTRIES  LIKE CANADA AND OTHERS WHO HAVE  REALLY BEEN VERY, VERY GENEROUS. RUSSIA, ON THE OTHER HAND,  THEY\\'RE FIGHTING IN A FOREIGN  COUNTRY. THE UKRAINIANS HAVE CHALLENGED  THEIR SUPPLY LINES. IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO GET THE KINDS OF GEAR IN TO  THEIR TROOPS THAT THEY NEED TO  BE ABLE TO FIGHT EFFECTIVELY AND SO I THINK THE UKRAINIANS WILL  HAVE THE UPPER HAND IN THIS  FIGHT AS THEY HAVE RIGHT NOW,  BUT THEY\\'LL CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THAT UPPER HAND GOING INTO THE  WINTER. JUST LIKE WE SAW THEM OPERATE IN FEBRUARY OF LAST YEAR, THEY KNOW THE LAND, THEY CAN PULL THINGS  FROM THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES, AND  THEY\\'LL BE PREPARED FOR THIS  WINTER WEATHER. I DON\\'T THINK THE RUSSIANS WILL  BE AS PREPARED AND THEY WILL  CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE TO GET  THINGS INTO THEIR TROOPS USING  THE SUPPLY LINES THEY CURRENTLY  HAVE. THE UKRAINIANS WILL CONTINUE TO  PRESSURE THOSE SUPPLY LINES. . >> DO YOU THINK THE RUSSIANS CAN HOLD OUT, IF IT TAKES THE YEARS  IT WOULD TAKE TO FULLY RESUPPLY? >> I DON\\'T THINK THE UKRAINIANS  WILL ALLOW THEM TO HOLD OUT. I THINK THE UKRAINIANS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO PRESSURE THEM AND SO THE BATTLEFIELD DYNAMIC WILL  CONTINUE TO CHANGE. THE UKRAINIANS KNOW ALLOWING  THEM TO REST, REFIT AND REARM IS A MISTAKE. OPERATIONAL MISTAKE. I DON\\'T BELIEVE THEY\\'RE GOING TO MAKE THAT MISTAKE. MY GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE THEY  HAVE THE MEANS TO DO WHAT\\'S  NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT THEY  DON\\'T HOLD OUT. . >> YOU HAD TWO QUESTIONS FOR THE SECRETARY, SO I GET A BYE ON  MINE. ON CHINA AS QUICKLY AS I CAN SAY IT, CHINA IS THE PACING THREAT  AS WE DESCRIBE IT IN D.O.D. AS  PART OF THE NATIONAL DEFENSE  STRATEGY. IT WAS DEFINED IN THE PREVIOUS  ONES AND THE CURRENT ONES. WHAT DO WE MEAN BY THAT? CHINA IS THE ONE COUNTRY OUT  THERE THAT GEOPOLITICALLY HAS  THE POWER POTENTIAL TO BE A  SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE TO THE  UNITED STATES. THEY ARE. BASED ON THEIR POPULATION, THEIR TECHNOLOGY, AND THEY\\'RE ECONOMY  AND OTHER THINGS, CHINA IS THE  GREATEST GEOPOLITICAL CHALLENGE  TO THE UNITED STATES. CHINA IS NOT SHY ABOUT THEIR  GOAL. THEY WANT TO BE THE NUMBER ONE  POWER IN THE GLOBE BY  MID-CENTURY, BY 2049. THEY WANT TO DO THAT MILITARILY, DIPLOMATICALLY, INFORMATIONALLY, ECONOMICALLY AND SO ON AND SO  FORTH. THEY WANT TO BE NUMBER ONE BY  MID-CENTURY. BY THE 2030s, MID 2030s, THEY  PREVIOUSLY SAID THEY WANT TO BE  NUMBER ONE REGIONALLY. SO THEY WANT A MILITARY THAT  IS -- THAT OUT DOES THE UNITED  STATES MILITARY BY THE MID 30s. THEY PREVIOUSLY SAID THAT. THEY ADVANCED THAT GOAL TO 2027. THEY ADVANCED THAT GOAL NIANG  THE TWO PARTY OR ONE PARTY  CONGRESS AGO AND WHAT THEY HAVE  SAID IS THEY WANT TO BE THE  EQUAL TO OR SUPERIOR MILITARILY  TO THE UNITED STATES. THAT\\'S ONLY FIVE YEARS AWAY. SO THEY\\'RE WORKING ON THAT AND  THEY\\'RE WORKING ON THAT VERY,  VERY HARD. BUT WE ARE NOT STATIC. WE ARE WORKING ON IT. RIGHT NOW THE UNITED STATES  MILITARY IS, WITHOUT QUESTION,  DESPITE WHATEVER CRITICISMS  PEOPLE HAVE, THE UNITED STATES  MILITARY IS THE MOST LETHAL WAR  FIGHTING MACHINE ON EARTH BAR  NONE. THE UNITED STATES MILITARY IS  NUMBER ONE. WE INTEND TO STAY NUMBER ONE. OUR TASK, MILITARIES ONLY HAVE  TWO TASK, SINGLE PURPOSE REALLY, WHICH IS TO EITHER PREPARE FOR  WAR OR TO FIGHT A WAR. WE ARE LASER FOCUSED ON THAT. WE INTEND TO STAY NUMBER ONE. CHINA IS NOT GOING TO BE A  BETTER MILITARY THAN THE UNITED  STATES MILITARY IS, BUT THEY\\'RE  GOING TO TRY, BUT THEY\\'RE NOT  GOING TO GET THERE. WE WILL BE NUMBER ONE FIVE YEARS FROM NOW, TEN YEARS FROM NOW AND 50 YEARS FROM NOW. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET CHINA  TAKE NUMBER ONE. THEY HAVE MADE GAINS IN A WIDE  VARIETY OF AREAS IN CYBER AND  SPACE AND LAND SAESHG, SEA AND   PEASANT ARMY, LARGELY INFANTRY  BASED. WHEN I WAS COMMISSIONED IN 1980  WHEN THAT\\'S THEY HAD A LARGE  DISMOUNTED INFANTRY, PEASANT  BASED ARMY, MORE OR LESS. SOME TANKS, NOT MUCH. THEN THEY GOT RICH. THEY MADE A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF  MONEY WITH A 10% RISE OVERRUN,  DROP DOWN TO 7%, MAYBE 3 OR 4%,  BUT THE GDP ALLOWED THEM TO BUY  A MILITARY. AND THEY BELIEVE THAT IT\\'S THEIR DAY IN THE SUN. THEY BELIEVE IT\\'S ONCE AGAIN  TIME FOR THE MIDDLE KINGDOM TO  BE NUMBER ONE. SO THAT\\'S WHAT THEY\\'RE SHOOTING  FOR AND WE\\'RE TO THE GOING TO  ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. THE UNITED STATES MILITARY IS  NUMBER ONE AND GOING TO BE  NUMBER ONE FIVE YEARS FROM NOW,  2027 IS NOT GOING TO BE THE DATE THAT CHINA BECOMES NUMBER ONE  AND WE\\'RE GOING TO STAY NUMBER  ONE THE ENTIRE TIME. AS LONG AS WE REMAIN NUMBER ONE  WE\\'LL DO TER THE WAR THAT PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT, A GREAT POWER WAR,  BETWEEN CHINA AND THE UNITED  STATES. AS LONG AS WE HAVE THE MILITARY  CAPABILITY, WE HAVE THE WILL TO  USE IT, YOUR ADVERSARY KNOWS IT  IS TO DETER THAT WAR. WE INTEND TO STAY NUMBER ONE. LE. >> TIME FOR ONE FINAL QUESTION. WE\\'LL GO TO NIKAY.  >> THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY  QUESTION. TO THE SECRETARY, PRESIDENT  BIDEN AND PRESIDENT XI  ESSENTIALLY AGREED TO MAINTAIN  THAT OPEN RISE OF THE  COMMUNICATION. DO YOU EXPECT CHINA WILL REDUCE  MILITARY CHANNELS SUSPENDED IN  AUGUST AFTER THE SPEAKER UPHELD  HIS VISIT TO TAIWAN AND ARE YOU  PLANNING TO MEET WITH YOUR  CHINESE COUNTERPART GUIDING THE  VISIT TO CAMBODIA NEXT WEEK? TO THE CHAIRMAN ALSO ON CHINA,  THE PRESIDENT XI CONSOLIDATED  HIS POWER IN THE CHINA COMMUNIST PARTY AND NOW SURROUNDED BY HIS  LOYAL ADVISORS. HOW MUCH ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT  PRESIDENT XI MIGHT MAKE AN  ILL-ADVISED OR ILL INFORMED  DECISION TO TAKE TAIWAN BY FORCE AS PRESIDENT PUTIN DID IN THE  LEADING UP TO THE INVASION INTO  UKRAINE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  >> THANKS. AS YOU\\'VE HEARD ME SAY A NUMBER  OF TIMES, I THINK IT\\'S REALLY  IMPORTANT FOR LARGE COUNTRIES  WITH SIGNIFICANT MILITARY  CAPACITY TO TALK TO EACH OTHER. AS I TOLD MINISTER WEI WHEN WE  TALKED, WE MET FACE TO FACE IN  SINGAPORE, THAT WE NEEDED TO  WORK TO KEEP THE LINES OF  COMMUNICATION OPEN. THAT HELPS WITH CRISIS  MANAGEMENT. IT HELPS WITH A NUMBER OF  THINGS. AND SO MY HOPE IS THAT THEY WILL OPEN UP THEIR COMMUNICATIONS  CHANNELS NOT ONLY AT MY LEVEL  BUT THE CHAIRMAN\\'S LEVEL AND AT  THE LEVEL WHERE OUR COMBATANT  COMMANDER ADMIRAL AQALINO CAN  ENGAGE WITH HIS COUNTERPARTS AS  WELL. SO YOU\\'RE RIGHT, WE WILL BOTH BE IN CAMBODIA HERE IN THE NEAR  FUTURE. I DON\\'T HAVE ANY ANNOUNCEMENTS  TO MAKE IN TERMS OF ANY  SCHEDULED MEETINGS, BUT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY THERE AND SO  WE\\'LL SEE HOW THINGS PLAY OUT. >> SO I THINK, FIRST OF ALL,  PRESIDENT XI IS -- I DON\\'T KNOW  HIM. I\\'VE NEVER TALKED TO HIM. HE\\'LL MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON  WHAT HE THINKS IS IN HIS  NATIONAL INTERESTS. AS BEST I CAN TELL HE\\'S A  RATIONALE ACTOR. I THINK HE EVALUATES THINGS ON  COST, BENEFIT AND RISK AND I  THINK HE WOULD CONCLUDE AN  ATTACK ON TAIWAN IN THE NEAR  FUTURE WOULD BE AN EXCESSIVE  AMOUNT OF RISK AND END IN A  STRATEGIC REALLY DEBACLE FOR THE CHINESE MILITARY. I THINK IT WOULD THROW OFF THEIR CHINA DREAM OF BEING THE NUMBER  ONE ECONOMIC AND MILITARY POWER  AND SO ON. WOULD HE DO IT? WHO KNOWS. I DON\\'T KNOW. I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE WATCH IT  CLOSELY. WE ARE MILITARILY PREPARED. ONE OF THE KEYS NOW IS TO MAKE  SURE THAT TAIWAN CAN DEFEND  ITSELF AND THERE ARE A LOT OF  LESSONS LEARNED COMING OUT OF  THE UKRAINIAN WAR. THERE\\'S LESSONS LEARNED FOR  TAIWAN, THERE ARE LESSONS  LEARNED THAT WE\\'RE LEARNING,  LESSONS LEARNED THAT THE  EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE LEARNING  AND PRESIDENT XI AND THE CHINESE MILITARY ARE LEARNING. ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE ARE  LEARNING IS THAT WAR ON PAPER IS A WHOLE LOT DIFFERENT THAN REAL  WAR. WHEN BLOOD IS SPILLED AND PEOPLE DIE AND REAL TANKS ARE BEING  BLOWN UP, THINGS ARE A LITTLE  BIT DIFFERENT. THERE\\'S A LOT OF FRICTION AND  FOG AND DEATH IN COMBAT, AND FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS, FOR A MILITARY  THAT HASN\\'T FOUGHT IN COMBAT  SINCE FIGHTING THE VIETNAMESE IN 1979, THEY WOULD BE PLAYING A  DANGEROUS GAME TO CROSS THE  STRAITS AND INVADE THE ISLAND OF TAIWAN. THEY DON\\'T HAVE THE EXPERIENCE  OR BACKGROUND TO DO IT. THEY DO PEACE TRAINING. WE WATCH IT VERY CLOSELY. HOW MUCH AMPHIBIOUS, AIRBORNE  CAPABILITY THEY HAVE IT. THEY COULD BOMB IT, MISSILE IT,  ATTACK TAIWAN IN THAT SENSE, BUT ATTACKING AND SEIZING THE ISLAND OF TAIWAN ACROSS THE STRAITS,  PUTTING TROOPS ON THE ISLAND OF  TAIWAN, THAT IS A VERY DIFFICULT MILITARY TASK TO DO. YOU\\'VE GOT A LARGE CITY OF  TAIPEI WITH 3 OR 4 MILLION  PEOPLE WITH THE SUBURBS OF 7  MILLION, YOU HAVE COMPLEX  TERRAIN WITH MOUNTAINS, MOST OF  TAIWAN IS A MOUNTAINOUS ISLAND. IT\\'S A DIFFICULT MILITARY  OBJECTIVE, A VERY DIFFICULT  MILITARY OPERATION TO EXECUTE,  AND I THINK IT WILL BE SOME TIME BEFORE THE CHINESE HAVE THE  MILITARY CAPABILITY AND THEY\\'RE  READY TO DO IT. NOW THAT COULD BE WRONG. AN INCIDENT COULD HAPPEN. SOME SORT OF POLITICAL THING  COULD HAPPEN AT A MOMENT IN TIME AND ALL OF THE DECISIONS WOULD  CHANGE VERY RAPIDLY. I THINK THAT CHINESE WOULD BE  HIGH RISK TO TAKE ON AN  OPERATION LIKE THAT AND I THINK  IT WOULD BE UNWISE. IT WOULD BE A POLITICAL MISTAKE  A GEOPOLITICAL MISTAKE A  STRATEGIC MISTAKE SIMILAR TO THE STRATEGIC MISTAKE THAT PUTIN HAS MADE IN UKRAINE. . >> SECRETARY? >> I\\'LL BE TRAVELING WITH SOME  OF YOU LATER THIS WEEK INTO NEEK WEEK. FOR THOSE WHO I WON\\'T SEE  BETWEEN NOW AND THANKSGIVING, I  WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO WISH YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES A  HAPPY THANKSGIVING AND ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE  THANKS FOR WHAT YOU CONTINUE TO  DO FOR OUR NATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.',\n",
       " \"and here we are guys the Old Town Square of Krakow\\xa0\\xa0 one of my favorite squares in the\\xa0\\nworld the horses are taking off I was actually walking down that street down\\xa0\\nthere and maybe you guys will be able to relate\\xa0\\xa0 but there's a bunch of like strip clubs down that\\xa0\\nstreet right I must say this is the most beautiful\\xa0\\xa0 time of year to visit however what's up everybody\\xa0\\nwelcome back to a brand new video and a brand new\\xa0\\xa0 country today I'm talking to you guys from Poland\\xa0\\nfrom the beautiful city of krakov honestly one of\\xa0\\xa0 my favorite cities in all of Europe and in this\\xa0\\nvideo you're gonna see exactly why now right\\xa0\\xa0 now I'm walking around the old town but this city\\xa0\\nactually is quite huge there's so many different\\xa0\\xa0 sections and there's a lot to cover however\\xa0\\nin this series I'm going to be spending most\\xa0\\xa0 of my time in the old town because this is where\\xa0\\nall of the touristic areas are this is where all\\xa0\\xa0 the Christmas markets are this is where all the\\xa0\\nhistory is now on every corner you're going to\\xa0\\xa0 run into beautiful architecture such as this\\xa0\\nlittle I believe it's a church not too sure\\xa0\\xa0 and also you're gonna notice that\\xa0\\nas we walk around the city most of the businesses you'll see are gonna\\xa0\\nbe like Cafe restaurants clothing\\xa0\\xa0 shops things of that sort as this is very\\xa0\\nmuch a city that people love to come to\\xa0\\xa0 to do some shopping and of course\\xa0\\nrelax and it's cute coffee shops\\xa0\\xa0 now right now it is roughly one in the afternoon\\xa0\\nand it is getting extremely dark already I've been\\xa0\\xa0 told by the staff at the hotel that we're staying\\xa0\\nat that it starts to really get dark here around\\xa0\\xa0 2 30 in the afternoon during the winter months\\xa0\\nand I can definitely see that being the case no so that you guys can have this in mind it is\\xa0\\nalso one degrees out right now and yesterday when\\xa0\\xa0 we arrived off of the bus I noticed that\\xa0\\nthere was some snow and ice on the ground and here we are guys the Old Town Square of\\xa0\\nKrakow one of my favorite squares in the world wow how beautiful is everything\\xa0\\nright guys I mean look at this place every hour on the hour you'll see a guy with a\\xa0\\ntrumpet come out of the top as the window opens\\xa0\\xa0 and it'll play a little tune and it is absolutely\\xa0\\nincredible that that still happens even right now\\xa0\\xa0 in 2022. now here you're also going to find\\xa0\\na bunch of horse carriages they offer horse\\xa0\\xa0 rides throughout the old town and in my opinion\\xa0\\nit's probably something very nice to do with your\\xa0\\xa0 significant other your children will probably\\xa0\\ngo crazy for it I've personally never done it but the horses here do look like they're\\xa0\\nwell taken care of unlike the horses we saw\\xa0\\xa0 in Morocco a few weeks back wow what a place now\\xa0\\nalong the complete Old Town Square you're gonna\\xa0\\xa0 find a lot of different restaurants like this cute\\xa0\\ncoffee shops where you can just lounge around and\\xa0\\xa0 enjoy the views of the square now this is my\\xa0\\nfirst time ever being in Poland in the winter\\xa0\\xa0 typically during the summer you're going to find\\xa0\\npeople lounging around here drinking their beers\\xa0\\xa0 I don't know how much of that is\\xa0\\ndifferent right now during the winter time\\xa0\\xa0 but I don't see it changing quite too much because\\xa0\\nhere in Poland people love to drink now there\\xa0\\xa0 are Christmas trees here this must be where the\\xa0\\nChristmas Market is I've

this time of year\\xa0\\xa0 but it does look incredibly\\xa0\\nbeautiful you got the Clock Tower where you going bro no it definitely looks a lot busier here than\\xa0\\nit did in Budapest a few days ago the Christmas\\xa0\\xa0 Market definitely has a lot more volume but I\\xa0\\nfeel like that is because the Christmas Market\\xa0\\xa0 is well based off of what I'm seeing just here\\xa0\\nin the main square like in one section and in\\xa0\\xa0 Budapest there was actually many different small\\xa0\\nChristmas markets throughout the city here they're\\xa0\\xa0 all pretty much in the same well everything's\\xa0\\nhappening in the same like General vicinity oh man this is awesome seriously I hope the video portrays the same Vibes\\xa0\\xa0 that I'm feeling just walking around\\xa0\\nhere right now I mean everything is so beautiful so well done the holiday\\xa0\\nspirit is definitely in full effect here\\xa0\\xa0 in Poland and this might be the skinniest\\xa0\\nSanta Claus I've ever seen in my life maybe Santa's are skinny here\\xa0\\nin this part of the world I'm\\xa0\\xa0 not too sure where I come from they're\\xa0\\ndefinitely on the heavier side of things now where we're walking into right now this is\\xa0\\nactually like a small little strip mall reminds\\xa0\\xa0 me of like a Bazaar in Turkey I think we should\\xa0\\ndefinitely come on in here and do a market video\\xa0\\xa0 this week I mean it looks absolutely\\xa0\\nbeautiful as well you can tell they\\xa0\\xa0 definitely decorated the inside of this\\xa0\\nplace [Music] just as they did the outside\\xa0\\xa0 and this here is where you're going to\\xa0\\nfind a lot of different like souvenirs um jewelry bags things of that things of\\xa0\\nthat nature I actually don't think that\\xa0\\xa0 this is very like a local place at all this is\\xa0\\nvery much Ford Taurus but it's cool because you\\xa0\\xa0 need places like this you need a place where\\xa0\\nyou can jump on into purchase your souvenirs\\xa0\\xa0 so you can go home with something\\xa0\\nnice something nice from Poland wow definitely going to be doing some shopping\\xa0\\nnow this is actually the last country that we're\\xa0\\xa0 visiting this trip so I'm gonna load up on all\\xa0\\nkinds of souvenirs I actually bought a suitcase\\xa0\\xa0 in Paris to load up with a bunch of things that we\\xa0\\nbuy along the way but let me just be honest it's\\xa0\\xa0 completely full with winter clothes but since I\\xa0\\nam going back to Southern California after this\\xa0\\xa0 I might just have to leave all of that winter\\xa0\\nclothes behind oh man good memories here and crack\\xa0\\xa0 off you know I got a funny story to share with\\xa0\\nyou guys in 20 when was it 2017 when I first came\\xa0\\xa0 here I was actually walking down that street down\\xa0\\nthere and maybe you guys will be able to relate\\xa0\\xa0 but there's a bunch of like strip clubs down that\\xa0\\nstreet right or at least there was before the hold\\xa0\\xa0 thing came around and just ruined everything but\\xa0\\nthere was a bunch of strip clubs down there and in\\xa0\\xa0 2017 I was walking with some buddies I met in the\\xa0\\nhostel and we're getting drunk having a crazy time\\xa0\\xa0 and as I was walking down that street there was\\xa0\\npeople like handing out like these small little\\xa0\\xa0 cards with strip club uh information trying to get\\xa0\\nyou inside of the strip club but I didn't want to\\xa0\\xa0 actually go into them because the people at the\\xa0\\nhostel told me that they had a huge problem with\\xa0\\xa0 um tourists getting drugged inside of the strip\\xa0\\nclubs you answer they put something in your drink\\xa0\\xa0 you end up leaving with a credit card that is\\xa0\\njust charged out the ass and you end up paying\\xa0\\xa0 for it right so I was kind of telling them like\\xa0\\nno no no it was this Russian guy who was working\\xa0\\xa0 there no no no no and then he's like where are\\xa0\\nyou from I tell him that's how I found out then\\xa0\\xa0 I asked Cameron that's how I found out he's\\xa0\\nfrom Russia and we started talking I thought\\xa0\\xa0 he was going to be cool then out of nowhere he\\xa0\\nsticks the card that I keep telling them I don't\\xa0\\xa0 want into my shirt because I was wearing\\xa0\\na shirt with the collar and a small pocket\\xa0\\xa0 and I was like dude what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] I told you I\\xa0\\ndo not want to go into your strip club and then\\xa0\\xa0 he pushed me he's like he's like um why are you\\xa0\\nbeing rude and I'm like I'm not being rude you're\\xa0\\xa0 being rude you're disrespecting me I already told\\xa0\\nyou I don't want to enter right man next to you\\xa0\\xa0 know dude pepper sprayed me me and my boy Vinnie\\xa0\\nwe start swinging oh man police came it was a huge\\xa0\\xa0 deal I was pretty wasted luckily the cops came and\\xa0\\nthey're like yeah what they're doing is illegal so\\xa0\\xa0 sorry that that happened to you um they handcuffed\\xa0\\na guy I got to leave but it ruined our damn night\\xa0\\xa0 because we were so wasted and I was pepper sprayed\\xa0\\nall over the face and it hurt so bad if you've\\xa0\\xa0 never been pepper sprayed oh my God it is the\\xa0\\nworst feeling in the world you do not want it\\xa0\\xa0 to happen to you and yeah that was just one of the\\xa0\\nmany

started\\xa0\\nbringing their shop key yeah it's very cold\\xa0\\xa0 freezing weather this was one of my favorite\\xa0\\nevents last year this is something that is\\xa0\\xa0 absolutely unique to Krakow all of these\\xa0\\nthings we see under the Adams Monument is\\xa0\\xa0 our cribs a crib baby Jesus cribs but done\\xa0\\nin the most ornate way you can imagine and these designs are meant to it's a competition\\xa0\\nalso so there's uh requirements about what\\xa0\\xa0 the shop key should have so they're meant to\\xa0\\nincorporate elements of Krakow in the design\\xa0\\xa0 ten o'clock it's starting so the the competition\\xa0\\nis done in different age groups there'll be kids\\xa0\\xa0 models but there'll be people who have like\\xa0\\nspent all year making these things and their\\xa0\\xa0 absolute works of art so it's a wonderful\\xa0\\nChristmas event unique to this city [Music] yeah so you can see some of the shop key are tiny and they'll be smaller than\\xa0\\nthis one and then some of them pretty big getting on a meter meter and a half and people will be here who don't know\\xa0\\nwhat's happening and there's people who will come every year to see this\\xa0\\nthing special if you're in the\\xa0\\xa0 now and Krakow this is one of the\\xa0\\nmost Christmassy things I think now it's 10 o'clock a few of the most ornate models are\\xa0\\nalready here I think they bring them early\\xa0\\xa0 because they're very delicate if you're\\xa0\\nwalking past a lot of people and stuff you\\xa0\\xa0 know you don't want to be breaking your\\xa0\\nmodels that you've worked all year on\\xa0\\xa0 but by The End by 12 o'clock there will be shopky\\xa0\\nall over the base of the monument there'll be\\xa0\\xa0 there'll be dozens dozens of them so over the next\\xa0\\nhour or two we'll see a steady stream of people oh hey hey I I've made the smart because\\xa0\\nthis is normal for me that's the normal\\xa0\\xa0 one that's not a normal one amazing and this\\xa0\\nis uh something something in the egg I think\\xa0\\xa0 yeah it's not a uh is that a real eggshell this\\xa0\\nis a real eggshell I I just I just play with that\\xa0\\xa0 so delicate it's

them\\xa0\\xa0 up close but this is better because you see them\\xa0\\nit's it's exciting because everybody's presenting\\xa0\\xa0 them today hold yourself we should see we should\\xa0\\nsee a whole bunch of kids bringing theirs later on it's a very crackout themed event\\xa0\\nunder the Marriott Under The Monuments\\xa0\\xa0 and if you look carefully are they incorporate elements to crack out\\xa0\\nlook at the towers on the crib and the steeple and again so very creative how they take elements\\xa0\\xa0 elements of the city now I want you to\\xa0\\nbe the Mariachi it can be uh see the Dome reminds me of this so elements\\xa0\\nof the city Incorporated sometimes they get pretty creative last year last year when we when you go to see\\xa0\\nthe museums a lot of these have mechanical Parts\\xa0\\xa0 you're going to see all the characters rotating\\xa0\\naround lights it's really incredible works of art [Music] what happens if we could see people\\xa0\\nbringing their shop key they register them\\xa0\\xa0 I think we started they present them\\xa0\\nyou don't you don't get this in the\\xa0\\xa0 museum if you go to the museum you'll\\xa0\\njust see them sitting in the case but

       " 'although Poland hosts one of the tiniest Muslim\\xa0\\nminorities in the whole world you have Muslim\\xa0\\xa0 families who have been settled in Poland since\\xa0\\nthe 14th century, so it is, at the same time, one\\xa0\\xa0 of the oldest Muslim minorities in Europe. hello\\xa0\\nand welcome my name is William and today I wanted\\xa0\\xa0 to share with you about Muslims in my parents\\xa0\\ncountry, Poland. when I embraced Islam in 2008 my\\xa0\\xa0 parents would still go to Poland visit family.\\xa0\\nI needed to figure out where I\\'m gonna pray,\\xa0\\xa0 where I\\'m gonna find a mosque or halal meat\\xa0\\nthen I stumbled upon the Wikipedia page and\\xa0\\xa0 I thought to myself: \"I didn\\'t know that\" and I want\\xa0\\nto tell the word about this. I decided back then to\\xa0\\xa0 produce my very first documentary which you can\\xa0\\nfind for free on YouTube called polish Muslims\\xa0\\xa0 and unexpected meeting. back then, the main\\xa0\\nright-wing narrative was that Muslims are not\\xa0\\xa0 welcome in Europe because they were never part of\\xa0\\nit. they do not belong to Europe. the fact that you\\xa0\\xa0 have Muslims settled in Poland since the 14th\\xa0\\ncentury was a magnificent counter-argument. when\\xa0\\xa0 I went to meet Muslims in Poland, I went to three\\xa0\\ndifferent areas. I went of course to the capital\\xa0\\xa0 city Warszawa, then I went to Katowice which is\\xa0\\nin Slask, in Silesia, which was a very\\xa0\\xa0 industrial region of Poland and the birthplace\\xa0\\nof my dad, eventually I went to Bialystok in\\xa0\\xa0 the northeastern part of the country. Muslims\\xa0\\nin Poland are made of three main\\xa0\\xa0 demographics. first the largest population is made\\xa0\\nof all different kinds of people who arrived in\\xa0\\xa0 Poland in the 20th century: people from North\\xa0\\nAfrica the Middle East and later on West Africa,\\xa0\\xa0 Turkey, South Asia and also lots of Muslims\\xa0\\ncoming from the Kawkas: Dagestan, Chechnya and so\\xa0\\xa0 on. and thanks to them, Poland has become the first\\xa0\\nand largest exporter of halal meat across Europe.\\xa0\\xa0 second are the numerous Poles who embraced Islam\\xa0\\nat some point in their lives. Third are the Tatars\\xa0\\xa0 this is the oldest Muslim Community in Poland.\\nTatars are tukric people who originated from Crimea\\xa0\\xa0 and came to Poland in the 14th century to offer\\xa0\\ntheir military services to the Duke of Poland\\xa0\\xa0 Lithuania at the time. To thank them for their\\xa0\\nservices, the Duke of Poland Lithuania, Prince\\xa0\\xa0 Witold, offered the Tatars land and the right to\\xa0\\npractice their religion. since then, you will find\\xa0\\xa0 in the northeastern part of Poland so around\\xa0\\nthe city of Bialystok mosques and Cemeteries\\xa0\\xa0 which are 300 400 years old and have very distinct\\xa0\\nlook. the highlight of my trip was meeting with the\\xa0\\xa0 tatars obviously because the first thing is when\\xa0\\nyou look at the mosques, the way they are built, is\\xa0\\xa0 very similar to the way people used to build \\xa0\\nchurches. the rituals might differ a little bit\\xa0\\xa0 from what people are used to see in Western Europe,\\xa0\\nfor example is the concept of sadoga. I went to\\xa0\\xa0 Poland for Ramadan and I spent Eid in in Poland\\xa0\\nand at that time after the Eid khutba (sermon) people would\\xa0\\xa0 leave sweets on the minbar on the mosque, and this\\xa0\\nis called sadoga which comes from the word sadaqa\\xa0\\xa0 you may have guessed. Because of Communism many\\xa0\\nTatars had to hide their religiosity to the point\\xa0\\xa0 where people even adopted Christian sounding names\\xa0\\nto hide for example Ali would become Alexander and\\xa0\\xa0 like many Muslims you would find in Central Asia\\xa0\\npart of the ex-communist block countries, for many\\xa0\\xa0 people Islam has now become nothing more than a\\xa0\\ncultural heritage so you will see people who are\\xa0\\xa0 proud to be Muslim but people who are also happy\\xa0\\nto drink some vodka. and there was a point because\\xa0\\xa0 of Communism where these historic mosques would\\xa0\\nopen only 14 times a year twice for Eid and 12\\xa0\\xa0 times because there was one Juma per month.\\xa0\\nand thanks to the influx of migrants from the\\xa0\\xa0 Middle East and other parts of the world now the\\xa0\\nyounger Generations are starting to reconnect with\\xa0\\xa0 their faith and tradition so you would see younger\\xa0\\ntatars who wear the hijab for example, while it was\\xa0\\xa0 not the case for their parents generation. when\\xa0\\nit comes to other groups of Muslims and because\\xa0\\xa0 there is very few mosques in Poland what was\\xa0\\nheartwarming is unlike some Western European\\xa0\\xa0 countries, in the mosque you would find a huge\\xa0\\ndiversity of people people from very different\\xa0\\xa0 cultures, ethnicities, social economic backgrounds.\\xa0\\npeople speaking all sorts of languages and the\\xa0\\xa0 khutba would be in Polish. sadly you will have\\xa0\\nsome political divisions when it comes to the\\xa0\\xa0 representation of Muslims in Poland specifically\\xa0\\nbetween the Muslim League which is made of people\\xa0\\xa0 who mainly arrived in Poland in the 20th century\\xa0\\nso the majority and group of Muslims and between\\xa0\\xa0 the Tatars who claim a right for representation\\xa0\\nbecause they are the oldest demographic of Muslims\\xa0\\xa0 in Poland. also the Tatars are an officially\\xa0\\nrecognized minority by the government and every\\xa0\\xa0 year there is a commemoration of their military\\xa0\\nservices to the country. and since I\\'ve made my\\xa0\\xa0 documentary in 2012, 2013 things have changed\\xa0\\nin Poland and and the far right has taken over\\xa0\\xa0 with a very strong anti-muslim narrative and\\xa0\\nshortly after I left I read the news and so\\xa0\\xa0 the mosques being burned people being attacked\\xa0\\non the streets so life has become slightly more\\xa0\\xa0 difficult for Muslims in Poland. one striking\\xa0\\nexample of how people try to go low profile\\xa0\\xa0 now is this kiosk this small Kebab shop in the\\xa0\\ncenter of Warszawa which was called \"salaam alaikum\\xa0\\xa0 kebab\" and I thought back in the days, that was\\xa0\\nreally really a bold idea to call your Kebab\\xa0\\xa0 shop like this in the middle of Warszawa and then so\\xa0\\nI\\'ve returned to Warszawa last year and in the in\\xa0\\xa0 the center of the city and now salaam alaikum\\xa0\\nKebab has become hello Kebab. if you want to\\xa0\\xa0 know more about Muslims in Poland I invite you\\xa0\\nto have a look at this documentary I produced\\xa0\\xa0  now 10 years ago which is freely available on\\xa0\\nYouTube polish Muslims documentary just type in on\\xa0\\xa0 YouTube it will appear in the meantime thank\\xa0\\nyou for watching and take care of each other',\n",

WE LOOKED AT WHAT IS THE STATE WE LOOKED AT WHAT IS THE STATE OF UNDERSTANDING ABOUT DID RUSSIA FIRE THE MUNITION THAT IS SAID TO HAVE CAUSED THE DEATH OF TWO POLISH RESIDENTS. HE SAID IT IS UNLIKELY BUT THERE IS INFORMATION TO CONTEST THAT BASED ON THE TRAJECTORY. BUT, HE IS NOT TELLING US HOW HE KNOWS THAT., BUT IT DOES RAISE MORE QUESTIONS. IF IT IS NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF RUSSIA, THEN, CERTAINLY, IT WOULD TAKE THE ISSUE OF THE NATO CASE AND PUT IT INTO A DIFFERENT CATEGORY. COULD IT BE SOME KIND OF OTHER ACCIDENT?\\nWE WILL HAVE TO FIND OUT. WE WILL HAVE TO FIND OUT. THAT IS WHY WE OFTEN HEAR THE INVESTIGATION NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE. THE PRESIDENT ALSO TALKED ABOUT IT WILL FORCE US TO LOOK AT THE TOTALITY OF WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING FROM RUSSIA WITH THE ONSLAUGHT OF RUSSIAN ATTACKS ON CITIES IN UKRAINE AS A PART OF THE OVERALL CONVERSATION HERE.\",\n",
       " \"today we're in the beautiful baltic city of\\xa0\\nGdańsk and we're going to be exploring around\\xa0\\xa0 this stunning place with you guys today so\\xa0\\ncome along with us right now i am in front\\xa0\\xa0 of this beautiful statue of neptune and he is\\xa0\\nlooking pretty heroic if you don't mind me saying\\xa0\\xa0 and it's a beautiful emblem for this incredible\\xa0\\ncity because it does have such an expansive\\xa0\\xa0 maritime history and both of us are very\\xa0\\nexcited to check this place out it's been\\xa0\\xa0 it's been on both of our lists now for quite\\xa0\\nsome time literally since we got to poland we\\xa0\\xa0 were like we need to go and explore the tri-cities\\xa0\\nand a lot of you guys have commented saying that\\xa0\\xa0 we needed to come up here so that's exactly why\\xa0\\nwe're here let's go and explore beautiful Gdańsk so right now we are in Długi Targ where you have\\xa0\\nthe beautiful statue and fountain of neptune and\\xa0\\xa0 this really seems to be one of the main tourist\\xa0\\nattractions here you can hear loads and loads\\xa0\\xa0 of different languages i think we have never\\xa0\\nseen so many tourists and so many english speakers\\xa0\\xa0 german speakers french speakers and so on in\\xa0\\nall of poland so i think Gdańsk is one of the\\xa0\\xa0 most popular cities here in poland and here\\xa0\\nfrom Długi Targ you can have a beautiful view\\xa0\\xa0 onto the old town hall and which at the moment\\xa0\\naccommodates a museum and you can even go\\xa0\\xa0 all the way up to the tower so maybe\\xa0\\nthat's something that we're going to do\\xa0\\xa0 just to get a little bit of\\xa0\\na better overview of the city all right guys so we just got our tickets for\\xa0\\nthe tower in the old city hall of Gdańsk and we're\\xa0\\xa0 going to make our way up now to this tower it\\xa0\\nsupposedly has some of the best views that you can\\xa0\\xa0 get over Gdańsk so let's go and do it literally the\\xa0\\nsecond we made it up to tower and the sun came out\\xa0\\xa0 before it was a little bit cloudy here and there\\xa0\\nbut now it's beautiful sunshine and oh my god let\\xa0\\xa0 me tell you something it's so beautiful up here\\xa0\\nyou can see so incredibly far into the distance\\xa0\\xa0 it kind of feels like you get a whole overview\\xa0\\nof poland basically from here and all you can\\xa0\\xa0 see are those beautiful red tile roofs of the old\\xa0\\ncity itself and you can even see very far into the\\xa0\\xa0 distance kind of the cranes of the port and so on\\xa0\\nso this is definitely a worthy start of the video\\xa0\\xa0 my god the views are just absolutely mind-blowing\\xa0\\ni cannot get over the panoramic 360 views that\\xa0\\xa0 you get when you get towers like this the last\\xa0\\nplace that we had this was in Toruń and it was\\xa0\\xa0 simply spectacular as well this one i think is\\xa0\\na little bit higher than the tower in Toruń\\xa0\\xa0 we definitely had to walk up a whole bunch of\\xa0\\nsteps and we were severely out of breath for quite\\xa0\\xa0 some time but the views are very very much worth\\xa0\\nevery single penny it is around 12 złoty per person\\xa0\\xa0 to get up here for this view and definitely\\xa0\\ndo it if you do get the chance while you're\\xa0\\xa0 here in Gdańsk because it offers a stunning view\\xa0\\ndown over Długi Targ or the long market street\\xa0\\xa0 you can see down very clearly all along the\\xa0\\nstreet you can see the people bustling about\\xa0\\xa0 and it is just absolutely amazing well well well\\xa0\\nworth it from this tower here as well you get this\\xa0\\xa0 stunning view over to saint mary's basilica which\\xa0\\nis the largest red brick church in all of poland\\xa0\\xa0 and as you can see here i even saw some people\\xa0\\non the top of that tower so maybe we can go over\\xa0\\xa0 there and check out that tower as well because it\\xa0\\nseems to be a little bit higher than the one of\\xa0\\xa0 the old town hall but yeah you get this stunning\\xa0\\nview and you can really appreciate how beautiful\\xa0\\xa0 the basilica stands here in Gdańsk the\\xa0\\nstreets of Gdańsk are characterized by this\\xa0\\xa0 beautiful cobblestone walking through these\\xa0\\nstreets you are really reminded of the history\\xa0\\xa0 of this baltic port city a lot of it was sadly\\xa0\\nflattened during world war ii but since then\\xa0\\xa0 obviously a lot of it has been rebuilt to look\\xa0\\nsimilar to the way it did before that war and you\\xa0\\xa0 can see a lot of the history as i said in these\\xa0\\nbeautiful streets we just had a look around saint\\xa0\\xa0 mary's basilica here in Gdańsk and oh my god it's\\xa0\\nso so stunning from the inside it's completely\\xa0\\xa0 white um i think i've never seen that actually in\\xa0\\na church that it's completely white on the inside\\xa0\\xa0 just with like golden accents everywhere so it's\\xa0\\nbeautifully decorated from the inside it looks\\xa0\\xa0 very peaceful very uplifting and you can indeed\\xa0\\ngo up the tower of saint mary's basilica as well\\xa0\\xa0 i believe it was 14 złoty to go up but we just came\\xa0\\ndown the other tower so we don't want to go up\\xa0\\xa0 another 82 meters of staircase and so we're maybe\\xa0\\ngoing to do that later or tomorrow on our own time we just had to take some cash out we just arrived\\xa0\\nto the beautiful river Wisła here in Gdańsk and\\xa0\\xa0 we're gonna go and try and get ourselves a\\xa0\\nboat the boat leaves now in approximately\\xa0\\xa0 five minutes so we should you should be able\\xa0\\nto catch this one stress stress stress stress\\xa0\\xa0 but yeah there's plenty of different types of\\xa0\\nboats that are just floating around have a look but this one over here is the one that\\xa0\\nwe are trying to catch so let's go let's go now if you're coming here\\xa0\\non a day where the weather\\xa0\\xa0 changes quite a bit make sure that you bring\\xa0\\na jacket or maybe even a rain poncho because we\\xa0\\xa0 just got absolutely soaked in rain so so\\xa0\\nwet right now it is just pummeling rain\\xa0\\xa0 out of the sky so we came here this seems to\\xa0\\nbe like an exchange of people getting off and\\xa0\\xa0 on so we came up here to get a seat under the\\xa0\\nroof of the upper deck and thankfully we did\\xa0\\xa0 the seat is still absolutely soaked though but\\xa0\\nit's it's fine it will be good the views all\\xa0\\xa0 along here are just amazing yeah and depending on\\xa0\\nhow full the ship is as well you might not even\\xa0\\xa0 get a place under the roof so that's why we kind\\xa0\\nof got wet for a while because we had to stand\\xa0\\xa0 outside without the roof this this boat as\\xa0\\nwell is it goes from Gdańsk to Westerplatte\\xa0\\xa0 which is kind of where world war ii actually began\\xa0\\nit was the first clash first battle between poland\\xa0\\xa0 and germany in world war ii so crazy amount\\xa0\\nof history and all along here you see so many\\xa0\\xa0 beautiful things like the Gdańsk shipyard where\\xa0\\nthey repair boats coming in and out of Gdańsk it's\\xa0\\xa0 so cool it's amazing so right now you can even see\\xa0\\none of the larger boats that have been for repair\\xa0\\xa0 in Gdańsk being pulled out by several smaller\\xa0\\nboats it kind of looks like maybe three\\xa0\\xa0 or four smaller boats are pulling it out into the\\xa0\\nbaltic sea which is super super interesting to see that boat experience was\\xa0\\none of a kind definitely\\xa0\\xa0 two thumbs up from us it also stopped raining\\xa0\\nthe second we touched ground again so yeah\\xa0\\xa0 literally as soon as the boat trip was over\\xa0\\nit stopped raining but throughout the entire\\xa0\\xa0 throughout the entire trip on the boat itself it\\xa0\\nwas just lashing down really really heavily rain\\xa0\\xa0 so we spent the majority of it trying to look for\\xa0\\ncover on the boat but nonetheless we captured some\\xa0\\xa0 really nice footage for you guys and that boat\\xa0\\ntrip is definitely worth every second now we're\\xa0\\xa0 getting pretty hungry so we're gonna go and\\xa0\\ntry and find a nice restaurant to get some food\\xa0\\xa0 here in beautiful Gdańsk let's go these buildings\\xa0\\nover here are really really interesting looking\\xa0\\xa0 it kind of reminds me and naomi of the\\xa0\\nSpeicherstadt which we saw in hamburg\\xa0\\xa0 not too long ago you'll probably use these\\xa0\\npeople with balloons are everywhere as well\\xa0\\xa0 they have just these giant long strings\\xa0\\nof balloons and me and naomi have been hit\\xa0\\xa0 in the head multiple times we got smacked in the\\xa0\\nface with balloons several times but yeah those\\xa0\\xa0 buildings are really interesting and we went to\\xa0\\nhamburg made like a little bit of a stop over\\xa0\\xa0 there and it looks like the Speicherstadt area in\\xa0\\nhamburg so that's really interesting so we made\\xa0\\xa0 our way into a milk bar it's actually called milk\\xa0\\nbar Stągiewna and it seems to be incredibly popular with\\xa0\\xa0 a lot of polish people around here have a look\\xa0\\naround the restaurant right now it's absolutely\\xa0\\xa0 packed we have no idea what we're going to order\\xa0\\nbut we're just going to pick something at random\\xa0\\xa0 off the menu and then we're going to go and enjoy\\xa0\\nsome food you can find milk bars pretty much all\\xa0\\xa0 over poland and to be honest these are usually our\\xa0\\nfavorite restaurants because you are guaranteed to\\xa0\\xa0 get a pretty large meal for a very small amount of\\xa0\\nmoney just to give you an example we just got two\\xa0\\xa0 kotlet schabowy which is pretty much schnitzel\\xa0\\nwith with some potatoes and dill on the side\\xa0\\xa0 and we paid 48 złoty in total which is like around\\xa0\\n10 euro and for two huge meals which is absolutely\\xa0\\xa0 amazing those two meals were really really tasty\\xa0\\nas well so in case you do come to Gdańsk make sure\\xa0\\xa0 to check out this milk bar here and just to give\\xa0\\nyou a little bit of context with the milk bars as\\xa0\\xa0 far as we understood the milk bars are kind of a\\xa0\\nleftover of communism itself so those were usually\\xa0\\xa0 the types of places where you could get a large\\xa0\\nmeal for a little amount of money right yeah and\\xa0\\xa0 the name itself as far as i'm aware the name milk\\xa0\\nbar comes from cheese curd or cheese leftovers\\xa0\\xa0 and that was because in the times of communism\\xa0\\nmeat itself was very rare and difficult\\xa0\\xa0 to come by and it all kind of ties in together\\xa0\\nthis is exactly why we tried to find ourselves\\xa0\\xa0 a milk bar to visit here in Gdańsk because Gdańsk\\xa0\\nitself was where the fall of communism started in\\xa0\\xa0 poland which is pretty magnificent and yeah milk\\xa0\\nbars perfect place to go if you do want to spend\\xa0\\xa0 just a little bit of money but you want to fill\\xa0\\nup your tummy something that we like to do on\\xa0\\xa0 our channel every now and then as well for you\\xa0\\nguys especially for our polish viewers is to\\xa0\\xa0 give you guys exactly what a certain place looks\\xa0\\nlike during a certain time so we just turn the\\xa0\\xa0 camera around and give you the raw and other feel\\xa0\\nof what the place is currently like at the moment\\xa0\\xa0 and today it is a relatively rainy wednesday\\xa0\\nhere in Gdańsk but we may as well show you guys\\xa0\\xa0 what the beautiful long market or Długi Targ\\xa0\\narea looks like here in Gdańsk so check it out oh we are such children we walked past\\xa0\\nthe sweet factory store called the dansk\\xa0\\xa0 sweet factory and we decided to go in and get\\xa0\\nourselves some pick and mix very first time\\xa0\\xa0 actually we managed to walk past these types\\xa0\\nof stores for one and a half years and today\\xa0\\xa0 was just a day where we were like okay we need\\xa0\\nto go and grab ourselves some candy we gave in initially we were planning on taking you to the\\xa0\\nbaltic sea right now but because the weather is\\xa0\\xa0 only so-so and we made the decision to\\xa0\\ncome to this mall here which is called\\xa0\\xa0 forum check this out they have a little\\xa0\\nriver inside of the mall how cool is that i'm sure however that we will be taking you to\\xa0\\nthe baltic sea in the next two videos because\\xa0\\xa0 one of them is going to be from sopot and the\\xa0\\nother one is going to be from gdynia right yeah\\xa0\\xa0 we are in the tri cities and this is our first\\xa0\\nstop of the tri-cities beautiful Gdańsk and we\\xa0\\xa0 cannot wait to check out the other two that mall\\xa0\\nforum Gdańsk is a really interesting and unique\\xa0\\xa0 mall the architecture in there is just something\\xa0\\nelse and we've never seen a mall like that that\\xa0\\xa0 just has a river cutting through the mall all\\xa0\\nreally interesting and plenty of things to check\\xa0\\xa0 out there we just went in because it started\\xa0\\nraining once again unfortunately the weather\\xa0\\xa0 is not on our side today but speaking of shopping\\xa0\\nGdańsk is known as the amber capital of the baltics\\xa0\\xa0 so there's plenty of places to you can go and get\\xa0\\nyourself beautiful amber souvenirs all over this\\xa0\\xa0 amazing city by the way here in Gdańsk and all over\\xa0\\npoland and the larger cities really you find these\\xa0\\xa0 crazy super malls pretty much everywhere but\\xa0\\nnot only one of them usually several ones of\\xa0\\xa0 them so for example here in Gdańsk we just went to\\xa0\\nthat forum mall but there's also a mall very very\\xa0\\xa0 close to us which i believe is called the galeria\\xa0\\nbałtycka or something like that which is equally\\xa0\\xa0 large like so big that you can genuinely get lost\\xa0\\nin there so in case you do forget something when\\xa0\\xa0 you have when you get to poland there's always the\\xa0\\noption to stock up on stuff that you might need alright guys so great thing to know if you are\\xa0\\ngoing to be coming and staying in Gdańsk there is a\\xa0\\xa0 tram that connects a lot of the city and we are\\xa0\\nstaying in an airbnb that's just outside of Gdańsk\\xa0\\xa0 so that saved us quite a bit of money if you do\\xa0\\nwant to stay directly in the center obviously\\xa0\\xa0 it's going to be a little bit more money so we\\xa0\\nended up getting a place just outside of Gdańsk and\\xa0\\xa0 saved ourselves a good bit so we are just using\\xa0\\nthe tram now to get back to our accommodation\\xa0\\xa0 but yeah this is this was our kind of quick\\xa0\\nfirst impression of Gdańsk city of Gdańsk\\xa0\\xa0 and it is absolutely a beautiful place 100 worth\\xa0\\nvisiting in my personal opinion what do you think\\xa0\\xa0 i couldn't agree more with you i feel\\xa0\\nlike Gdańsk has a very very unique\\xa0\\xa0 charm to it especially the architecture\\xa0\\nand the river itself and even the boat cruise that\\xa0\\xa0 we did today even though the weather was not\\xa0\\ngreat it was an absolutely unique experience\\xa0\\xa0 and i do recommend for you to do that as\\xa0\\nwell even though the weather might be bad\\xa0\\xa0 but yeah guys for now my name is luke my name\\xa0\\nis naomi and we are the two mod explorers and\\xa0\\xa0 this is your reminder to keep exploring i will see\\xa0\\nyou guys in the next video thanks for watching bye\",\n",
       " '- Today, I\\'m going house hunting for the very first time in my life. This is interesting. (upbeat music) And guess what? I\\'m house hunting in the\\nmountains of Southern Poland. There\\'s a magic here. So today I get to check out some really interesting properties, ranging from the very\\nrundown to the very plush. But will any of them\\nturn out to be the one? This place is one in a million. Here\\'s a bit of context. Over the last year or so, I\\'ve been dreaming of\\nfinding a place to call home. And originally I imagined that to be in the Western United States. Last year when I spent a month in Montana, I just felt so at home. I really felt like that was my place. But given the craziness of the\\nreal estate market in the US, I kind of gave up on that dream. And honestly, that\\'s a\\npretty hard reality check. So last week, I shipped my\\nentire life back to Europe, including my truck, all my\\nstuff, and my dog, Vilk. Hey buddy, does Europe smell different? So, I guess that means\\nI\\'m kind of committing to finding something out here. (foreign language) Let\\'s see if I can find my dream\\nproperty in the Motherland. Yes, I wanna have something\\nequally traditional, but. Well, welcome to Poland. I am Polish, in case you didn\\'t know, although, I haven\\'t lived\\nhere in over 20 years. I moved away when I was a kid and spent most of my life in the UK. And to be completely honest with you, I didn\\'t think I\\'d ever\\ncome back, not to live here, or at least, not to try and\\nfind a place to live here. But here we are in my search for a home, I have come to the Carpathian\\nMountains in Southern Poland, one of the most magical places in Europe. And today I\\'m gonna see if I can find a place to potentially call home. (Eva laughing) Isn\\'t that kind of crazy? Isn\\'t that just so wild, that\\nI could live here, maybe? (car engine starting) I knew exactly who to call upon to learn more about life in the mountains. They\\'ve been living\\nhere for over 10 years, and in that time they\\'ve managed to build a true slice of heaven,\\nlargely by themselves, but they started out\\nwith just a ruined barn, little money and a big dream. Here, I brought them a gift\\nall the way from Montana. Hope they enjoy it. - Wow. - This is Gorna Chata. A small boutique hotel\\nthat Kasia and Leszek lovingly built on the\\nside of this mountain over the last decade. It\\'s so hard to describe in words the level of silence and serenity I feel every time I come to visit them. If I could move in here\\ntomorrow, I probably would, (Eva laughing) but since that\\'s not really an option, I\\'ll have to find my own oasis. And I still think this is one\\nof the most magical places in all of Europe, if not the world, the Carpathian Mountains. It\\'s, yeah, probably my favorite\\nspot on the continent. You know, it\\'s kind of\\nfunny how this is really such a gem and it\\'s kind\\nof still a hidden gem. I mean, in Eastern Europe, you know, people know about the\\nCarpathian Mountains, but out west, nobody\\nknows about this place, which is what makes it so\\nspecial and so pristine, still. (calm music) And I think that\\'s why\\nI would like to come and maybe live here, because\\nit still feels wild. Since I came here for the\\nfirst time two years ago, I have just been completely in love with what Kasia and\\nLeszek have created here. And quite honestly, I kind of wanna use some of\\ntheir ideas as inspiration for my future home. So I\\'m gonna go and\\ncheck out their cottages, which are for rent, by the way, and see what I like about them. \\'Cause man, this is like, this place is one in a million. It\\'s incredible. (serene music) This kind of bathtub, oh yes. Okay, but the best part about this cottage and the one that I find most inspiring is this upstairs area. (serene music) Oh my God, I remember sitting\\nhere in this very hammock two years ago and thinking about how much I wanna make a\\nplace like this my home. Someday you\\'ll see me\\nmaking videos about building a wooden hut in the forest. And now I\\'m back and I\\'m\\nactually looking around. (serene music) So, this living room here is,\\nobviously, absolutely huge. And I probably wouldn\\'t need\\na dining table this big, but I just love the like earthy feel here. I love all the decor. I love how light it feels. There\\'s so much light coming in. I love the fairy lights,\\nobviously, they\\'re so cute. Okay, so then, they\\'ve\\ngot this beautiful terrace with a tree growing\\nthrough the middle of it. How cool is that? You know, there\\'s a\\nmillion holiday cottages and home designs out there that, you know, are really beautiful and\\nluxurious and that look natural, but Kasia and Leszek, I\\nthink can teach me a lot about like how to integrate\\nnature into my future house. They\\'re like all about\\nsustainability, truly and deeply. They\\'re about unique design\\nand, you know, they\\'re vegan. They have animals that they\\ntake care of here on this land, but you know, that don\\'t work or anything. I\\'m happy to have them as teachers. So I\\'m gonna go and ask\\nthem some questions about what it\\'s like to live here and whether my dream of possibly building a house here is actually realistic. It might give me a reality check, but I need to know. I need to know. (upbeat music) But before we get into the hot tub, a quick word from the\\npartner of this video and one of my ultimate\\ntravel hacks, Surfshark VPN. Today we\\'re gonna learn\\nabout the advantages of using Surfshark VPN with Vilk. Hey buddy, did you say you\\nhad some questions about VPNs? (dog grunting) (upbeat music) Well, buddy, since we travel so much, we\\'re usually using hotel and Airbnb wifi, and there\\'s really no way to know whether any of those\\nnetworks are actually safe. They do give us a sense of false security, but they could actually be\\nhiding many different privacy and security threats. Got it? Still following? (dog grunting) So if you ever use\\nunfamiliar wifi networks to make online purchases or access any kind of personal data, including online banking, you could be compromising your privacy. So to prevent that, I\\njust turn on Surfshark VPN and it keeps my location secret and encrypts, basically\\nsecures, all of my online data. (dog panting) Yes, I\\'m glad you asked. So Surfshark allows you to access content and content streaming services\\nfrom all around the world. For example, if you wanna watch reruns of your favorite show, but it\\'s not available\\non the Netflix catalog in your country, you can just switch locations\\nand look in another country. For me, that\\'s definitely \"The Office\". Oh, I guess he doesn\\'t\\nknow what \"The Office\" is. Well, I think I\\'ve got something that you might like in the UK. (wolf howling) Well, we\\'ve already got our Surfshark VPN, so we\\'re good to go. And you guys can also benefit\\nfrom a Black Friday deal. Just go to this link, enter\\nmy promo code, evazubeck and enjoy up to six months of free VPN. I also left the link in\\nthe description box below. Oh, and by the way, there\\'s a\\n30 day money back guarantee, so there is really no\\nrisk in trying it out. Well, safe to say that\\nKasia and Leszek gave me just the push I needed to get out there and start seeing some actual\\nproperties in the area. But before going totally\\nin on the wild idea, I wanted to see what\\'s out there. And the first property I\\'m going to visit is this ruin of a\\nmountain hut in the woods. It looks like this is the\\nroad that the hut is on, and if it\\'s true, then\\nthat means that the hut is really close to the main road, which is a bit of a bummer. I kind of, I wanted to go somewhere a little bit more remote, but let\\'s see, let\\'s check it out. Maybe I\\'m wrong. Okay, this is not it. But I was told that I\\nshould go across this plot and into the woods, somewhere over there. When I called a real estate\\nagent about this place, she said that these buildings\\nhere will be taken down because the person that built\\nthem didn\\'t actually have a building permission. So, yeah, that sucks. (intense music) Okay, I think I see the hut. It\\'s right here. Oh my God. (Eva laughing) This is, this is interesting. (intense music) Hey buddy, do you like it? It\\'s absolutely gorgeous. It\\'s a traditional Polish,\\nCarpathian Mountain hut, built in the traditional style. You know, this is the kind of hut that shepherds would\\'ve lived in, and you still see a lot of these buildings all around this region. So, I don\\'t have the keys because\\nthe real estate agent said I could just look inside to see for myself the state of the place. Huh. Yeah. Wow. That\\'s bad. (Eva giggling) That\\'s so, so bad. Nah, absolutely not. I mean, it\\'s, it is a ruin, but I think that\\'s almost secondary. The main thing is the hut is right next to a\\nreally busy, really loud road, and it is $125,000 for a very\\nsmall plot of land and a ruin and a really bad location. I mean, seeing it, I\\'m like, yes, I wanna have something\\nequally traditional, but hearing it,\\n(Eva giggling) I also know that I just\\nwanna be as far away from roads as possible. So, yeah, this bacowka is not for me. Let\\'s get outta here, buddy. (serene music) I would say that this property here, was like on the lower end\\nof the spectrum for me. As in, I would only invest\\nin renovating a mountain hut if it had like a really\\nspectacular location, you know? Then I might think about it, but this is not it, so. There\\'s a few more places\\nI wanna check out though, so all isn\\'t lost. Let\\'s go and see them. After seeing this bacowka or mountain hut, I thought back to what Kasia and Leszek shared with me earlier. This next house I\\'m about to see is very, very, very different. I\\'m kind of excited to see it. The villa we\\'re about to see is definitely way out of my price range, but you know, it can\\'t hurt to see a\\nbeautiful mountain home for some inspiration. This is a very plush,\\nturnkey villa overlooking the Podhale Mountains. This house is so beautiful. (serene music) (Eva sighing) Oh my God, such a dream. (serene violin music) Okay, wow, I can already see it\\'s so huge. So this is the living room and there\\'s a pretty small kitchen here, and it\\'s all just decked out\\nin this beautiful natural wood. And this fireplace, also super traditional\\nPolish old-school style and I definitely want\\none of those in my house in the future. All right, well, let\\'s check it out. It\\'s pretty huge, so, we better get going. So there\\'s an office here downstairs, which is very lovely. Okay, room number one. Room number two, three, and room number four. Okay, I guess this is the master bedroom. So nice. And here is one of the bathrooms. What is that? (Eva giggling) Oh my God, is this like a, oh my God, it\\'s like a sit-in sauna. That is wild. But this is not everything, there\\'s also like a whole basement area. Room number 85, room number (door opening) 86, room number 87. Oh, what\\'s this? It\\'s locked. (Eva knocking) That\\'s kind of creepy, like the entrance to a secret tunnel or a torture chamber or something. (door closing) I think I wanna get outta here now. Well, this house is such a dream house. The architecture is so perfect. It\\'s exactly how I would\\nwant my future house to look, but this is not the one because it\\'s way too big. It\\'s so huge. I don\\'t even need a building\\nhalf this size, you know? I mean, yes, there is a beautiful view, but only if you look that way. If you look to the right and to the left, you\\'ve got neighbors and the garden is very small. So for about four, just over $400,000, nah, this is not the one. Knowing the price and\\nthe size of this villa I thought back to what Kasia\\nand Leszek shared with me when we met up. Well, let\\'s recap. Renovating a total ruin\\nnext to a busy road, uh, not an option. A plush turnkey mansion with an epic view but loads of neighbors and too much space and also too expensive, not an option either. But there\\'s one more. Okay, here we are, this is the last house that I\\'ll be seeing today. It\\'s a bit of a wild card, I\\'ll admit, but I was just really curious to see what it would be like to live\\nin the middle of a village in a really beautiful historic house. So, let\\'s see. (serene music) If you can ignore my\\nshoddy camera work here, that would be very appreciated, thank you. This house has been standing on its own and abandoned for almost 30 years, and in that time, nobody\\nhas paid the light bills. It was a strange mix of the\\ntwo properties I saw earlier. A bit of a ruin, yet retaining some of that\\ntraditional mountain grandeur with beautiful wooden interiors, those dreamy Eastern European\\nstoves and fireplaces, and clearly, a lot of work ahead for anyone willing to invest in it. There\\'s even a little side house, what we might traditionally\\ncall an (foreign language) in Polish. A small room with many functions and sometimes, a whole\\nfamily living inside it. I mean, such a cool\\nidea to like go in there and restore a house like that, but I won\\'t even know\\nwhere to begin, you know. That is just such a huge project. And the house is in the middle of village, which I didn\\'t quite appreciate. So it\\'s not really the kind of, you know, natural oasis that I\\'ve been dreaming of. So, not the one. None of those three\\nhouses were quite right. So far, I wasn\\'t finding\\nanything even remotely realistic, but then again, I wasn\\'t really expecting to find anything right away. Instead, I was hoping to use\\nthis as a learning experience, you know, to see what\\'s even out there. And here are my biggest takeaways. A traditional architectural\\nstyle, yes, a big yes. A great view, another yes. Ah! A big plot of land, yep. Neighbors, nope. Size, you know what they say about size. No, but seriously, something\\nsmall will suffice. Well, I loved seeing all three properties and learning more about what\\nI liked and didn\\'t like, but for now, winter is quickly arriving in the Polish mountains and that is not a good time\\nto house hunt out here. The snow gets serious. So I\\'m gonna keep my eyes peeled\\non the real estate websites and hopefully come back\\nin a couple of months to see if anything else has popped up. But for now, I am headed south, much further south,\\ntowards warmer weather.

       " \"Hello friends today we talk about very important subject from my point of view what is the most than euro thing in Poland I am from another country so many things in Po in Poland people think it's europeo for me it's very very Weir and the UN Euro weed what country you from China China Asian country the culture are so different so I have a lot of culture shock I'm going to tell you this today and since today's video is a talking video we have to prepare some drink yeah leer okay I'm prepared today all right like French people they bring their wine everywhere and German people take their people a beer everywhere Polish people take vertica everywhere this is not Li we don't have vka we take liquor everywhere so this is a caramel taste lior right and it's a gift from our friends usually we don't drink aloh at home and it's interesting to try polish Le because they have different tast let's try this [Music] first it's quite good nice okay so let's start our first first point what is the very unur in Poland I think Polish people are are not afraid of coldness they don't feel what did I say ah so let's start talk about are you drunk Polish people we soow little to clothes you know I observe that through the whole year except for the hottest days I always wear two times three times more cloth more clothes than Polish people in the street like 10° I still see people walking with a sh so I I always wear a lot of clothes and at the same time my husband this one he he always say so hot so hot thinking oh my God what's wrong with him and and especially in the night my feet are so cold and I have to hug him to steal heat from him but he's like a like a heat ball is always and me it heat so it's good that we have something I don't need any I don't need the hot water what what is it called that you know you can put the hot water inside this thing and hold this the kindest people like it so so in other words your shock is that I'm hot you and many other people you didn't try other people do I have to try I can see that they when I'm shaking in the coldness they don't feel anything okay they have a very thin blouse and and short [Music] t-shirt so let's talk about the second thing so second thing for me I think it's weird to see at films movies from from another country at the Polish people will make it lectors they call it the lect so it's like the movie are in original sound but there is a person a man a male voice reading the Polish subtitle there are no subtit without emotion that's very weird very weird for me like I cannot get used to this so it's not a dabbing there is original sound yes original dialoges yeah can hear them in language but besides of this there is a Polish lecto talking in Polish there are no subtitles in Polish yeah sometimes they are writing so so I don't I don't know what Polish people listen listen to the people who are talking or people listen to the movie they listen to know to polish Lector so it's really really weird I never heard of this before I came to Poland okay okay next one next one is that no the Polish post shop they say all different kinds of small things books souvenirs toys and children toys Children books it's hard to recognize which one is the major business for me not it's not it's not it's like a shop it's not hard to recognize anymore these are shops literally right now they also soap and shampoo and I don't know all type of nonsense umbrellas they are shops and by the way still sometimes you can send a letter there that's really weird because you know everything's so colorful and where I'm going to send my letter what I'm going to what am I doing there a magic word for children well I believe that children will be very happy to go there and it's like a Chinese shop the Chinese shop is also interesting in Poland we see everywhere there are Chinese shop and and before I enter one I imagine that I can find a lot of Chinese or Asian food or ingredients there spices whatever but they have nothing they have nothing related to food they sell clothes or small items tools and many other things but there's no food this is very we for me you know yeah in China there is a city very famous it's called e they produce trippy the all those small items I I think that this Chinese shop is just a copy of the city it's so interesting yeah so I don't know how important this Chinese shop is to p polish people's everyday life I've never been there in my entire life and other Polish people do you you really buy things there I have no idea but there are so many of these shops that I don't know they have to sell something right another shop I hope they are Che okay the next one next one I forgot I have to think about it next thing is that Polish people celebrate their name day they have a calendar of the names and which day they could celebrate it's like a birthday but more important than the birthday right many people don't celebrate birthday but they celebrate name day yeah so I can but my name is not on the calendar so I cannot celebrate my name day another very unur thing for me that maybe it's it's um more about a person or it but I have to say many Polish people think it's very polite to take over shoes if you visit somebody's home you go to other people home and they take all their shoes so let me ask you you go there and the host provide you a slipper will you will you wear the slipper I this is a problem of hyg personal Hy so so what people do in China in this situation wait wait wait I have to finish this so so if the person provide so if the house provide you a slipper and you think I don't want to wear the slipper that other people wear in this case you have to walk with your bare foot on the floor or you have a socks yeah but same I I feel like if there's no shoes like I'm walking with a bare food so on one hand it's very cold on the other hand if the host the same work without show then it's okay but if they have a showe at home but I have to work without a show it's very weird I feel like I am what walking cleaning clothes that wherever I go I clean there it's really really weird yeah it would not happen usually oh yeah it doesn't fit for all the people because the GU the guys they can always take their own you know sleepers when they go to visit somebody yeah you do like this yes why not well maybe it's for closer people if you take your shes to more you know decent colleague does it look [Music] weird no not so much oh in China people noway people really don't care too much where that you wear your showes in their home if they can they will provide you a plastic in this this what what is the name of this in English plastic BS protection yeah protection plastic protection for your shoes yeah just a simple one pretty one you wear once and you throw it away kind show so you can protect and at the same time sleep parade you can use that or in closa family they'll provide you a king sleeper sleeper and usually for example like my uncle each time the gas went away they will clean the sleeper sleeper yes they will do it that's not so bad so mostly if if we want our guest take off shows then it's it's for closer people like family member so like a normal friends and we will not ask people to take our shoes Okay okay so I think that's it's already Five Points that it's very weird for me in Poland how do you think about it should see okay leave your comment below and then watch our videos and subscribe byebye you have to finish it [Music] not\",\n",

       " \"Poland's historic presidential palace\\nand a banquet given tonight in honour of the Queen by \\nPresident Kwaśniewski, a former communist who succeeded Lech Wałęsa \\nlast November amid considerable bitterness.

We strongly support the enlargement of \\nthe European Union and of NATO. We welcome your aspirations \\nto join these institutions. Earlier, somber\\nreminders of the Holocaust. The Queen and Prince Philip\\nwent to the site of a station from which 300,000 Jews were \\ntransported to Nazi death camps. A ceremony added after British Jews\\ncriticised the fact there'll be no visit to the most notorious camp, \\nAuschwitz, in southern Poland. British officials insist there simply\\nisn't time for the Queen to go there. I wish that every human being\\nwould visit Auschwitz, but certainly I'm very grateful\\nthat the Queen is visiting here, the Umschlagplatz,\\nand paying tribute. It's not that she doesn't know, but \\nthe impression that visit Auschwitz makes could be strong and perhaps \\nhave some consequences.

       " \"I've just found out that during World War II\\xa0\\nPoland sent their declaration of war to Japan\\xa0\\xa0 because they were on opposite sides but Japan\\xa0\\nrefused it okay I'm confused so let's find out\\xa0\\xa0 a little bit more in today's video Jin do let's go\\xa0\\nwhen you make a formal declaration of war the last\\xa0\\xa0 thing you expect is for it to be rejected but this\\xa0\\nis what happened to Poland during World War II\\xa0\\xa0 when its government in Exile declared war in Japan\\xa0\\nthe Japanese refused to accept this declaration as\\xa0\\xa0 valid and thus promptly ignored it which raises a\\xa0\\npretty obvious question why why did Japan refuse\\xa0\\xa0 to acknowledge that Poland was at war with it so\\xa0\\nDuring the interwar period Japan and Poland had\\xa0\\xa0 very good relations this was due to their Mutual\\xa0\\ndislike of the Soviet Union and the two Nations\\xa0\\xa0 cooperated deeply in conducting Espionage within\\xa0\\nthe USSR well I never I didn't even realize that\\xa0\\xa0 there was even a link between Poland and Japan I I\\xa0\\ndidn't you know there quite quite far away on the\\xa0\\xa0 world scale of things um their cultures are well\\xa0\\na lot different so I never realized that those two\\xa0\\xa0 countries now I know this video is a simplified\\xa0\\nversion obviously uh it's a short anim animated\\xa0\\xa0 documentary but it'll tell hopefully the gist\\xa0\\nof things without getting into stupid amounts\\xa0\\xa0 of detail but I never knew there was any form of\\xa0\\nlink between you know Japan and Poland you know\\xa0\\xa0 throughout history you know there's um countries\\xa0\\nthat have special relations like the UK and us\\xa0\\xa0 for some reason um you know there are different\\xa0\\ncountries that are friends and it's quite obvious\\xa0\\xa0 why they're friends a lot of the Scandinavian\\xa0\\ncountries they you know they work together and\\xa0\\xa0 you that makes sense Poland and Japan okay let's\\xa0\\nsee what else happened Japanese listing stations\\xa0\\xa0 were located within Poland and polish spies\\xa0\\nwere smuggled in and out of the USSR by the\\xa0\\xa0 vast Japanese puppet state of manchukuo however\\xa0\\nas you all know the Japanese allied with the\\xa0\\xa0 Germans during the second world war and its Ally\\xa0\\nconquered Poland the Japanese deeply disapproved\\xa0\\xa0 of this in part because their close Ally had just\\xa0\\nbeen wiped out but also because Germany had done\\xa0\\xa0 this in tandem with the USSR which the Japanese\\xa0\\ngovernment viewed as its greatest threat that said\\xa0\\xa0 there wasn't anything that it could do about\\xa0\\nthe destruction of Poland and so the Japanese\\xa0\\xa0 simply said nothing at least publicly privately\\xa0\\nJapan supported the Polish government in London\\xa0\\xa0 and the two continued to spy on the USSR together\\xa0\\nof course at this point Japan wasn't at war with\\xa0\\xa0 the Western Powers but when this changed in 1941\\xa0\\nthe Polish government in Exile declared war in\\xa0\\xa0 Japan like their hosts so the Japanese response\\xa0\\nwas simple no we're not actually at War it's I\\xa0\\xa0 think I think Japan I think in times of War you\\xa0\\nhave to pick a side and you have to pick a side\\xa0\\xa0 on um who who your kind of your country's beliefs\\xa0\\nsort of align most with and also who you think is\\xa0\\xa0 going to win as well right because there's no\\xa0\\nlook I I appreciate I appreciate um you should\\xa0\\xa0 always you know you should always do it for the\\xa0\\nmoral side of things but if you join a side that\\xa0\\xa0 you think is probably going to lose even with\\xa0\\nyour help then that's not the right thing for\\xa0\\xa0 your people so I don't know enough about the\\xa0\\nJapan joining the war with Germany um but it's\\xa0\\xa0 putting this in a light of it was a tough decision\\xa0\\nthat actually they didn't necessarily agree with\\xa0\\xa0 everything the Germans did and maybe they didn't\\xa0\\nknow to what extent the Germans were doing things\\xa0\\xa0 um but obviously they had this relationship with\\xa0\\nPoland that they didn't agree you know that that\\xa0\\xa0 Germany were basically trying to wipe them off\\xa0\\nthe face of the Earth but they clearly knew the\\xa0\\xa0 danger of speaking out against Germany and then\\xa0\\nwhat became the Soviets and later on and things\\xa0\\xa0 like that and yeah probably a tricky position\\xa0\\nfor them to be in main justification was that\\xa0\\xa0 the Polish government in Exile wasn't free to\\xa0\\ndo as it chose and was at this point a client\\xa0\\xa0 of the British acting under immense pressure\\xa0\\nfrom the Americans thus as far as the Japanese\\xa0\\xa0 were concerned the Polish didn't really want to\\xa0\\ndeclare war on their old allies and friends don't\\xa0\\xa0 let friends declare war on Friends against their\\xa0\\nwill of course the Japanese also viewed countries\\xa0\\xa0 like Australia New Zealand India and Canada in the\\xa0\\nsame light but they accepted their Declarations\\xa0\\xa0 of War and the reason for that was proximity\\xa0\\nPoland was half a world away and unable to do\\xa0\\xa0 anything whereas the others could project forces\\xa0\\nnear enough to Japan to cause a potential issue\\xa0\\xa0 also they sat where Japan wanted to expand her\\xa0\\nEmpire another issue was that whilst they wished\\xa0\\xa0 to continue working with the Polish in order to\\xa0\\nspy on the USSR they didn't want to upset their\\xa0\\xa0 German allies too much and acknowledging the\\xa0\\ndeclaration of war would also be acknowledging\\xa0\\xa0 that a Poland still existed so after the ignored\\xa0\\ndeclaration of war what happened well nothing the\\xa0\\xa0 Polish couldn't do anything against Japan because\\xa0\\nthey had much more pressing issues closer to home\\xa0\\xa0 and when Japan surrendered to the Allies Poland\\xa0\\nwasn't at the Ceremony this was because during\\xa0\\xa0 negotiations with the USSR the Western allies had\\xa0\\nagreed to stop recognizing the Polish government\\xa0\\xa0 in Exile as legitimate and so after this where\\xa0\\nnormal relations were restored between Japan\\xa0\\xa0 and the Allies in 1951 Poland's representative\\xa0\\nwas the head of the Polish People's Republic a\\xa0\\xa0 communist state which Japan was not a fan of and\\xa0\\nthe two held no formal relations until 1957 this\\xa0\\xa0 was when Japan acknowledged communist rule there\\xa0\\nas legitimate and also sought of maybe made peace\\xa0\\xa0 despite not really ever having been to war just to\\xa0\\nsort of get things over with a fantastic Channel\\xa0\\xa0 honestly they do some really good stuff and it's\\xa0\\nmeant to be bite-sized right so there's things\\xa0\\xa0 there that I didn't actually realize so uh like\\xa0\\nI said I didn't realize at how close Japan and\\xa0\\xa0 Poland were in a relationship before World War\\xa0\\nII and then it does make me think like I said\\xa0\\xa0 about how Japan they probably had tricky tricky\\xa0\\ndecisions to make uh you know yes I think they\\xa0\\xa0 clearly believed the Germans were going to win\\xa0\\nthe war that obviously didn't work so like I\\xa0\\xa0 said you've got to pick a side if you're going to\\xa0\\njoin a war uh and you don't want to pick a side\\xa0\\xa0 that you think is going to lose and clearly they\\xa0\\nthought the Germans were going to win but then you\\xa0\\xa0 know they were friends with the polls who thought\\xa0\\nscrew you you are joining the Germans and we know\\xa0\\xa0 the relationship or the previous relationship\\xa0\\nat least between poles and the Germans um it's\\xa0\\xa0 not been healthy for for years and then the so\\xa0\\nas well come into the mix a real mess I would\\xa0\\xa0 like to know what the relationship is like now\\xa0\\nbetween Poland and Japan if you're polish um\\xa0\\xa0 what do you think of the Japanese do you realize\\xa0\\nthat there there was or even is a relationship a\\xa0\\xa0 possible working relationship between the two\\xa0\\ncountries it just seems strange because like I\\xa0\\xa0 said they're not exactly close you can understand\\xa0\\nfor example why the United Kingdom and Australia\\xa0\\xa0 have a relationship because that was the United\\xa0\\nKingdom's penal colony colony and that's where\\xa0\\xa0 we sent um all the convicts and things so you can\\xa0\\nunderstand that but what is the link why why other\\xa0\\xa0 than you know the Soviets why did Poland and Japan\\xa0\\nwork pretty closely together before World War II\\xa0\\xa0 it leaves me of a few questions but did answer\\xa0\\nI suppose well I said it answered some questions\\xa0\\xa0 it told me some things I never knew about so\\xa0\\nthere we go I wonder if you knew about this\\xa0\\xa0 did you know about the close relationship between\\xa0\\nPoland and Japan let me know down in the comments\\xa0\\xa0 an interesting one for you today make sure you\\xa0\\nlike And subscribe and I'll catch you next time

       " \"- What are your favorite things about Warsaw? -\\xa0\\nFirst of all the people are very ambitious and\\xa0\\xa0 creative and I feel like I'm surrounding myself\\xa0\\nwith people that want to get stuff done in their\\xa0\\xa0 life number two this city never sleeps I'm finally\\xa0\\nin a place where even on a Monday or a Tuesday you\\xa0\\xa0 can go to an amazing party and just live your\\xa0\\nlife to the fullest not just on a Friday - I\\xa0\\xa0 Love The Nightlife here because you can find\\xa0\\nwherever you want you can find history places\\xa0\\xa0 more fancy ones I love as well the restaurants the\\xa0\\nquality of food here the people the girls as well Vitam z Warszawy! There\\xa0\\nbehind me have one of the iconic\\xa0\\xa0 buildings in the city the Palace of Culture\\xa0\\nand you just heard from three opinions\\xa0\\xa0 from three different nationalities that\\xa0\\nyou're going to meet a lot here in Poland\\xa0\\xa0 if you come in 2023 so let's get into it five\\xa0\\nreasons to come to Poland this year let's go! So reason number one is the\\xa0\\nprice level here in Poland\\xa0\\xa0 here in Warsaw as in many cities with a number\\xa0\\nof refugees who have come from Ukraine in the last\\xa0\\xa0 year there is a little bit of a higher premium\\xa0\\nfor central rent in the capital but in general\\xa0\\xa0 it is a standard price level for Eastern Europe\\xa0\\nso depending where you live in the West it could be\\xa0\\xa0 even a third of the price I would say it's about\\xa0\\nyeah half the price here of say London or Paris,\\xa0\\xa0 a Dublin, a Munich for example a Stockholm maybe\\xa0\\nit's even a bit cheaper than that so you'd have\\xa0\\xa0 that great value for money here in Poland compared\\xa0\\nto what you're going to expect to pay if you're in\\xa0\\xa0 North America or in Western Europe for a big city\\xa0\\nbecause this city is around 2 million people in\\xa0\\xa0 population and it's obviously a capital of a European\\xa0\\ncountry number two reason is the dating not\\xa0\\xa0 only do you have the pretty Poles here in Poland\\xa0\\nyou also have a lot of single girls who've come\\xa0\\xa0 tragically obviously with the war in Ukraine to\\xa0\\nPoland there's I think still a million Ukrainians\\xa0\\xa0 who came as refugees in the country and actually\\xa0\\nprior to that there was already a big Ukrainian\\xa0\\xa0 diaspora here on top of that you have a lot\\xa0\\nof young people who've come from Belarus so\\xa0\\xa0 you have a lot of beautiful Belarusians as well\\xa0\\nwho are here so definitely in terms of dating\\xa0\\xa0 compared to Western Europe or North America it\\xa0\\nis very attractive for guys here for sure perhaps\\xa0\\xa0 not quite as attractive as further Eastern Europe\\xa0\\nbut still lots of great dating opportunities and\\xa0\\xa0 as most of my viewers are single guys definitely\\xa0\\ngoing to be of great interest here reason number\\xa0\\xa0 three is the variety of cities in Poland because\\xa0\\nright up in the north you have the seaside so you've\\xa0\\xa0 got Gdańsk which is a pretty cool city then you\\xa0\\nalso you've got mountains you can even go skiing\\xa0\\xa0 in the south of Poland and you obviously have a\\xa0\\nbig cosmopolitan capital like Warsaw you also\\xa0\\xa0 have student towns like Lublin where else have\\xa0\\nyou got you've got Poznań so Łódź you have just\\xa0\\xa0 a lot of different options in Poland because\\xa0\\nit is a significantly big country in Europe\\xa0\\xa0 has population about 40 million and different\\xa0\\ntopography and size of cities and yeah whether\\xa0\\xa0 they're student towns or college town or they're\\xa0\\na big cosmology couple like War so you definitely\\xa0\\xa0 have a good bit of diversity here so that is\\xa0\\nsomething that's great in Poland and then reason\\xa0\\xa0 number four is the level of English here compared\\xa0\\nto the other options in Eastern Europe the level\\xa0\\xa0 of English is pretty high it's almost as high\\xa0\\nas in Scandinavia and the Netherlands I would\\xa0\\xa0 say in Wars saw at least Education First they rate\\xa0\\nEnglish language proficiency as a foreign language\\xa0\\xa0 across the globe and Poland is actually in the\\xa0\\ntop tier at this stage it's definitely the level of English\\xa0\\xa0 is very high you will not have problems talking to\\xa0\\npeople in general with a few exceptions so that is\\xa0\\xa0 something that's good if you're going to talk\\xa0\\nthen to the Belarusians or Ukrainian diaspora\\xa0\\xa0 they also tend to speak basic English but it will\\xa0\\nbe a little bit less because English is not as\\xa0\\xa0 widely spoken in their countries so of course if\\xa0\\nyou speak the local language if you learn Polish\\xa0\\xa0 I've seen it with my French friend who's been\\xa0\\nhere who does speak some Polish it makes a big\\xa0\\xa0 difference you will move out of the tourist box\\xa0\\nand people who are going to be polite enough to\\xa0\\xa0 you if you speak in English in the restaurants and\\xa0\\nthe bars if you chat to people socially if you're\\xa0\\xa0 talking to local girls but if you can learn some\\xa0\\nPolish it will make a significant difference I\\xa0\\xa0 have seen it because you move out of that tourist\\xa0\\nbox because very few guys actually learn Polish\\xa0\\xa0 who come here from other countries on top\\xa0\\nof it if you speak Russian or Ukrainian or Belarusian\\xa0\\xa0 for those diasporas then it's also going to be\\xa0\\na big advantage but basically compared to the\\xa0\\xa0 other countries in the east of Europe this\\xa0\\nis of course Central Europe should state Poland is\\xa0\\xa0 in central but it is the eastern part of Central\\xa0\\nEurope but compared to the countries further east\\xa0\\xa0 the level of English is dramatically better here it is not\\xa0\\nfar off being in Sweden or the Netherlands or yeah\\xa0\\xa0 countries were really they almost speak better\\xa0\\nEnglish than me and then finally I would say\\xa0\\xa0 fifth reason is the level of the infrastructure\\xa0\\nbecause it had been a good few years since I\\xa0\\xa0 have been back in Poland and I notice that the\\xa0\\ninfrastructure has just gotten better and better\\xa0\\xa0 really there's for me here in Warsaw is there\\xa0\\na big difference between being here and been in\\xa0\\xa0 the cities big metropolises further to the West\\xa0\\nlike being in Berlin or Munich or London or Paris\\xa0\\xa0 in terms of infrastructure? Not very much really\\xa0\\nPoland's economy has been so strong over the last\\xa0\\xa0 15 years at least they didn't even have I think an\\xa0\\neconomic recession in that in 2008 as a result of\\xa0\\xa0 the economic collapse everywhere else around the\\xa0\\nglobe and it's just gone from strength to strength and\\xa0\\xa0 you see that they have invested a lot of money\\xa0\\nin their infrastructure with airports and just\\xa0\\xa0 the the public transport here is great I think\\xa0\\nin Warsaw I've been very impressed by it and you\\xa0\\xa0 obviously have trains going across Europe as well\\xa0\\nso pretty yeah I mean this is the West it's the\\xa0\\xa0 eastern part of the West it's the eastern part of\\xa0\\nCentral Europe it is not a third world country\\xa0\\xa0 whatsoever it is first world here in Poland so\\xa0\\nthat is something that is a good reason to come\\xa0\\xa0 if you're looking for a little bit more of the\\xa0\\nyou know a comfortable environment also crime at\\xa0\\xa0 least in the center of Warsaw from what I've seen\\xa0\\nis very low I don't feel insecure walking around\\xa0\\xa0 at all at night here in the center it seems pretty\\xa0\\nsafe there are a lot of police actually out so\\xa0\\xa0 yeah I just think for the overall experience\\xa0\\nPoland pretty pretty impressive at the moment\\xa0\\xa0 so there you have my five reasons to consider\\xa0\\ncoming here and hanging out in Poland in 2023\\xa0\\xa0 now with the Russo-Ukrainian War still ongoing\\xa0\\nI am not currently bringing clients to Ukraine,\\xa0\\xa0 Russia or Belarus so in lieu of that I've\\xa0\\nactually been here did a little bit of a\\xa0\\xa0 teaser for the tsar experience with a client\\xa0\\nwho's going to join me in Riga in Latvia\\xa0\\xa0 very soon just before that I'm actually going to\\xa0\\ngo back to Chișinău in Moldova with a client\\xa0\\xa0 and probably after using going back to Almaty\\xa0\\nthe Big Apple of Kazakhstan so it could be you\\xa0\\xa0 living it up on the tsar experience with me what\\xa0\\nare you doing next weekend?

       " \"what's up everyone welcome back to the channel and welcome back to another video have you ever wanted to visit krakow well today you're in luck because i'm going to be explaining my three-day itinerary of krakow for two people which you can use to adapt to create your own itinerary when you decide to buy that plane ticket and you should buy that plane ticket so we technically spent three nights and four days in krakow but the last day was more like a travel home day so that's why i've condensed this itinerary into three days and i'm also going to be telling up the cost of the entire trip to give you a rough idea of how much you need to budget for three days in this beautiful city this cost will be the cost for two people but just half it and you have your cost for one so i might be in the tropics tanning myself and sipping on exotic juices but let me take you back to the beginning of november on a cold winter's morning in london [Music] the air was chilly and our breath called up in front of our faces we had an early wake-up call at 3am making sure we had enough time for the 1.5 hour journey to the airport i'd fully recommend getting the earliest flight you can so that your first day there is a full day the trip there was painless we played 33 pounds for the airport car park and took a 10-minute shuttle bus to the airport terminal we headed straight for security and walked through without any issue i would always recommend an online check-in to avoid queues at the desk we stopped at a cafe rob could grab a coffee and do her makeup before heading to the gate to board the only re-entry requirements for uk citizens to enter poland at the time were to be fully vaccinated and to fill out a passenger locator form which was super easy the sunrise on the way though absolutely priceless the flight was just a short two hours before touching down in krakow and it was 35 pounds each return the bus took us to the terminal and getting through passport control was breezy we just had to show our vaccine qr codes the first bit of top quality travel advice i'll give is to get the bus to the old town and not a taxi a taxi driver came to us and offered us a taxi to the center for 10 euros but the bus ticket is only one pound seven for 60 minute ticket oh by the way i'm converting this on google at the time of recording which is around one gelato is 18p or about one pound is 5.61 so we rode the bus to the outskirts of krakow old town and picked a stop which would be an easy walk to the center the old town border is basically one big park which i thought was a nice touch also to note the public transport is pretty easy here if you use google maps to plan your trips trams run around the outside of the old town and further out into the city and are simple to use you just need to buy a ticket and stamp it in a machine when you get on after walking to the old town we spent some time exploring and enjoying the sites before we went on the hunt for a snack we found a nice little place called soroka cap that had some heating on we both got a juice and i got myself a tasty polish bagel roll couldn't eat anything on the menu so afterwards she went to starbucks to get herself a vegan drama with some food in our bellies we went out to explore more and found an old ornate church that was absolutely beautiful called the saint peter and paul church entry is free and you can even dive into the catacombs underneath where there are a bunch of tombs and informational signs walking further out took a survival royal castle and cathedral complex which you can purchase tickets online to go inside but we couldn't as they were sold out that day if you do decide to go here there are a lot of museums and buildings to explore head down the hill on the other side and you'll reach the riverfront this area is lovely for a walk or to relax and you will also find schmuck vervelskiy a statue of a dragon with many heads we took a long walk along the river and discovered that there are multiple maps across the city which are handy for tourists also you can hire golf buggy tours which should take you around the old town as well but we didn't do this it was then time to walk to our apartment for check-in we stayed in a flower residence apartment building and had a studio apartment to ourselves which was perfect for that short city break this accommodation cost us only 120 pounds for free nights rob had been wanting to go axe throwing on the lead up to this trip so she booked it for this evening for about 180 zlotar or 33 pound for an hour and a half that axe rang was less than a 10-minute walk from our apartment and the place that i can fully recommend the guy working there was an absolute hero spoke incredible english and was a top teacher he explained the technique like a pro would correct our errors and would be on standby whenever we needed him it was also bring your own bottle we both had an awesome time hitting and missing we played two games one where the goal was to reach certain amount of points first like darts and the other involved more precision where you had to hit certain areas of the target in a particular order safe to say i won every game at the end the guy taught us a few trick shots and made us look badass when we managed to hit the target with them and thus concluded our axe run experience we left badax throwing and went in search for our first night's dinner rob found a place called farmer on happy cow and i got myself a sub robin got a burger and we shared poutine and a couple of drinks for only 88 zlotar on the way back to our apartment we stopped at the store to grab a few things for the flat like cereal milk and juice as well as some quick snacks and then we went home for an early night to get ready for the solemn experience we were about to have the next day now if you've taken time to visit krakow before then you've probably found yourself visiting auschwitz which is where we decided to go on our second day the entire experience was very moving and the day was heavy but i definitely recommend it to everyone i honestly think it's somewhere everyone needs to go at least once it pays to remember history but honestly i'm not going to delve too much into the history on this video i just want to explain the process of how you can get to auschwitz and my experience of walking around the camp itself also be mindful there are areas that you aren't allowed to film or take photos so just watch out for these signs and be respectful of them and make sure you don't get your camera out in these areas i actually ended up filming this day on my phone because i didn't want to be walking around with a bulky camera and it was a lot easier and what i feel to be a lot more respectful just to have my phone out instead after a serial breakfast at the apartment we took a walk to the station located not far north east of krakow old town the bus we caught left the station at 11am sharp and it costed seven pounds each for a return ticket for a discover cracker you need to make sure that the tickets are printed as the driver does not accept a digital copy the journey itself took roughly an hour and a half and took us through a lot of the polish countryside which was interesting to see particularly the polish cemeteries which are full of flowers on every gravestone this is stark contrast to the uk where only newer burials would look this clean we arrived a bit early for our ticket entry so we explored the outside of the museum which had some information boards of stories and testimonies of a multitude of different families that had been victims of auschwitz each story was chilling to read now you may not know this but it is actually possible to get free tickets into auschwitz through their website austria.org these tickets are self-guided only which means you can go around at your own pace and you make your own way around the camp without a guide in contrast most people do get guided tours which are around 15 pound per person and they include travel to and from the museum you go in a group with a ton of other people and there will be a guy that takes you around the museum and will explain to you any information and answer any questions through a headset as they show you around the guided tours are not too expensive but we just felt like a self-guided tour and going at our own pace was more suited to the way that we wanted to visit however you do need to make sure you get a ticket either the free or the guided tour to guarantee your entry the ticket says to arrive 15 minutes early so at 1 pm we joined the queue to the museum entrance it was pretty long and unorganized but we finally got through the door through security and entered the camp there were signs posted all around the grounds that shared information of what life was like as a victim here most of the buildings have been converted into exhibitions and we decided to move at our own pace through them all the pictures and information they share invoke heavy feelings and thoughts about what tragedies occurred within these fences of auschwitz for me what hit home the most was the piles of discarded clothes and personal items that were confiscated from the victims on arrival it put into perspective the magnitude and the amount of people that once passed through auschwitz also walking through the gas chamber seeing the killing wall the emptiness of the camp and the multitude of warning signs around really adds the haunting feeling as you remember the history and the prisoners that were held here and that's all i'm going to say about the experience of walking around auschwitz you need to visit yourself and have your own experience as i think you should to grasp the magnitude and depth of the entire situation i'm going to continue this itinerary from after the tour of the museum i would recommend two to three hours here but it is also possible to do quicker and slower depending on how you want to experience the museum we left around quarter past three so we took around two and a half hours inside although our bus wasn't until ten past five we tried to catch a ten plus four bus but it only ran from friday to sunday so i definitely recommend researching the timetable before you book your bus tickets we took the dart right back to krakow and took a quick explore through the shopping center next to the bus station before walking to dinner rob found another vegan restaurant called no bones where we got some delicious dinner inside a funky looking restaurant we had udon fritters soup and a couple of beers before heading home to chill for an hour that evening we went to a bar rob discovered called cosmic bar which was three pounds each for entry and a ton of fun we got a couple of drinks each and spent hours playing the games and frolicking in the adult ball pit i would definitely recommend this place for a fun couple of hours out [Music] our third and final day in krakow was more like let's just do what we haven't done today day it was actually our busiest day in terms of activities and we were going pretty much non-stop the day started by heading to the old square with some bredwood pool and feeding the pigeons as far as i'm aware this is quite a popular thing to do as throughout the trip there are a ton of people and families feeling the birds i let rob had most of the fun while i filmed after the pigeons we took a walk down the market in the center of the square that was just opening the stores here were selling all sorts of merchandise and souvenirs and rob brought herself a magnet as she always does it for every place she goes to and we left next on my hit list was this place don't judge me i have this thing where i try mcdonald's in every country and then compare them all sue me after my cheeseburger i walked down the road and met robert starbucks we walked northwest to the museum of photographic history but unfortunately you couldn't just turn up and go in you had to book a time slot so we didn't manage to go in it is free though after this we paid for and hopped on the tram and took the 20 minute or so journey to the jewish quarter on the other side of the city when we arrived we went to the jewish square which we explored a bit and then went into the old synagogue that had been converted into a bookshop it was interesting here and displayed books and cds from all different languages we came across an israeli hummus bar and stopped here for lunch i had a homemade hummus and pita plate which was gorgeous and rob got herself a raspberry lemonade we demolished lunch like ravenous wolves explored the square some more and then bimbled over the bridge to the jewish ghetto a place where the nazis used to exploit the local jewish polls during the second world war again i'm not going to delve into too much of the history in this itinerary after a quick visit to a segment of the jewish ghetto wall which was still standing we headed to the nearby schindler's factory in a couple of days leading up to this we did try to get tickets to schindler's factory but we couldn't find tickets anywhere i think it's only open on certain days so you need to research this before you go there are a bunch of people all outside taking photos and reading the information boards but no one seems to be going in the museum we caught a tram back to where the bus station was and i grabbed the traditional polish donut and we stumbled across a cat caf that rob forced me inside it was nice enough here there was no entry freeze but we did buy a drink although the catchers did what cats do and kept themselves themselves and as per the rules we weren't allowed to bother them unless they came to us which they never did rock some lunch at a vega burger place called kravaskova treating herself to a wrap and some nachos and then we paid to climb the clock tower it was a very tight squeeze climbing up the stairs with people coming back down but on the way up our floors were small exhibitions that depicted the history of the old town square when we reached the top you got panoramic views of krakow which was stunning to see and the clock tower bell mechanism sat in the middle of the room i recommend coming up here just to see all the vistas of cracker the climb back down was steep but once out we went to an entertainment place to walk past on the first day it had a mirror maze vr roller coaster and a room full of lights it was a bit of a gimmick but actually we had a lot of fun here for five pounds each and i would recommend it we managed to squeeze in one last touristy thing on this day and visited rene underground museum we actually discovered that you could get the underground museum and the clock tower in a combo ticket if you just went to the ticket office outside the old square market it made it a little bit cheaper but unfortunately we missed out on this because we've done the clock tower earlier rinic underground museum is an interactive and educational place that lies under the old square it surprised me to learn that the square was actually excavated in 2009 and the relics and foundations found underneath were converted into this museum in 2010 it's 100 worth of visit on the way to dinner we stopped at a vegan bakery and got some snacks for our journey home the next day and then we went to a place to try some traditional pierogi which were absolutely delicious at a place called pierogi totu i would recommend coming here to try them and they do vegan ones as well on the last evening we tried to find a rooftop bar and failed we found a lesser known one in the krakow music academy building but it shut 30 minutes before we got there so we found a nice craft bar in the jewish quarter for a quick beer and stopped in a funky pub called the dog in the fog before heading home and calling us a night day four consisted of us getting two buses back to the airport and flying home at around 11am and that concludes our three-day identity krakow there are other things to do here such as schindler's factory the salt mines and a multitude of other museums but i feel like we managed to see most of krakow in just three days and this itinerary is a good basis for you to start building yours off if you're planning a long weekend here we tried to cover some popular locations as well as some lesser known locations as well tallying up the cost of this trip we spent 428 pound or 2310 zlotar for three action-packed days in cracker so around 214 pounds each for this trip now by no means did we do this cheaply and we also didn't splurge too much but it's obviously possible to spend much more or say if you're drinking or going to more expensive restaurants and you can still do it a lot cheaper as well if you go to the convenience stores or the supermarkets and buy food there take it home and make your own meals throughout the day but i think we found a nice middle ground between expensive and cheap so i really hope you found this video useful for your upcoming trip and i've added some value because that's

       " 'although Poland hosts one of the tiniest Muslim\\xa0\\nminorities in the whole world you have Muslim\\xa0\\xa0 families who have been settled in Poland since\\xa0\\nthe 14th century, so it is, at the same time, one\\xa0\\xa0 of the oldest Muslim minorities in Europe. hello\\xa0\\nand welcome my name is William and today I wanted\\xa0\\xa0 to share with you about Muslims in my parents\\xa0\\ncountry, Poland. when I embraced Islam in 2008 my\\xa0\\xa0 parents would still go to Poland visit family.\\xa0\\nI needed to figure out where I\\'m gonna pray,\\xa0\\xa0 where I\\'m gonna find a mosque or halal meat\\xa0\\nthen I stumbled upon the Wikipedia page and\\xa0\\xa0 I thought to myself: \"I didn\\'t know that\" and I want\\xa0\\nto tell the word about this. I decided back then to\\xa0\\xa0 produce my very first documentary which you can\\xa0\\nfind for free on YouTube called polish Muslims\\xa0\\xa0 and unexpected meeting. back then, the main\\xa0\\nright-wing narrative was that Muslims are not\\xa0\\xa0 welcome in Europe because they were never part of\\xa0\\nit. they do not belong to Europe. the fact that you\\xa0\\xa0 have Muslims settled in Poland since the 14th\\xa0\\ncentury was a magnificent counter-argument. when\\xa0\\xa0 I went to meet Muslims in Poland, I went to three\\xa0\\ndifferent areas. I went of course to the capital\\xa0\\xa0 city Warszawa, then I went to Katowice which is\\xa0\\nin Slask, in Silesia, which was a very\\xa0\\xa0 industrial region of Poland and the birthplace\\xa0\\nof my dad, eventually I went to Bialystok in\\xa0\\xa0 the northeastern part of the country. Muslims\\xa0\\nin Poland are made of three main\\xa0\\xa0 demographics. first the largest population is made\\xa0\\nof all different kinds of people who arrived in\\xa0\\xa0 Poland in the 20th century: people from North\\xa0\\nAfrica the Middle East and later on West Africa,\\xa0\\xa0 Turkey, South Asia and also lots of Muslims\\xa0\\ncoming from the Kawkas: Dagestan, Chechnya and so\\xa0\\xa0 on. and thanks to them, Poland has become the first\\xa0\\nand largest exporter of halal meat across Europe.\\xa0\\xa0 second are the numerous Poles who embraced Islam\\xa0\\nat some point in their lives. Third are the Tatars\\xa0\\xa0 this is the oldest Muslim Community in Poland.\\nTatars are tukric people who originated from Crimea\\xa0\\xa0 and came to Poland in the 14th century to offer\\xa0\\ntheir military services to the Duke of Poland\\xa0\\xa0 Lithuania at the time. To thank them for their\\xa0\\nservices, the Duke of Poland Lithuania, Prince\\xa0\\xa0 Witold, offered the Tatars land and the right to\\xa0\\npractice their religion. since then, you will find\\xa0\\xa0 in the northeastern part of Poland so around\\xa0\\nthe city of Bialystok mosques and Cemeteries\\xa0\\xa0 which are 300 400 years old and have very distinct\\xa0\\nlook. the highlight of my trip was meeting with the\\xa0\\xa0 tatars obviously because the first thing is when\\xa0\\nyou look at the mosques, the way they are built, is\\xa0\\xa0 very similar to the way people used to build \\xa0\\nchurches. the rituals might differ a little bit\\xa0\\xa0 from what people are used to see in Western Europe,\\xa0\\nfor example is the concept of sadoga. I went to\\xa0\\xa0 Poland for Ramadan and I spent Eid in in Poland\\xa0\\nand at that time after the Eid khutba (sermon) people would\\xa0\\xa0 leave sweets on the minbar on the mosque, and this\\xa0\\nis called sadoga which comes from the word sadaqa\\xa0\\xa0 you may have guessed. Because of Communism many\\xa0\\nTatars had to hide their religiosity to the point\\xa0\\xa0 where people even adopted Christian sounding names\\xa0\\nto hide for example Ali would become Alexander and\\xa0\\xa0 like many Muslims you would find in Central Asia\\xa0\\npart of the ex-communist block countries, for many\\xa0\\xa0 people Islam has now become nothing more than a\\xa0\\ncultural heritage so you will see people who are\\xa0\\xa0 proud to be Muslim but people who are also happy\\xa0\\nto drink some vodka. and there was a point because\\xa0\\xa0 of Communism where these historic mosques would\\xa0\\nopen only 14 times a year twice for Eid and 12\\xa0\\xa0 times because there was one Juma per month.\\xa0\\nand thanks to the influx of migrants from the\\xa0\\xa0 Middle East and other parts of the world now the\\xa0\\nyounger Generations are starting to reconnect with\\xa0\\xa0 their faith and tradition so you would see younger\\xa0\\ntatars who wear the hijab for example, while it was\\xa0\\xa0 not the case for their parents generation. when\\xa0\\nit comes to other groups of Muslims and because\\xa0\\xa0 there is very few mosques in Poland what was\\xa0\\nheartwarming is unlike some Western European\\xa0\\xa0 countries, in the mosque you would find a huge\\xa0\\ndiversity of people people from very different\\xa0\\xa0 cultures, ethnicities, social economic backgrounds.\\xa0\\npeople speaking all sorts of languages and the\\xa0\\xa0 khutba would be in Polish. sadly you will have\\xa0\\nsome political divisions when it comes to the\\xa0\\xa0 representation of Muslims in Poland specifically\\xa0\\nbetween the Muslim League which is made of people\\xa0\\xa0 who mainly arrived in Poland in the 20th century\\xa0\\nso the majority and group of Muslims and between\\xa0\\xa0 the Tatars who claim a right for representation\\xa0\\nbecause they are the oldest demographic of Muslims\\xa0\\xa0 in Poland. also the Tatars are an officially\\xa0\\nrecognized minority by the government and every\\xa0\\xa0 year there is a commemoration of their military\\xa0\\nservices to the country. and since I\\'ve made my\\xa0\\xa0 documentary in 2012, 2013 things have changed\\xa0\\nin Poland and and the far right has taken over\\xa0\\xa0 with a very strong anti-muslim narrative and\\xa0\\nshortly after I left I read the news and so\\xa0\\xa0 the mosques being burned people being attacked\\xa0\\non the streets so life has become slightly more\\xa0\\xa0 difficult for Muslims in Poland. one striking\\xa0\\nexample of how people try to go low profile\\xa0\\xa0 now is this kiosk this small Kebab shop in the\\xa0\\ncenter of Warszawa which was called \"salaam alaikum\\xa0\\xa0 kebab\" and I thought back in the days, that was\\xa0\\nreally really a bold idea to call your Kebab\\xa0\\xa0 shop like this in the middle of Warszawa and then so\\xa0\\nI\\'ve returned to Warszawa last year and in the in\\xa0\\xa0 the center of the city and now salaam alaikum\\xa0\\nKebab has become hello Kebab. if you want to\\xa0\\xa0 know more about Muslims in Poland I invite you\\xa0\\nto have a look at this documentary I produced\\xa0\\xa0  now 10 years ago which is freely available on\\xa0\\nYouTube polish Muslims documentary just type in on\\xa0\\xa0 YouTube it will appear in the meantime thank\\xa0\\nyou for watching and take care of each other',\n",

and the sudden death of his son Tsar tank and grandson Alexei his brother burka became town burka was a convert to Islam at this time still uncommon within the Jochen territories certainly his religion played a role in the souring of relations between burka and his cousin Hulagu when the latter destroyed baghdad in 1258 but conflicts did not break out until 1262 filagot seizure of the

Shivan Hulagu sent first his Vanguard under Sherman no Yan before setting out with his main army in August while another ill canid force under some eager and Abbott I approached no guy destroyed Sherman's army in mid-october but was forced to flee after an encounter with Sam eager and Abbot I when Hulagu learned of no guys flight he marched to Shema key where he forced berker to withdraw by December Burke and no guy retreated past Derbent leaving a contingent to man that mighty fortress though it fell quickly to the ilkhanate forces on the 7th of December and they continued to pursue Burke and Nauheim on the 15th no guy suffered a major defeat at the hands of Sherman Noah Abbott I and Hulagu son Ibaka seeing no guy withdraw to the steppe Abbott I and Sherman urged tobacco to return to his father but the Prince declined with reinforcements sent by Hulagu he followed the Joads trail finding burkas abandoned camp on the north bank of the frozen Terek River tents herds

Ibaka's men unprepared the ilkhanate forces flew across the frozen river but under their weight the ice broke beneath them Ibaka escaped back to his father and burka retook derbent Kublai Khan was unable to prevent the continued conflict between the now independent Golden Horde and the L Carnot Hulagu died in 1265 and was succeeded by Ibaka an opportunity for burka to secure the caucuses no guys set out with a large army from Derbent in early summer 1265 in late July or August no guy was met by a force under Rebecca's brother Joe Schmidt on the axle River in modern Azerbaijan an arrow took no guy's eye and his army was defeated with heavy losses withdrawing to Shivan meanwhile both ibaka Khan and burka Khan arrived with reinforcements forming up on banks across the curry river shooting arrows at each other but unable to forge the river for 14 days they waited until burka moves towards the Georgian capital of tiflis but fell ill and died enroute leading to a general

as the bailer bay and largely left no guy to his own affairs returning to Eastern Europe we will briefly mention development since the 1240s the Mongol withdrawal gave Bella the fourth breathing room and he started building up the defences of his kingdom encouraging the nobility to build stone castles west of the Danube and on the kingdom's northeastern borders the now depopulated Hungarian plain he gave to the commands his allies through a marriage alliance between his son Stefan and their Khan's daughter marriage ties were also established with a number of his neighbors but his requests for aid from the Pope fell on deaf ears and he fought with king ottokar the second of Bohemia the inheritor of the Austrian babban Berg territory in 1253 the westernmost worst principalities Galicia and valina declared their independence from the Mongols under Prince Daniel romanovitch Daniel was crowned king of Ruthenia by people on voice but that crown was all the aid he'd received from the West and it brought the Mongols attention initial efforts by the general khemsa to assert authority over Daniel were unsuccessful until burkha replaced khemsa with the commander baron de a veteran who had distinguished himself during the invasion of Patton in 1259 burundi entered galicia daniil fleeing to poland and then Hungary in Daniel's absence his brother Basilico and son Lev submitted to Baron die who ordered the destruction of the fortifications of kaliesha and for Linea also in 1259 burkas own voice reached Bella the fourth demanding his military assistance and a marriage Alliance Bella used the threat to try to leverage the Pope into providing him aid which the papacy declined which forced the King to nominally submit to the Mongols appeasing them with tribute it would certainly explain why when Aaron died asserted the hordes suzerainty over kaliesha bulimia he left Hungary unscathed while he marched into Poland in November 12 59 it is unknown how many men were ruined I brought with him but his Mongol and Turkic horsemen were reinforced by a sizeable Galician Valene e'en contingent under vasilica romanovitch ver and i bypassed Lublin and savvy coast crossing the vistula river and began ravaging Polish territory his army came to San Damir surrounding and enclosing it with a stockade trapping the citizens within missiles were held at the defenses for three days

fell to their deaths into the moat though seeking shelter in the town's church were trapped as fire spread and whoever survives the conflagration was driven out onto the plain before the city and slaughtered by April 1260 the rend eyes army withdrew prisoners and loot in tow a Mongol attack is recorded on Lithuania and Prussia in the same year inflicting heavy losses on the Teutonic Knights

across the Northeast and raiding as far as the environs of Buda and pest the Mongols did not come prepared for sieges and bypassed heavily fortified points no guy likely intended to use the maneuverability of his forces to stay ahead of the Hungarian main army moving quickly and apparently dividing his men into small regiments to raid but since the 1240s Hungary had seen a growth in the number of parodies rather than a main army raised against them the mongols were confronted by local defensive forces wherever they moved by breaking his forces off as he had he allowed them to be overwhelmed in local engagements one defender with particular success was a master Jorge founder of the Chernobyl house in Shiraz County who with his own locally raised forces overcame Mongol troops several times and sent their severed heads to king ladislaus though the mongols were faced by stiff resistance they were able to capture their share of prisoners and loot the sources indicate famine hunger and sickness among the Mongols no guy until Ibuka must have decided to cut their losses and withdraw moving east in two main forces by the end of march 1285 no guy's army moved through

RUSSIA LAUNCHING A MAJOR MISSILE ATTACK IN CITIES ACROSS UKRAINE  AND A REPORT A MISSILE CROSSED  INTO NATO TERRITORY KILLING TWO  PEOPLE IN POLAND. GREG PALKOT IS LIVE IN KYIV. WHAT DO WE KNOW AND WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS? >> JOHN, THIS IS THE HUGE  SIGNIFICANT EVENT THAT WE ARE  JUST TRACKING JUST THE LAST  COUPLE OF MINUTES. ACCORDING TO A SENIOR U.S.  OFFICIAL AND ACCORDING TO  REPORTS ON THE GROUND, A RUSSIAN MISSILE FIRED FROM SOMEWHERE OFF OF UKRAINE WENT INTO UKRAINE AIR SPACE BUT THEN VEERED INTO  EASTERN POLAND AND ACTUALLY HIT  A TARGET, NOT A TARGET, BUT A  SITE IN EASTERN POLAND KILLING  TWO PEOPLE. FIRST TIME SOMETHING LIKE THIS  HAS HAPPENED. THIS TRIGGERS ALL SORTS OF  QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE  REACTION COULD BE FROM NATO. I THINK WE ALL KNOW NOW ABOUT  THAT ARTICLE 5 OF NATO THAT ANY  ATTACK ON AN ALLY OF THE UNITED  STATES OF A NATO MEMBER WOULD  TRIGGER SOME KIND OF RESPONSE  FROM NATO. SO BREAKING NEWS IN THE LAST TEN MINUTES OR SO. WE ARE TRACKING IT, WE'LL GIVE  YOU MORE AS WE KNOW ABOUT IT. BUT YES, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE  HUGE BARRAGE OF MISSILES THAT  HIT UKRAINE TODAY. THE BIGGEST BARRAGE OF THIS  ENTIRE WAR. WE HEARD A FEW HOURS AGO THE AIR RAID SIRENS. WE HEARD EXPLOSIONS. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE SAW. >> WHAT HAPPENED IS A RUSSIAN  MISSILE WAS FLYING OVER THIS  RESIDENTIAL AREA, IT WAS SHOT BY UKRAINIAN AIR DEFENSES, SOME  FRAGMENTS HIT THAT BUILDING,  CAUSED A HOLE, A LOT OF DAMAGE  AND THEN PIECES OF THAT MISSILE  FELL DOWN INTO THE STREET. YOU CAN SEE IT RIGHT HERE BEING  TAKEN AWAY BY OFFICIALS. >> INCREDIBLE STUFF. THE FIRE RAGED FROM THE BUILDING FOR A LONG TIME. ONE PERSON WAS KILLED, ONE  INJURED. WE WERE AT THE SCENE. WE CAN'T BELIEVE THE CASUALTY  TOLL WAS NOT HIGHER. OVER 90 MISSILES WERE FIRED BY  RUSSIA IN THE DIRECTION OF  UKRAINE FROM ALL SIDES. UKRAINE SAYS IT SHOT DOWN AROUND 70, BUT THE REST GOT THROUGH. ONCE AGAIN, THOSE HITTING POWER  STATIONS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE  ELECTRIC GRID HERE, AND KNOCKED  OUT POWER ALL OVER, MILLIONS  TONIGHT IN KYIV AND THE COUNTRY  ARE WITHOUT ELECTRICITY. PRESIDENT'S OFFICE SAID IT WAS  RUSSIA'S RESPONSE TO ZELENSKYY'S MESSAGE TO THE G20 SUMMIT SAYING RUSSIA NEEDS TO WITHDRAW, AND  OTHERS THINK IT WAS FROM THE  TAKING OF KHERSON. BUT THE BREAKING NEWS FOLLOWING  HERE, JOHN AND SANDRA,  POTENTIALLY IMMENSELY  SIGNIFICANT. LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THOSE  MISSILES, ACCORDING TO A U.S.  OFFICIAL, ASSOCIATED PRESIDENT  IS REPORTING, WE DO NOT HAVE IT  YET CONFIRMED FROM POLISH  AUTHORITIES, IT SEEMS LIKE ONE  OF THOSE RUSSIAN MISSILES  STRAYED ACROSS THE BORDER  BETWEEN UKRAINE AND POLAND, HIT  A SITE IN POLAND, APPARENTLY A  CIVILIAN SITE THERE, BUT KILLING TWO PEOPLE. WE UNDERSTAND THE POLISH  GOVERNMENT IS IN EMERGENCY  SESSION NOW TAKING A LOOK AT  THIS. WE'LL BE WATCHING IT AS THE DAY  DEVELOPS. BACK TO YOU GUYS. >> John: THINKING ABOUT THE  POTENTIAL REPERCUSSIONS, POLAND  IS A NATO MEMBER, NATO HAS  ARTICLE 5, ATTACK AGAINST ONE IS ATTACK AGAINST ALL, IS THIS  SOMETHING THAT COULD POTENTIALLY RISE TO ARTICLE 5 LEVEL OR DO  YOU THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL BE CONTAINED JUST IN THE  POLISH GOVERNMENT, A STRONG  RESPONSE TOWARD RUSSIA AND NOT  MUCH ELSE? >> WE CAN'T PREDICT THAT AT THIS POINT, BUT CERTAINLY THROUGHOUT  THIS ENTIRE WAR AND PRIOR TO  THIS WAR, PRIOR TO  FEBRUARY 24TH, THAT HAS BEEN THE RISK. THAT HAS BEEN THE DANGER THAT  THE U.S. AND NATO ALLIES HAVE  BEEN VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. NATO HAS BEEN WORKED HARD TO  PREVENT THIS WAR FROM HAPPENING  ESSENTIALLY BECAUSE OF THIS KIND OF DANGER, AND IT HAS FLATLY  STATED BEFORE AND DURING, DURING THIS WAR, THAT IF RUSSIA DECIDED TO INTENTIONALLY ATTACK ANY NATO ALLY, THERE WOULD BE A NATO  RESPONSE AND FRANKLY, ACCORDING  TO THE NATO CHARTER, THAT COULD  BE VERY STRONG.

       " 'Ketchup - no What is this makaron? I do not need Ooh! Oh babushka! Welcome to Poland, kurwa mac Welcome everyone to professional slavic country review Through the eyes of Boris the shashlik king Okay let\\'s get right into it Poland is very nice country With a great many things to offer Including some of the best mayonez ever created So why did I go to Poland in first place? Because [truck] it, why not I just felt like driving Sit down. Start up blyatmobile Drive 1000km and OPA is Poland So what are things to see in Poland? Well, the beer price tags are very nice to look at And of course let\\'s not forget Top quality slav fashion sense Although taking pictures of Adidas shop You will get kicked out of shopping centre Until you get to next shopping centre And you try to explain \"no blyat I am slav superstar why you do this\" And then go for drink instead But no, before you even arrive in capital city of Poland You go through [trucking] hours of road works And big trucks There is a million of these trucks everywhere And my guess is, they are carrying good quality Polish mayonez To rest of world But no even before you arrive in Poland There is guard at border checkpoint coming to ask you About something And at this point I did realise You really need to speak Polish to go to Poland Because after asking him: English? He say: no! And after saying: po russkii? He clearly lost his interest to talk to me any longer And hinted me to kindly [duck] off So I did. And got a beer. It was good Once I finally arrived in capital city Warsaw I was instantly greeted with many places willing to sell me a lot of beer At very good price Most of these places being open 24h every day But this being slav country, I am not surprised Looking back at our Polish lesson What do we remember? Beer is piwo Yes correct You go to shop. You say: And not the usual: Or if you are in hurry, you can say: They will understand So when I went to Warsaw, I was expecting high-rise soviet style apartment buildings But what I got instead was these massive office buildings and hotels And high-rise buildings of course And blin was there so many trams here There was maybe 5-6 buses And a trillion trams blin More trams than cherries in babushka\\'s kompot Blin there is even bar named Tramwaj And what is up with all the kebab places? Does everyone like kebab so much? Blin seriously I am considering coming to Poland, starting my own business The palace of the shashlik king We serve blins, shashlik and kompot You show up in Adidas tracksuit You get 10% discount So what else is there? You can buy clothes with price of kilogram City is very nice and green There is bench for sleep if you have had too much водка And some rare black chickens here Some more high-rise apartment buildings right in town center Right next to fancy hotel that cost you arm and leg to stay in And maybe half of liver But at least there is flower shop for you to buy Because remember, slav girls, they love their flowers And the fancy cars, oh my god look at this [ship] blyat I should have gotten this for blyatmobile Look at that quality! And another pretty common thing to see is this And I do not mean street market selling components for kompot But they actually sell whole sunflowers here Now that is next level of slav If you are walking on street and you happen to not be in shopping center You will see that every shop is as small as neighbor Vadim\\'s apartment And there is a hundred shops on each big road Where you can buy everything to fulfill your slav needs Including but not limited to Even more alcohol Looking at traffic in midtown Warsaw You might consider it is very calm and normal But you actually have to drive like race driver to keep pace with everyone else My suggestion: you come try it out yourself The metro tunnels in town look something directly taken from the brain Of the author of Metro 2033 But sadly inside I did not find any trace of mutants or Artyom And since the air was breathable outside, I just went for drink instead If you want to travel to Poland, you will need to know they have their own currency The Polish Zloty After I exchanged some currency and went to Poland And checked out the prices I realised something I [trucking] love Poland And then went for drink There are many smaller cities in Poland you can check out Like this Lomza, for example Very nice people. Actually there is very nice people all around Poland Especially if you know how to speak Polish You say: Is all okay People are very happy to help you find good squat location And also take picture Also remember, if you want to fit in to local crowd Just put on your tracksuit Look at this guy. Adidas pants and Nike shoes I bet you five blins he watches my channel So go ahead and watch it as well Put on your tracksuit And let\\'s turn this cheeki sad into a cheeki breeki! If you like walking streets of Warsaw You will see many nice things to take pictures of Like this beautiful wall of art for example Being accompanied by its official guardian - the squatting gopnik Okay so other times you will just see some crazy [ship] Most of the time, [ship] that you do not want explanation to Or maybe other times you might come across one of these cars That has seen some rough slav love Both outside and in Okay maybe I should not be complaining. Maybe this is someone\\'s regular car If you plan to go on exploring some of the back streets of Warsaw Keep in mind that you are usually not alone And you could find some new friends of cheeki breeki hardbass And then go for drink You know, generally for most people there is no reason to go to Poland ever But already I can say 3 reasons One - good mayonez Two - the beer is cheap. And good And three - they have shop named Kakadu, blin It\\'s like... It\\'s like they knew I was coming I am honored, Poland. You make me happy At this time the security came to stop me filming again So I filmed the electric stairs instead Mmm... This is some slav magic Some more reasons I like Poland so much Especially since I was driving There is a million signs on highway saying: Konec As if to say: the end is near. Don\\'t worry. You\\'ll be hitting a deer And also driving along highway I see these signs Danger - piesi So I try remember Aha! Dog - pies So all the time I am driving. I am thinking Do they have problem with wild dogs here or what? But after driving home very carefully looking for dogs It turns out, piesi does not mean dogs after all It mean pedestrians So that\\'s why I almost ran people over Blin! And my last favorite sign No not that I mean sign of cows on road Giving milk to fuel the Polish economy Well of course that doesn\\'t say that on sign, but It is strongly implied If you do plan to go exploring in city center of Warsaw I strongly suggest you do it at day It\\'s not that people are going mug you or steal your money It\\'s just that in daytime you are more likely to hear someone scream \"kurwa mac\" And that will make the trip worth it If it is someone missing their tram Or maybe someone falling off their rental bike There is always reason to say \"kurwa\" Like for example: Which means it\\'s [trucking] raining In city center there is large clock tower It show the time Oh look it\\'s beer o\\' clock Some very helpful people here to teach you some mathematics Like blin + blin = blyat If you are into some modern Polish art then I suggest you check out \"The shopping cart of fortune\" Some say the bum who rolled this here, is now Polish Olympic athlete Others say this cart has been here from beginning of time I say it is beautiful blyat. It is blyatiful But if you really want to see something truly beautiful Just open your eyes, man And get out of way. Because locals drive twice as fast as speed limit So there is a thousand places in Poland you can visit If I could, I would squat on every street corner of every town of every city And visit every Adidas shop Just to say: Never fear, Boris is here But remember if you do happen to go outside in the night Try out the local pubs and food places. You will like it Warsaw at night is beautiful And never fear to go on the Polonez taxi It will take you in new slav directions you have never seen before But probably to shop to get some more piwo and vodka And after you drive the long way back to your home Remember the polish kielbasa you bought Dip it inside the sweet heavenly slav elixir That is Polish mayonez Don\\'t forget to lock your door Unless you want other people to get wrong idea I mean Polish sausage not for sharing blyat You think I drive to Poland for fun? No no no Friends suggest me I try this mayonez Winiary And now when I run out - I need to go back to Poland, blyat That is the way of the slav and the Boris You want it - you go get it And that is exactly how I will be doing next slav country review If you like this video, write in comments What country I should visit next But until then, my friends I will be enjoying my kielbasa and mayonez from Poland Stay cheeki breeki, my friends! I will see you next time',\n",
       " \"(upbeat music) - Welcome to my Poland travel video where I'll be your Polish travel guide. Want to visit Poland or know\\nwhat things to do in Poland? This video covers two\\nweeks worth of adventures in Poland during the month of September. Join us on our two week adventure as we go all around the country. The first stop on our\\nPoland tour was Krakow, a city in southern Poland. On day one, we visited the market square. Made an effort to try\\ndifferent types of foods, we went shopping, and most importantly we tried to adjust to the six hour time difference. As for accommodations, this was the first time\\nwe only booked Airbnbs. So the funny thing about our Airbnb that we did not realize\\nis common in Europe are the way the doors\\nand the windows open. So what we did is we opened the handle to the top and we were\\ntryin' to open the door and the top half literally came off. We thought it came off the hinges. We contacted our Airbnb host and we were just like oh my God, so we broke your door. She was panicking a bit too but soon after we realized that when you put it back down, put the handle the regular way and just pull, ta-da! Now that we've been able to\\nhave a good night's rest, let's see what day two in\\nKrakow has in store for us. So we just got to check\\nout the Wawel Cathedral as well as the Bell Tower where you can have an excellent viewpoint and a museum. What we did is an audio tour guide which you get one of these head sets. I know, super glamorous\\nand you follow along here. This was a little confusing at times but overall definitely\\nworth the experience. I loved the little detailing. I just wanna quickly mention\\nthat having a rental car to do this tour of Poland\\nwas extremely helpful. In Krakow, we discovered\\nthat there are many areas on the street where you\\ncan park your car for free on the weekends, bonus. So, we haven't had time\\nto rent one of these 'cause we've been using our feet to walk but if you do, just download an app. They're all over the city and when you're done, you\\njust leave it where it is. Don't be afraid to get lost in Poland. You never know where you're gonna end up. (upbeat music) Many people recommended to\\ncheck out the salt mines when in Poland so we decided\\nto do the miner's route instead of the tourist route so that means there are two. This one was more authentic as you can tell by the wardrobe. We've got like emergency\\nequipment on us, you get a map, it's around two hours. I was a little chilly. I'm wearing like a long sleeve underneath so I was a little cold and\\nit's a pretty neat experience. Wieliczka Salt Mine is one of Poland's oldest business ventures. It is a monument to the history of Poland and the Polish nation with\\nover 1,000,000 tourists visiting each year. Online ticket prices for the salt mine were approximately 89 złoty per person. There are many mounds in Poland. We decided to go to a paying one to guarantee a beautiful view. If you have about an hour in your day and you're in Krakow, check it out. Maybe they're all around the country but I know for sure that they're here. You also get access to a little museum which we're about to go to next. (upbeat music) Okay, we've spent a\\ngood few days in Krakow. Now, let's head to Zakopane. Between Canada and over here in Poland, I always seem to push\\nwhen I'm supposed to pull with the doors and vice versa so as you can tell you gotta pull. Zakopane is a town in the\\nextreme south of Poland. We primarily came here to hike and to see the Tatra Mountains. But of course we tried to\\nsqueeze in anything extra. We are in the center of Zakopane. There are a lot of options for things to eat from\\nstands to restaurants. You name it, come hungry\\nhere 'cause the food is prett yoogd from\\nwhat we've tried so far. Also, I noticed that a lot of\\nstores, like clothing stores, are not open on Sundays\\nso save your shopping for days during the week. And also, fun fact, a\\nlot of people come here from the Ukraine because\\nyou don't need a visa. Day two in Zakopane brought us to one of our trip highlights, Morskie Oko. If you are looking for a\\nvariety of hike options, this is the place to visit. Today we are at Morskie Oko. It cost us about 30 złoty\\nwhich is around $10 Canadian to park our car because we drove and then five złoty each per person to get into the park. So Morskie Oko is within the Tatra Mountains. It's absolutely beautiful here. It took us about two hours and 15 minutes from the very bottom to get up here. You do have the option to\\ntake a horse-drawn carriage. That is about 50 złoty per person. It's up to you. We walked it, it was fine. It's not too much of a heavy terrain but you do have to have a bit of endurance so make sure you get a good night's sleep. We are here around September so the temperatures are\\nconstantly changing and elevating so bring lots of layers, you'll be fine. Hiking shoes are always a good idea. So we decided to hike up from Morskie Oko about 45 minutes to (speaking in Polish). It's quite an uphill hike so if you don't have hiking shoes, make sure you bring some poles. The view here is pretty good but what I love most about anything is seeing Morskie Oko from like this bird's eye view. So to me, it's a 10 outta 10. As it is now time to leave Zakopane, I wanted to quickly step\\ninto an upside down house. What am I talking about? Here, I'll show you. So over here we're at a very\\nquick tourist attraction which is 13 złoty which\\nis around $5 Canadian. You can see an upside down house. When you go in there, you're only allowed to be there for five minutes\\nbecause you get dizzy. So if you have about\\nhalf an hour in your day and you're in Zakopane, check it. (upbeat music) Wroclaw is a place we\\nabsolutely fell in love with and it is the largest\\ncity in Western Poland. We are in the beautiful city of Wroclaw. Over here there is a large university so you will see a ton of students. It's a very picturesque city. If you're lucky, you'll\\nsee a lot of gnomes. The city is known for that. We're gonna head and visit some viewpoints to get some incredible views because we're only here for\\none day, passing through. So let's go see what we see. Not only is Wroclaw known for a number of historical sites, but I heard that some bars\\nand pubs stay open in Wroclaw until the last person leaves. We didn't stay out to test it that late so if you you'll have to let me know in the comment box below\\nif it's actually true. After climbing way too many\\nsteps, we made it to the top of the lookout tower\\nof the Garrison Church. You just peek through. To get some incredible views. Let's quickly head out now\\nand peek into the panorama of the Battle of Raclawice. The picture is 114 meters\\nlong and 15 meters high. I swear we're leaving Wroclaw soon but if you see the\\npanorama, grab one of these to select your language which is English and you'll be able to get the full history of this beautiful panoramic painting. And yes, I just had to run off as the employee was rushing us\\nout for the next group tour. Poznan was on our list of places to visit because my dad studied and\\nlived there in the '80s so naturally I was curious to see. We made it to Poznan which is a cute little\\ntown as you can see. We saw the billy goats\\nhit their heads at noon which happens every single day here at the (speaking in Polish)\\nwhich is the old town square. And now we're gonna try\\na St. Martin's croissant which is protected by the\\nEuropean Union certificate of authenticity which means it\\ncan only be reproduced here. I think it's raining so let's give this a shot. Interested in seeing more\\nabout food in Poland? Well, stay tuned for my next video that features all of\\nthe dishes that we ate, what food we tried, just\\nfor you to get an idea of what to order when you're in Poland. We made it Kolobrzeg! - Kolobrzeg.\\n- Kolobrzeg. - Kolobrzeg is a Polish city\\nlocated on the Baltic Sea in the northwestern part of Poland. So we're in Kolobrzeg\\nand I wanted to mention that especially in this area there are a lot of sanatoriums. So really what that means\\nis if you have an illness that you've been wanting\\nto cure for a while and you have a doctor's\\nnote, you can come here. They kinda have like spas. And a doctor will give you like a certain schedule to follow. You can also purchase more. I find that really interesting\\n'cause we don't seem to have that in Canada that I'm aware of. This is also a really beautiful place in the summer so that was my fun fact for the day 'cause that is something I didn't know before I came to Poland. Kolobrzeg has a 12 kilometer long beach and is a popular holiday spot. Manowo is a village in Poland, specifically near the city of Kozalin. Usually during our\\nvacation, we take hotels but this time we took an Airbnb, every single day we're\\nin a different location. But of course I have family here in Poland so we are lucky to stay in Manowo. Since I haven't been back\\nto Poland in 15 years, it was nice to see and compare how some of my family lives in Poland. When my mom was younger,\\nand still living in Poland, her family would often go to\\npick blueberries and mushrooms. They even ended up selling them. I've noticed that people still do this on the streets of Poland. This was my first time as well\\nas my boyfriend's first time picking mushrooms and boy was it an experience I'll never forget. So make some friends with some locals and maybe they'll take\\nyou out to some good spots to pick some mushrooms of your own. Are you enjoying this video? Well, guess what, I have\\ntons of other travel videos so don't forget to hit the\\nlike button, subscribe, leave me a comment, join me on\\nInstagram, Facebook, Twitter. You name it, I'm there. On our way to Gdansk, we stopped at a little town called Sopot, just to see this cute little coffee shop. Isn't it neat? Sopot is a town on the Baltic\\nSea in Northern Poland. Right now we are in Sopot. Right behind me is the\\nlongest wooden pier in Poland. Sopot is in the middle of two other cities because this little area\\nis called Trojmiasto which is like a tricity so right beside Gdansk and Gdynia. It's so busy here. We're here on a Sunday. So many people you guys\\ncan't even imagine. And what we have noticed that's trending are leather jackets so\\nif you've got a leather, faux leather, anything of that sort, pants, shorts, skirts, bring them. Gdansk is located on the Baltic Sea. We spent two days here but even if you can only\\nspend one day in Gdansk, you'll get a good glimpse of what Gdansk is all about. So right behind me here\\nyou see a bar mleczny, which literally means milk bar. They're a traditional style\\nbreakfast, lunch, dinner places that are on the cheaper side. Very cafeteria style. So budget friendly. We just tried it out for the first time. We loved it. If you don't see a menu\\nwith English subtitles kind of underneath, then\\nI would suggest googling what you really love so you\\nknow what words to look out for. Most places in Poland do\\nhave English translations and sometimes Spanish translations. This one didn't. But they have a lot of food on display so you cannot go wrong if you find these little bar mlecznys. Can you say Gdansk? I know, it's hard. I can only say it because I speak Polish. Let's try it together. Gdansk, Gdansk, good job. We are in beautiful Gdansk. It is electric, vibrant,\\ncolorful, musical. There's so many creative people here. Doing their thing. If you guys are paying\\nwith cash wherever you go within Poland what we've noticed is that they want exact\\nchange most of the time so if you're bringing like 100 złoty, like, big bills they\\ntend to struggle with it. I'm not sure why they don't\\nhave lots of change on hand but always have lots of coins and you should be fine. (upbeat music) Now let's head to the largest city and the capital of Poland, Warsawa. Or as most English speakers\\nlike to say, Warsaw. We made it to Warsaw. Right now we're in the Palace\\nof Culture and Science. It cost us about 20 złoty per person to get up to the top. Yes you take an elevator and\\nyou get an amazing viewpoint. You definitely feel the rush of the city here so lemme show you the viewpoint and then let's explore Warsaw\\nfor the next three days. Are you a city person or\\nmore of a nature person? Lemme know in the comment box below. If you answered city and you love to shop, just like me, I'm gonna show\\nyou which mall was my favorite. In the center of Warsaw you have, right next to the railway station, a shopping center called Złote Tarasy. We're going on Segways today. My first Segway experience. Oh I'm super nervous. I'm going in circles. My boyfriend seemed to pick\\nup the Segway skills faster but it was hard with all\\nthe cobblestone streets. It made the ride so bumpy. Plus I didn't wanna hit anyone. We are in beautiful Warsawa. Every country we visit, we try to get on their public transportation system and just compare it to what\\nwe have at home in Toronto. Even though we had a car,\\nwe wanted to check out the transit system here in Poland so right now we're taking the subway. We did take the bus before. And prices range from\\ntwo złoty to four złoty. It obviously depends where you go. It goes on zones. But everything's been\\nsmooth sailing so good luck. All right, now let's get outside in nature and visit a park that was\\nrecommended over and over again. We made it to Lazienki Park\\nwhich is the largest park in Warsaw or Warsawa, however\\nyou like to pronounce it. You can come here for a run, a jog, a stroll with your children. It's beautiful, there's a restaurant, there's a palace as you can see behind me so there's no shortages of\\nthings to do here in Warsawa. On our very last day it\\nwas raining on and off. We weren't sure what to do so we decided to take a peek at Warsawa's multipurpose sports\\nand entertainment stadium. We just did the PGE\\nNarodowy Stadium VIP tour. This stadium is a multipurpose stadium so there's concerts, sporting events, what we got in this\\nlittle excursion of ours is we got to see the locker rooms. There are even prison\\ncells here, lodge rooms, different viewpoints,\\nit's something to be seen. Tickets are around 27 złoty. So I'll convert that down below. And the tour is approximately\\nan hour to an hour and a half so you can go at your leisure. So if you're into sports, I would suggest coming here. Don't forget to like, subscribe, and share this video with your friends. Let's go to the next country.\",\n",

       " 'Have you ever heard that we drink a lot of tea in Poland? That an average Pole drinks at least a glass of tea a day? This may seem surprising, shocking to some of you. After all, Poland is not one of the countries where tea is considered a national drink. Nor is it one of the countries with a specific tea drinking culture. That is, we drink tea as we want, we don\\'t have a specific method of brewing tea or a specific time when we drink tea. And we\\'ll talk about how we drink it today. If you are here for the first time, my name is Ania, I am a teacher of Polish as a foreign language, and this is Płynnie po polsku, a channel and podcast for learners of Polish as a foreign language. Remember that you can find the podcast on various platforms such as Google Podcasts or Spotify, or you can listen to it on YouTube on my channel Płynnie po polsku. You will also find a transcript on my website, and on YouTube you will find subtitles in Polish and English. There is also some news on my channel. If you sign up for my Patreon, you will also be able to get the vocabulary list for this podcast in pdf and exercises for this podcast. I strongly encourage and highly recommend it. There are three subscription thresholds, they are named after Polish cars: the first is Maluch, the second is Syrena, the third is Polonez. There are very, very different possibilities to learn Polish by yourself thanks to this. You can find a link to this Patreon on my YouTube channel. Ok, we\\'re starting the podcast about tea. I don\\'t think I would be a real linguist if I hadn\\'t started this podcast with the word \"tea\". Because if you don\\'t know me yet, I\\'m a linguist by profession. And I was wondering where the word \"tea\" in Polish came from. As you can see, it is neither very similar to words from western countries, nor to words from eastern countries. I mean, it\\'s not the same as those other tea words from other languages. The etymology shows that \"herba\", that is the first part of the word, the first part of the word is Latin for \"herb\", and the second part, or \"ta\" (herba-ta), is simply the Polish name of the Chinese name for tea, Chinese word for tea, for plant. And it is more similar to those words in languages \\u200b\\u200bwe know, such as for example the English \"tea\". This is our \"ta\". Tea. So if we wanted to translate it literally, in Polish we have something like \"tea herb\". Such a word. It is not so strange when you look at the history of tea in Poland, because tea was initially treated by Poles more as a medicine, not a drink that you can enjoy. Tea was brought to Poland in the 17th century by a French woman, it was the wife of the Polish king. We know this because the king in a letter to his wife, that is to the queen, to this French woman, wrote, asked how to make tea, how to brew tea, that is how to prepare it, because he did not know himself. And it was the first time that tea was mentioned in Polish culture, in Polish history. Of course, tea was not yet popular in those years. As I said, many people treated it as medicine. Interestingly, many people treated it like poison. At the same time in Poland, people started drinking coffee, and coffee very quickly became much more popular than tea. In fact, it was only in the 19th century that large amounts of tea from Russia were brought to Poland, and then it began to be drunk on a massive scale. Because of course, if there were large amounts of tea, it also meant that it was much cheaper. It was no longer a good that could only be associated with salons, it became something for everyone. However, the way we drink it and our tea drinking habits come from the times of the Polish People\\'s Republic, i.e. the times when Poland was under the communist government. This method, the way we drink tea, was then brought from Russia, it came from Russia. So how do we drink tea? I\\'m talking about history, about everything, but still haven\\'t said about how we drink this tea. It is probably best to illustrate it with such a scene. Imagine that you are going to a Pole, to a Polish home. You are visiting a Polish person. Certainly, if this is an older person, they will ask you right away if you want to drink tea. It doesn\\'t matter what time it is: it may be morning, it may be noon, it may be afternoon, it may be evening. Whether you are before or after lunch, before dinner, or after dinner, this person will suggest you to drink some tea. Some people in Poland actually drink tea just like in other countries they drink water. That is, with every meal, at any time. It is not strange to drink tea with lunch or dinner, for example. If you agree to drink tea in the Polish house where you are at the moment, you will surely get sugar in it. That is, the person you are with will offer you some sugar for tea. They won\\'t offer you milk. In Poland it is still quite strange, weirdly perceived to drink milk with tea. Of course, I am talking especially about the older generations that are not used to it. Young people rather know that in other countries, whether Eastern or Western, tea is drunk differently. But I think the older generation might be shocked that, not everyone of course, but some, that we can ask for milk for tea. But you will definitely get sugar. And apparently this sweetening custom also comes from Russia. Apparently Chinese restaurateurs in Poland do not tolerate it. I read somewhere on the Internet that Chinese restaurateurs do not want to import better-quality tea from China, because they know that guests, people who come to restaurants will spoil the taste of tea with sugar. That is, they will sweeten the tea and thus the tea will not taste as it should, it will lose its flavor. So I do not know if we can talk about any particular culture of tea drinking in Poland, rather about the lack of this culture, or about the fact that we are ignoring the culture of drinking tea a bit. But tea still has an important place in our lives. Apparently, as many as 98% of Poles admit that they drink tea regularly. We mostly drink it at home. Poles rather do not drink tea at work or in a cafe. Maybe now also more often, because this tea is different. But research shows that Poles drink tea mainly in the morning, in the afternoon or in the evening, i.e. at times when they have finished their work, have returned home or have not left the house yet, if it is in the morning. However, there is not much research on this subject either, because as I said, there is no tea-drinking culture in Poland. I mean, we don\\'t have a culture like the English do, for example. We also usually associate tea with something homemade, with something that we do at home and therefore we rarely order it, for example, in a cafe. For a long time myself, I had such a habit that I never ordered tea in a cafe, because tea was something for me that I can easily make at home. Maybe it is a bit different with coffee, but... Of course, with tea too, but we are perhaps not aware of it. I think that tea has potential in Poland, that is, it could become something more important than it is now. I read on one of the tea blogs, i.e. blogs, where a person interested in this topic described how we drink tea in Poland and that this Chinese tea drinking culture would be... would fit Poland. It would fit the habits of Poles. Tea in Chinese culture is said to be something that fosters relationships, that is, it strengthens, that is, makes them more durable, makes them more important. And you? Do you like drinking tea and if so, how do you drink it and when? Is there any specific tea drinking culture in your country? Is it drunk in a certain way, at a specific time? Or maybe you prefer to drink coffee in your country? And what do you prefer to drink: do you prefer to drink coffee or do you prefer to drink tea? Be sure to let me know in the comments what you like to drink and what the situation looks like in your country. I would love to find it out. In Poland, it is possible that this will change. We\\'ll see. For now, it is as it is and this is what I wanted to describe to you. Because I was visiting my grandparents recently and noticed how often tea was offered and thought it was a great idea to present this tea drinking culture. I hope you found it equally interesting. And now, when you are in Poland, in some Polish home and you are offered tea, you will not think that it is anything strange or surprising. Thank you so much for making it until here, I remind you once again that you can find the transcript on my website, you can also find this podcast on YouTube with subtitles in Polish and English, as well as on various platforms such as Spotify or Google Podcasts. Also remember about my subscriptions, because I think it\\'s a fun exercise, one that we can do after listening to a podcast or watching a video, so I recommend it to you very much. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. You can also find my e-mail on my website, you can also contact me on Instagram or Facebook. Thank you very much again and you will hear me again in the next episode of this podcast. Bye Bye!',\n",

THEY'RE LOOKING AT STATE SECRETS. THEY'RE ALSO I MEAN, POINT IS A MEMBER OF NATO AND THEY'RE OUT A LOT OF POLAND.

AND SO FOR THOSE YOU KNOW, I DEFINITELY THINK THAT THOSE ARE THE PRIMARY ONES. LAUREN MAGIERA: AND NO ONE MEAN, THE PRESIDENT RIGHT NOW IN BELGIUM, THE STAKES ARE HIGH FOR IN THIS IN THIS TRIP RIGHT NOW FOR WEEKS INTO THE WAR. HOW HOW? HOW I GUESS MY QUESTION IS HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S SAFETY ABOUT THESE DIPLOMATIC TALKS AND WHERE ELSE RUSSIA MAY HAVE SPIES. I'M KEEPING AN EYE ON EXACTLY WHAT'S BEING SAID. I THINK WE'RE DEFINITELY KEEPING AN EYE ON WHAT'S GOING ON. BUT OUR SECRET SERVICE, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE SOME OF THE BEST AND PROTECTION PERSPECTIVE. AND SO I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT OUR PRESIDENT'S SAFETY, BUT FOR SURE THE RUSSIANS ARE GOING TO WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THESE TALKS. YOU KNOW, IT'S PROBABLY A TOP TIER. INFORMATION GATHERING PERSPECTIVE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO KNOW AND HAVE SOME INSIGHT INTO. THIS WITH THE EXPERTS TALKED TO EARLIER ABOUT DESTABILIZING POLAND. IS THAT A REAL THREAT IN POLAND AND OTHER NATO NATIONS THAT NEIGHBOR UKRAINE. THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT IT AND THEY'RE PROBABLY TAKING IT AS A REAL POTENTIAL THREAT. YOU KNOW, EVEN BEFORE THE TO RUSSIA ACTUALLY INVADING GOVERNMENT AND ANOTHER ALLIES THEY WERE SAYING THIS IS HAPPENING. THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN. AND THEN THE RUSSIANS KEPT COMING BACK AND SAYING NO, YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE DOING. THIS IS JUST AN BEHOLD, YOU KNOW, THE RUSSIANS STARTED DATING UKRAINE. AND SO I THINK AT THIS EVERY COUNTRY IN THAT REGION, THEY'RE GOING TO BE CONCERNED. THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK INWARD AND SAY, YOU KNOW, ARE WE READY TO PROTECT OURSELVES. ARE WE READY TO DEFEND OURSELVES. DO WE HAVE THE NECESSARY, YOU KNOW, SECURITY PROCEDURES AND POLICIES AND PROCESSES IN PLACE TO MAKE THAT, YOU KNOW, WE'RE PROTECTING OURSELVES AND WE'RE BEING PROACTIVE AND WE'RE BEING PREVENTATIVE THAN AND INTERCEPTING THAT INFORMATION. SO CRITICAL RIGHT NOW. RYAN HILLSBOR, APPRECIATE\",\n",

city in poland\\xa0\\nbehind warsaw 1.7 million people live here oh they're feeding the pigeons that's\\xa0\\nwhy the pigeons are out in full force i'm working on my polish okay\\xa0\\nthat's the marionette key\\xa0\\xa0 it's a big cathedral some of you have requested\\xa0\\nthat i actually start going into those\\xa0\\xa0 again kind of do a loop around this little\\xa0\\nsquare here but the thing that's different about\\xa0\\xa0 krakow than warsaw is that [Music] 85\\xa0\\nof warsaw was destroyed during the war world war ii most of krakow remained intact cause i don't know try not to miss any angles here there's\\xa0\\nso much going on down in this little\\xa0\\xa0 area right here what a cool place huh so we're\\xa0\\njust going to cruise around the old town here i\\xa0\\xa0 actually got a hotel here usually i stay at hilton\\xa0\\nor marriott but i decided this time no i will stay\\xa0\\xa0 right in the heart of it all makes\\xa0\\nthings easy so here is a look at my hotel 75 night hotel [Applause] i actually leave it four in the morning\\xa0\\nso this works perfect because it's right\\xa0\\xa0 next to the train station let's see what's in this building here if

indoor mall we'll just kind of cruise right through here huh we got shops so i'll be honest with you i\\xa0\\nreally enjoyed um warsaw but but uh i really like krakow [Music] so i would say if you uh wanted me to rank them\\xa0\\nso far i'm giving crack off the tip of the cap\\xa0\\xa0 just just because it's that good i'm looking to try and get on the sleeper train at midnight if i can to prague this was actually intended to be just\\xa0\\na quick layover but now that i'm here\\xa0\\xa0 i'm like i don't know if this might even be\\xa0\\nbetter in prague i've been to prague before as you guys know prague is considered\\xa0\\none of the best cities in all of europe this one here is just i mean what am i going to compare it to munich what do we got going on here man there's so much action here i don't\\xa0\\neven need to cut chop and edit anything out\\xa0\\xa0 it's like there's so much\\xa0\\nvibrance going on here i did eat\\xa0\\xa0 some good lunch today so maybe that's\\xa0\\nwhat's got me in such a great mood\\xa0\\xa0 arizona drinking food let's give it a\\xa0\\nwhirl [Music] salitos margarita [Music]\\xa0\\xa0 okay so the good food showed up i\\xa0\\ngot the steak fries and some salad\\xa0\\xa0 with my of course margaritas\\xa0\\narizona style nice steak oh yeah i'm going on here oh animals [Music] there's a lot of area around this uh old\\xa0\\ntown but most of this remained intact\\xa0\\xa0 after world war ii compared to warsaw warsaw got\\xa0\\ndestroyed this one most of it was left intact okay i'm gonna have to say compared to\\xa0\\nall the cities that i've been so far\\xa0\\xa0 this one's probably number one of all the cities\\xa0\\ni went on this tour between norway oslo stockholm\\xa0\\xa0 i really like stockholm um copenhagen there's a big castle down here that you\\xa0\\ngotta go to it's like the number one castle\\xa0\\xa0 i'll go back into that square and\\xa0\\ngo to the marinacci the the uh\\xa0\\xa0 church cathedral later but i\\xa0\\nwant to do this walk for you guys so you know what to expect when you come here\\xa0\\xa0 they have these in vienna i\\xa0\\nremember i seen these in vienna wow man let me just show you this wow what an incredible city this one is i was\\xa0\\nactually told by some people that they love\\xa0\\xa0 this this one but i had no idea what to expect\\xa0\\ni i you know you get recommendations from people and then you actually go there and\\xa0\\nyou're like what the heck look at this\\xa0\\xa0 well some of you guys asked about\\xa0\\npublic transportation there it is\\xa0\\xa0 we got a tram like i said i rode the train in\\xa0\\ni i want to call it a high speed i mean i felt\\xa0\\xa0 like at times it was going high speed i felt at\\xa0\\ntimes it was going regular speed like maybe 55 so but i would say overall that\\xa0\\nwas probably a high speed train\\xa0\\xa0 the train station in warsaw was\\xa0\\npretty crazy that was incredibly busy you guys can actually watch that\\xa0\\nvideo because i'm going to post it\\xa0\\xa0 on vertcam my other channel you can\\xa0\\nsee the whole experience i actually\\xa0\\xa0 wrote business class because that was\\xa0\\nall they had available was first class so there's a castle down here\\xa0\\nwhich is where i'm headed next\\xa0\\xa0 it's right on the river this is the same\\xa0\\nriver that's actually connected to warsaw before they had actual road highways rivers\\xa0\\naround the world were considered the first\\xa0\\xa0 highways those were the real highways before\\xa0\\ncars came about so you could take a boat\\xa0\\xa0 along the river and the river does most of\\xa0\\nthe pushing unless you're going upstream it's way easier to go downstream than a river wow you guys haven't already subscribed to this\\xa0\\nchannel and you like videos like this go ahead and\\xa0\\xa0 do that because i'm right in the heart of europe\\xa0\\nduring the peak season and we're going south well after prague we're going to start going south that includes hungary i've never been\\xa0\\nto hungary that includes slovakia\\xa0\\xa0 greece and then into the balkans well before i get\\xa0\\nto greece i got to go through the balkans right so croatia it's all on the on the to-do list i've got my energizer bunny\\xa0\\npack on as i'm traveling around and i'll pick up when i get to the i say\\xa0\\nenergizer bunny because it does take some\\xa0\\xa0 stamina to do this much traveling i did most\\xa0\\nof canada now i'm doing a lot of year up here\\xa0\\xa0 i usually do the western part of europe so\\xa0\\ninstead of doing the west i'm doing the east but it does require stamina this morning i almost\\xa0\\ndecided to take a day off but i was like no\\xa0\\xa0 i gotta go crack off and i'm glad\\xa0\\ni made that decision but i almost\\xa0\\xa0 took a day off i do need a day off\\xa0\\nsoon though let's see here what is this so much going on over here [Music] hello all right we're coming up\\xa0\\nto the castle zamac krolesky this is considered by many to be the main\\xa0\\nthing to see and do when you come to poland i mean if you come to krakow but also i would say\\xa0\\nthat a lot of people really recommend going to the\\xa0\\xa0 concentration camp of auschwitz-birknow\\xa0\\ni'm not going to be going over there\\xa0\\xa0 because i'm pushing south well actually i will have to come back for that it's i've seen youtube\\xa0\\ndocumentaries from other youtubers\\xa0\\xa0 who did a full tour of that place and\\xa0\\nit felt like i was there literally\\xa0\\xa0 kind of like what you guys feel\\xa0\\nwhen you watch these videos okay i may have found the entrance but even\\xa0\\nthen it looks like there's a ticket required it's my first time here there's those vines\\xa0\\nup close okay now i'm getting portugal vibes\\xa0\\xa0 oh there's mountains around here\\xa0\\noh this place is fantastic wow oh my gosh those vines amazing\\xa0\\xa0 how old is that like one planter\\xa0\\nit's got to be more than one plant there's got to be one plant covering\\xa0\\nthe whole building thankfully it's brick yesterday was rain and warsaw\\xa0\\nthis time of day it was beautiful sunny warm afternoon and bam in came the rain and dried up all the sun oh\\xa0\\nyou can go in the visitor center here let's see i was like do i just walk around the whole\\xa0\\nthing here or there an entrance let's see\\xa0\\xa0 oh there is the tickets you got to stand in line\\xa0\\nsee if i can get you a price at least i'm more\\xa0\\xa0 interested in going to the waterfront right now\\xa0\\nbut if i had more time i would explore this place okay if anyone knows how much it costs\\xa0\\nto go in there there's no sign oh man look at that oh wait did i just walk in\\xa0\\nwithout getting a ticket okay so this is all you can walk around here for\\xa0\\nfree but if you wanted to go inside the actual\\xa0\\xa0 church or any of these it's like\\xa0\\nindividual tickets for each building\\xa0\\xa0 and there's about six or seven\\xa0\\ndifferent tickets that you can buy for example to go in one of these buildings\\xa0\\nit might be like seven dollars or six euro wow and by the way thank you to victoria she's\\xa0\\nfrom ukraine she's been here for three months\\xa0\\xa0 she works at the castle very helpful\\xa0\\ntold me a lot of different things\\xa0\\xa0 it was very useful for me\\xa0\\nlook how beautiful this is wow is that like brass or bronze\\xa0\\nit's an incredible castle there's the astronomical clock or just regular\\xa0\\nclock i think every clock's astronomical oh look at that green door like a copper door\\xa0\\nthat did not look like paint that looked like\\xa0\\xa0 green metal incredible structure this is okay there's mariniski land right up there on the bell tower whenever you see these really flat stones like\\xa0\\nthis compared to the cobblestone that's usually\\xa0\\xa0 put there because they would take stage\\xa0\\ncoaches on that this is a stagecoach pass cobblestone in between walking paths kids love this place so funny they're just so excited to walk up and down it or slide down these rocks here oh wow they got archery oh almost at the target but we're coming up to the uh waterfront here\\xa0\\xa0 so the vestula river also connects\\xa0\\nto warsaw like i said previously let's get up on this waterfront here all right\\xa0\\nso we're gonna go on the river here and they\\xa0\\xa0 have these little boats that go up and down\\xa0\\nthe river i'm gonna try and get on one here\\xa0\\xa0 so let's go down there oh here comes the boat okay what's down there it's open it's okay let's just walk around up here okay [Music]\\xa0\\xa0 this one looks a little bit better than the one\\xa0\\nthey were originally gonna put me on [Music] i'm gonna get a drink it's a nice little spot right\\xa0\\nhere below decks actually all right let's go check out what's going on she's driving dude [Music] trying out all aspects of this boat here\\xa0\\xa0 okay so we are back out onto the\\xa0\\nwaterfront here along the river it's a good way to relax drink a beer and that sheraton's in a interesting placement it's a big boat right there man i currently have a blister on the back of\\xa0\\nmy foot and the reason is is because when i got\\xa0\\xa0 new socks they were real thin compared to the\\xa0\\nnike socks that i was wearing before like the\\xa0\\xa0 nice sports athletic socks i just got\\xa0\\nsome regular black socks in sweden\\xa0\\xa0 and they are not made for walking and the shoes\\xa0\\nthat i got they just between the new shoes\\xa0\\xa0 and the socks so i'm kind of\\xa0\\nlike walking with a bit of a limp but it only it's only bad when i've been sitting\\xa0\\nfor a little while and i start walking again\\xa0\\xa0 once i start walking i just kind of becomes\\xa0\\ncallous so i don't know if i want to pop it\\xa0\\xa0 or wait for it to just become\\xa0\\na callous or what we'll see oh there's a little nice area on the\\xa0\\nwaterfront and back up towards the castle\\xa0\\xa0 got some good vibes going on down here bubble man kids love the bubble man oh man are you feeling bubbly you want\\xa0\\nto drink some bubbly champagne okay i'm kind of taking the\\xa0\\nback road back here pod well in sure that's not how you say it but this is like\\xa0\\na park here nice little green zone with some\\xa0\\xa0 construction going on but we'll keep cruising\\xa0\\nthis little path back since it's different than\\xa0\\xa0 the way i came in all right coming back over to\\xa0\\nthe square here let's see what else we can find that was just nuts just came roaring through here\\xa0\\xa0 watch this watch how fast these\\xa0\\nguys come through here watch this that's nothing compared to the last guy and the last guy in a fire truck he came the guy the first guy in the fire\\xa0\\ntruck came through here like incredibly fast i mean i was like dude you should have saw people were like\\xa0\\npanicked to get out of the way that guy must be a five alarm fire or something\\xa0\\xa0 man we are in prime time in europe\\xa0\\nright now this is an absolute prime time i knew once i got out of scandinavia\\xa0\\nthings were going to light up like this\\xa0\\xa0 scandinavia was like relaxed compared to this and even scandinavia was intense\\xa0\\xa0 but the weather out here is

refreshed today we're heading to\\xa0\\xa0 a local park there's going to be it\\xa0\\nlooks like there's like a couple of\\xa0\\xa0 things there to do yeah so we're going\\xa0\\nto go check and just see what it's about\\xa0\\xa0 we've also got um a couple of things\\xa0\\nplanned for later we've head into\\xa0\\xa0 it looks like a really nice restaurant yeah uh and\\xa0\\nthen we are headed to a vodka bar which is highly\\xa0\\xa0 recommended in the videos yeah uh in the comment\\xa0\\nsection so we're gonna go check out the vodka bar\\xa0\\xa0 and try some different vodka flavors so that\\xa0\\nshould be really fun yeah really excited for that um we have made it to park h jordana they've got some\\xa0\\nrules no fireworks no fires no drinking no litter and whatever that is yeah we're gonna\\xa0\\ncheck it out yeah looks it's been it\\xa0\\xa0 snowed overnight last night so it looked\\xa0\\nreally tuning in still a little bit of snow so we're just gonna have a walk around and see\\xa0\\nwhat we come across what's on offer in park jordan\\xa0\\xa0 they've got like loads of these statue\\xa0\\nheads going down in like a big circle\\xa0\\xa0 there's a little bit of information but\\xa0\\nthey kind of remind me of the if they've\\xa0\\xa0 seen haunted mansion the film they kind of\\xa0\\nremind me of the statue heads there they sing uh yeah the statue heads in the film\\xa0\\nsing that not the ones in the park uh the statues seem to go all around\\xa0\\nwe can't tell if they're like um\\xa0\\xa0 where they're buried but it seems\\xa0\\nto be like one big memorial to\\xa0\\xa0 um just like soldiers and stuff from the wall yeah\\xa0\\nthere was like all sizes they'd use another water\\xa0\\xa0 like authors and soldiers just a\\xa0\\nbunch of important people i guess\\xa0\\xa0 okay there looks as if there's some sort of\\xa0\\nlittle cafe coming up here yeah coffee shop\\xa0\\xa0 um there's a couple of like kids play things\\xa0\\nand there's just this massive polar bear and be reindeer last one to think about we got we've just come to this spot now it seems\\xa0\\nthere's some sort of like outdoor like laid orbit which i guess would normally be filled up with\\xa0\\nwater in the summer but they've obviously empty\\xa0\\xa0 yeah and i think there's some like seats up there\\xa0\\nthere's some changes here and there seems to be a\\xa0\\xa0 big stadium here i'm not sure who plays in\\xa0\\nit but it's fairly big so i'm assuming it's\\xa0\\xa0 one of like krakow's main teams i'll have a look\\xa0\\nnow hey uh where's lovely there whizzler of izzler and you've got this big park area it's\\xa0\\nlike pretty big climbing from there yeah you can imagine this place is quite\\xa0\\nbusy in the summer oh yeah definitely okay sometimes class we're just back in the\\xa0\\napartment now just chilling out we've got about\\xa0\\xa0 40 minutes before we are headed to the vodka\\xa0\\nbar um and we're on 999 subscribers so we just so we just uh we've got it up on the\\xa0\\nlive thing wait till you go to a thousand\\xa0\\xa0 which might be like a half hour but we got enough\\xa0\\njust in case would be cool to see it don't go to\\xa0\\xa0 a thousand more but um yeah we're gonna head\\xa0\\nto the vodka bar so we're gonna get ready\\xa0\\xa0 and head out and try some different flavor\\xa0\\nvodkas yeah let's get wrecked here we've just

wanna make you mine loads of different flavors of vodka so we've got okay it's stronger than i thought it was going\\xa0\\nto be i thought it was going to be like weaker but it is actually quite strong i'm going to try\\xa0\\nthe chocolate one now this one's really thick i mean it's nice he just said give me a bunch of\\xa0\\ntraditional ones and we didn't look\\xa0\\xa0 when he was pouring them so we don't\\xa0\\nknow what that one is in the freezer i don't know what it is is someone in the comments actually recommended\\xa0\\xa0 elderberry i thought it was\\xa0\\ngoing to be like elder flowers we're just gonna like try all these um so\\xa0\\napparently it's like disrespectful to just\\xa0\\xa0 shorter so you sit there and like properly\\xa0\\ntaste the vodka and stuff so we're gonna\\xa0\\xa0 try them all now and then we'll let you know\\xa0\\nwhat our favorite ones are which ones to avoid came in yeah whoever comes out of berry it was a\\xa0\\nvery good recommendation can you give me another\\xa0\\xa0 one please you want another one no i don't always\\xa0\\nno i don't want another one it was an experience but we are pretty much almost\\xa0\\ndone we've got a couple of uh the lightweights carbon one\\xa0\\nthe background one's quite nice we've come to a restaurant called rizzesnia\\xa0\\nand it's called ribs on fire so we've actually\\xa0\\xa0 ordered 2.5 kilograms of ribs between the\\xa0\\nfour of us so we'll show you when it arrives yes we've ordered 2.5 kilos of ribs and this\\xa0\\nis what it looks like and we've ordered some\\xa0\\xa0 fries as well to go there we got the bbq flavors\\xa0\\nthere's different flavors you could do barbecue\\xa0\\xa0 sweet chili maple and hoisin\\xa0\\ni think so let's give it a try that was like melt in your mouth it's so good it\\xa0\\nliterally just like falls off the bones so easily\\xa0\\xa0 okay we've been given some shots\\xa0\\ni don't know what it is probably okay one two three we're just gonna head to uh

       " \"Hey hey! Greetings from Warsaw, Poland's\\ncapital. Welcome to another Tip Thursday with me, Conor the Language Tsar so in\\ntoday's video we're gonna be diving into five things you should remember if\\nyou're gonna take a trip to Poland about Polish etiquette so let's get into\\ntoday's video! So when you guys are visiting a Polish\\nhome, it's important to remember to bring a gift whether that's gonna be\\nflowers and chocolates some alcohol for the host. I know that applies to a lot\\nof other countries but something that you should definitely remember here in Poland.\\nAnother thing to remember is never bring yellow chrysanthemums as a present as\\nthey're for funerals here. So that will definitely not go down well if you bring\\nthose as flowers. So other times you're gonna have to remember to bring a gift\\nto a Polish person is of course on their birthday, on Christmas and their name day.\\nTheir name has a saint and that saint has a particular day that's also a time to\\ngive gifts in Poland. So that's something that you mightn't have known because that's\\nnot as universal as say a birthday present or a Christmas present in\\nChristian countries. So during dinner Poles tend to toast a lot and drink a lot of\\nalcohol so if you don't drink alcohol then you're gonna have to say 'no' multiple\\ntimes because it's not the cultural norm here. So if you decide to bring a present\\nalcohol well vodka is always a good choices. So this is legendary vodka from\\nfrom Belarus, Царская Поляна. Okay. Now when you go to a\\nPolish dinner there's gonna be copious amounts of food there so definitely go\\non an empty stomach otherwise your host is gonna be\\na bit offended if you're not launching yourself into everything and tasting all\\nthe different dishes that they have here so of course pierogi are the famous\\ndumplings in Poland. You have bigos which is like a hunter stew you have I think\\nit's pronounced Zurek and I've probably butchered that which is the soup that I\\nhad. So some other things you're gonna have to be aware of that are\\ntraditionally Polish are cabbage, sausages, pork meat if you don't eat pork\\nthat's another thing to be aware of and ask your host what has pork it doesn't\\nhave pork of course but pork is a main staple of the diet here in Poland and\\noften all that is gonna be washed down by not just vodka but also by some\\nhomemade liqueurs. There's some with honey they're quite popular that I've\\ntasted. So to address Poles it's not customary to do so by their first name\\nunless you really know them quite well so you should be referring to\\nmost 'pan' for mister and 'pani' to a woman. Customs here in Poland, it's a little\\nless intimate than say North America where people use first names a lot sooner. Here\\nthey tend to be more formal in terms of their greetings and a handshake is the\\nnormal way to create men. So if you're on public transport then chivalry it's a lot\\nmore common here than it is maybe in countries like North America or Western\\nEurope. You were expected to give up your seat for maybe disabled,\\nobviously a pregnant lady but I think that's a property universal anyways and\\neven for just an un-pregnant, a normal woman, a lot of men will still give up\\ntheir seat. There's more of that chivalrous culture. It's maybe a little less common\\namongst younger people [but] definitely amongst older people and of course age\\nthat you let an older person take your seat on public transport if there's no\\nother seat available is still the norm here in Poland and in fact it's kind of\\ndying out but it used to be customary and it still is amongst older poles\\nto kiss a lady's hand when you meet them. Isn't that very chivalrous and a\\nromantic custom? So most poles follow Roman Catholicism and religious holidays\\nare national events here so they are observed and you're not going to find\\nshops open on Catholic holidays for example. So just be aware of what the\\nCatholic calendar is if you're gonna travel here so that you're aware that\\nyou know things mightn't be open. People may be observing religious ceremonies or\\nattending religious service services for example. They're at home with their\\nfamily because it's considered a family time like maybe during Easter and\\nChristmas are two the biggest Catholic events throughout the year and they will\\nof course mean that things are not operating as normal in the country so just be aware of that and be aware of when those events are taking\\nplace before you come. So following your feedback to my recent poll that I put\\nout on my Instagram, my Facebook and my Twitter accounts I've decided to change\\nup my free video course for traveling and to change it from a general course\\nwhich was 'Traveler not a tourist' to a more specific course for here in Central/Eastern Europe. I know Poland is not technically Eastern Europe\\nit's actually the eastern part of Central Europe but at the same time it's gonna\\nbe a course called 'How to survive a trip to Eastern Europe' if you want to receive\\nthat free gift just go to the link in the description below this video. Sign up\\nby email. Click the link in the confirmation email that you're going to\\nreceive and I will whisk that over to you for free, no obligation so if you\\nknow someone is actually gonna come here to Poland definitely share this video\\nwith them so that they are aware of some of the cultural differences that they\\nmay experience so that they're not too shocked and they can you know not offend\\nanyone here in Poland so that's it from today's video 'pa pa!' or 'bye, bye' from\\nWarsaw, Poland and I'll see you in the next video!\",\n",

       " 'How many foreigners of what origin actually live in Poland? We\\'ll find out that and much more right after the intro. Hello again and welcome to my YouTube channel. If you should stop by for the first time, I would be really happy if you subscribe to the channel and activate the bell immediately. Then you will always be notified when I upload a new video. Many, many, many thanks for that. But let\\'s go a bit more towards the main topic and talk about migration and the proportion of foreigners here in Poland. I recently had a very interesting conversation with a friend I met through my channel . This is Micah. So greetings go out to Micha here as well. Michael asked me if I knew what the immigration figures were like in my region. So now for German or generally for foreigners. Somehow I could n\\'t really answer the question completely because I didn\\'t know that until then. Then I started to do a little research and see if I could find out anything about the percentage of foreigners and immigration here in my region. Then I came across a very, very interesting site and even an official government site where we have really, really interesting statistics. Well, first of all we can see there how many foreigners, let me say what kind of foreigners, that is, the origin of the foreigners, live in Poland. What status they have, what age they are, what gender they are and so on and immediately. We can even do comparisons like immigration in 2022 versus immigration in 2015. It\\'s all really visible here. This is also an official government website. In order not to keep you in suspense any longer, I\\'ll just show you my screen so that you even know what I\\'m talking about. So I think you can hear that too. I\\'m really, really excited about the site. So really euphoric. Whenever I saw that, it really had a, I have to say, a small WOW effect for me, what I get to see here. And this is the page migracje.gov.pl The \"gov\" is the abbreviation for government, which translates as state means I\\'ll say it now. So we also see that it is a state side. On the site we also have a choice of three languages. Polish, English and Russian. Let\\'s stick with Polish. I think Polish will be my stronger language out of the three languages. Let\\'s just go to the first statistic here. Click here. And although we already have the portfolio of Poland here. So the map of Poland divided into the whole województwa. Depending on where we go, we also see what kind of województwa that is. Here we have eg Zachodniopomorskie. Here we are in Lubuskie. Here Pomorskie and so on and immediately. Here in the circle, the number I\\'m in here. This is actually the number of foreigners in the województwa that is being presented here. E.g. myself, I live in the województwa Łódzkie. Here we have 44843 foreigners. If we just click on it now, we\\'ll have the first statistics. So this is now województwa Łódzkie, year 2022. Of the 44,843 foreigners we have here...... ....is this also subdivided here, how many, for example, here a \"pobyt czasowy\" that means a temporary stay to have. Here, for example, there are 37,513. Or a \"pobyt stałe\" that is here a permanent residence of 4206. There are also some terms here that I may not, I would say, fully understand. Or can not quite understand. But that has nothing to do with the language. Because I just don\\'t understand what that means. For example, down here we also have Ochrona uzupełniająca, which translates to don\\'t know, something like supplementary protection. So I do n\\'t understand in what context someone should get supplementary protection. If maybe there is someone here from my viewers who knows about it. Or maybe even work at the office here in Poland? Or maybe have any contacts? please contact me I would like to have a chat with this person. And maybe a little more detail on these things here. This is really quite interesting here. We\\'ll go into that in a moment and really filter where how many Germans live in which województwa most. But let\\'s look further here. Then we also see age here, for example. How many are under 20 here. For example, we have 26,000 foreigners between the ages of 20 and 39. For example, we have 60 over 80-year-olds. Then we now also have the gender that we can filter. This is where we start, for example, and this is just the województwa Łódzkie. Here we have also divided it into countries, which type or origin of foreigners live in this województwa. We currently have 27,164 Ukrainians here. Then on the second place we have people from Belarus. Here we have, for example, somewhere, there were also Germans. Right here Niemcy. This is German translated. Here, for example, a województwa Łódzkie we have 223 Germans live. We can now also, let me say, filter in a completely different way. Maybe we can click this away now. Is it_ wait a minute.... wait a minute... Alright, let\\'s do it again. Now we have a page here too. And now, for example, we can do it here too.... Unfortunately, you have to be able to speak Polish for that. We can go to \"kraj\" here. \"Kraj\" means land. We can just say \"Never\" for Niemcy here, for example. Abbreviation Niemcy. So, let\\'s hit the road. Now it shows us where, how many Germans live in which województwa. Here we can see very clearly. In the województwa \"zachodniopomorskie\" that is up by the sea. So that\\'s where we have most of the Germans living. The most German living. Here we have around 6102 Germans. You can also click on it. That is now here in general I see straight. Or? Yes, exactly! That\\'s just in general here now. But okay. I actually wanted to show you something else. Let\\'s move on to something else. Let\\'s do it again here. Or exactly, I\\'ll show you something completely different. Let\\'s just go to \"wykresy\" here. We have a folder up here. And here have \"wykres\". And here I can now also enter, for example..... ..... Niemcy. And here we now see from the Germans. Here, for example, we now have 16,444 Germans and of these 16,444 Germans from the year 2022..... So there is another thing that I don\\'t quite understand here. Because actually German citizens are citizens of the European Union. It also says, for example, Registered Citizens of the European Union. Permanent residency, i.e. registered citizens with permanent residency of the European Union. Then we only have permanent residence here. But I am of the opinion that every citizen from Germany is a citizen of the European Union. But well, let\\'s just move on. Then we have that here too, for example how many Germans live here. That\\'s 18,000 Germans. So now all over Poland we have 18,000 Germans living here. Here it is shown again in a bar chart. How many Germans live in which województwa. So very interesting here. Now we can make a comparison, for example. For example 2022 with the year let\\'s say 2015. This will probably take a few seconds now. Exactly, down here we see the ball loading here. So, and now we have here.... Actually, something should be flashing here for 2015. Exactly, and now we have, for example, a comparison between 2015 and 2022. In 2015 we had 7432 Germans, e.g. in the województwa \"Zachodniapomorskie\" and today we have 6102. Here we have another direct comparison between 2015 and 2022 by the German immigrants. So very very interesting here. Here we have the year again. Here we can then filter gender again. Let\\'s see the age of the Germans here again. We can also do Germans, for example, with I don\\'t know.... We can just do it... Let\\'s just take Germans and then we\\'ll add them as well... Can I choose something else here? For example, exactly, for example, we can now compare with the French. And now he should actually show us both countries. And then shows us the comparison right away. At least he should. He\\'s loading a bit here now. Wait a minute... Why isn\\'t he showing us this the way I\\'d like it to be? okay... But now we have here.... .....wait a minute. Do we just have to do it differently here? Now he should actually have us too...... Exactly and now we also have a comparison in the year 2022, for example. How many Germans have migrated here and how many French people have immigrated. So very very interesting. Now I\\'ll show you something really, really great that I\\'ve also found here. And we still have here..... Where was that now? A complete map. Where was that? Wait a minute... I have to click this away, exactly, and then we\\'ll go to \"Świat\" up here. \"Świat\" means world. Let\\'s click on this and now we have a world map. Now we can see from this world map, for example, if we now click on a certain country, we just saw we had about 18000 Germans in Poland. And if we now look at Germany, for example... Here we also see the 18,000. So now here under exports we see 18,046 Germans living in Poland. For example, if we click on Poland, obviously nothing. Now, for example, we have Belarusians 61,000. Here we have 387,000 Ukrainians. We also have Russians here. I just allowed myself to have fun and then just looked. Then I also looked here at North Korea. So there really are 5 North Koreans in Poland. So that\\'s really an insanely cool statistic. Personally, I\\'m really excited about the statistics. Here you can really filter everything and so on and immediately. Here also with this bar chart. Really, to me that\\'s just really awesome. I don\\'t know if there is something like that from Germany. At least I don\\'t know of anything like that in Germany. Here we also have something very interesting for people. Here I also have official pages, for example from immigration authorities, I think that should be the case now. And here we also have addresses of immigration authorities from all over Poland. Where are they, with their address, and so on and immediately. Here for example Łódź Piotrkowskas. That\\'s where I live. This is also an Office for Foreigners Affairs and Citizenships. So as said. I would be interested to know if there is something like this in Germany. At least I don\\'t know of anything like that in Germany. I would be interested in what you personally say about this statistic. So I\\'m really excited about this statistic. I think you can see that too. I can hardly hold myself here. I would be really interested in your opinion on this topic. Anyway, thank you for watching my video to the end. I would be very happy about a LIKE and a subscription. If you liked this video, feel free to share it with your friends if you feel like it. And if you don\\'t want to, you don\\'t have to. I\\'m also really, really open to negative criticism. Even if you give a thumbs down. I really have no problem with that. But I would also be happy if you give me a thumbs down, maybe you can also leave me a comment why you actually do it. I always try to improve my channel from time to time and also respond a little to the community and viewers. If I get dislikes, which is very seldom the case, but if I get a dislike, I would actually be interested in why I get it. With that in mind, I\\'m glad you watched my video to the end. Stay healthy and see you next time. Ciao',\n",
       " \"good morning from Warsaw guys I'm in Poland if you haven't figured it out my decision to come here stems from my background my parents are polish both of them are from Poland I'm born in the US so I'm an American with polish parents or in the US we just say polish American that's easy enough my parents are both from Poland and they spent a lot of time invested in making sure that I am familiar with what Poland is polish school on Saturdays dance groups that were polish polish folk dance that is growing up I spent a lot of my summers in Poland I basically came here every other year until I was 13 every time I came basically every time was with my parents so my view of Poland and my ideas about Poland are very much one sided sculpted through the eyes of my parents and the Polish community back in Chicago which was basically basically its roots its strongest roots are based in the 80s the fact that my whole view of Poland is very much one sided isn't something I realized until I met my polish friends in Tokyo like marching like Chris and then there are others as well but Chris of course was one of the bigger influences here and it kind of boggled my mind because I had this whole idea set for about 23 years I'm here for some of my own self-discovery as corny as that sounds that's what I'm doing here so I thought it'd be cool to show you guys Poland from a foreigners perspective that's me um there are some things that'll be pretty familiar for me some things that probably will really surprise me for all the Polish viewers please help me out as much as you can let me know if something awesome is going on and I would love to meet up with a lot of the viewers here so send me messages and I'll see if what I can organize here's a view of my window again it's very nice it's the Palace of Culture and science and it's the tallest building in Poland but more on that in another vlog my plan for today I'm going to workout first that I have to pop into the Japanese embassy then I'm going to edit the yesterday's vlog and then I'm gonna do shopping did my workout weightlifting followed by high intensity intervals I'm pretty pumped up now I have to go to the Japanese embassy I just picked up my new awesome Japanese business visa which makes me one of the first if not the first person from Poland with this type of visa in Japan it's funny but there's just not a lot of us in Japan this is my last day in Insadong tomorrow I'll be moving to Gangnam and I want to say this place where I'm staying this is the best hotel I've stayed at and they're not paying me to say this I just want you to know if you'll get a good price in this hotel like I did eighty dollars per night this is a steal there's the gym there's a swimming pool everything's included in the price the standards are very high and you get a whole apartment as opposed to just a hotel room so you have a kitchen and everything and the Insadong area is one of the best areas you can stay in in Seoul if you're a tourist because you're close to all the palaces you're close to Myung dong so shopping area you you're close to John GOG which is like a night entertainment area we're close to Insadong itself which is also interesting you can get to Itaewon pretty quick you can get to Honda pretty quick I just love staying here this is the best place I stay then that said before anything yesterday's episode I'm going to use the bathhouse so I found a place to eat it's not necessarily Polish food but I am way too hungry too freshly squeezed orange juice yayyy and a salad and some potatoes important things worth noting about Poland water is never free at restaurants you can get a SIM card almost anywhere for as little as like two dollars and then you got to load it up at this what that's not us at which I guess is golden pavilions and it seems like it's basically a big shopping malls I found a hair straightener this guy's got nothing on you Stu now I'm seeing Patrick and we're gonna do some shopping and food I'm really sad about having to leave this hotel tomorrow operation work egg kimchi darling three inputs so much when I go to Japan really this is a real this building behind me is a Myeongdong Cathedral it's one of the biggest Christian churches in Korea let's check it out Oh we incidentally stumbled upon a concert in the Cathedral it's an interesting place to see especially because of the paintings on the wall you can see Saints and wearing traditional Korean robes so I'm guessing Korean Saints it has to be noted that Christianity is the most popular I think religion in Korea Christian majority is Protestant but in Korean terms region is more syncretic so for example even though your católica in the present you would still you would still the Desa which is you know pay tribute to your ancestors so in Korean terms it's more mixed I'd say hey guys I'm just here looking at shoes because shoes finally fit me and I ran into ultra wrong I guess I'll be getting some of that now time for some groceries holy crap yoghurt selection in Poland is huge cheese cheese more cheese I got myself a jacket hair straightener SIM card and some

       " \"well now to the election in Poland the votes\\xa0\\nare in we now know the results so will Poland\\xa0\\xa0 dramatically change are we going to see a major\\xa0\\nshift perhaps a huge move away from NATO support\\xa0\\xa0 a dramatic change in Poland or more of the same\\xa0\\nMike Kupa is journalist in Warsaw Poland fantastic\\xa0\\xa0 friend of the show we're glad to have Mike back\\xa0\\nhe's the host of VM TV there in Poland uh Mike\\xa0\\xa0 so any big surprises for you or sort of more of\\xa0\\nthe same from what we saw can you walk us through\\xa0\\xa0 what EX ly happened well uh hello Clayton hello\\xa0\\neveryone once again it wasn't a surprise for me\\xa0\\xa0 I was uh I predicted from some time now that uh\\xa0\\nyou know Law And Justice uh the ruling party thus\\xa0\\xa0 far would win the elections but they wouldn't\\xa0\\nget a majority so the the fundamental question\\xa0\\xa0 everybody was asking uh even you know last\\xa0\\nweek was who with whom uh Law And Justice is\\xa0\\xa0 going to have to form a coalition now most of the\\xa0\\nobservers and analysts were saying that they would\\xa0\\xa0 most likely form a coalition with the party that\\xa0\\nis to the right of them that is a confederation\\xa0\\xa0 party I spoke about it a few times on your show\\xa0\\nhowever it turns out that uh while expectations\\xa0\\xa0 were very high for confederation some were even\\xa0\\nestimating back in the spring that they would get\\xa0\\xa0 about 15% of the vote it turns out they got just\\xa0\\nover 7% of the vote which gives them about uh 18\\xa0\\xa0 MPS right now in the current Parliament instead of\\xa0\\nthe projected originally uh you know 50 to 60 MPS\\xa0\\xa0 so that's a big blow to Confederation in order to\\xa0\\nhave a majority in the Polish Parliament you have\\xa0\\xa0 have to have 231 MPS peace does not have Law And\\xa0\\nJustice does not have that on its own so what's\\xa0\\xa0 going to happen now is the three next parties\\xa0\\nwhich are the three main opposition parties\\xa0\\xa0 which is the Civic platform led by uh Donald\\xa0\\nTusk uh then we have the so-called Third Way\\xa0\\xa0 which is basically an or a sort of conglomerate\\xa0\\nof these uh liberal lights uh and uh the so-called\\xa0\\xa0 peasant party so basically a party of uh farmers\\xa0\\nand the hard left the woke left party which is\\xa0\\xa0 called the left party basically in Poland they\\xa0\\nwill most likely be forming a coalition and they\\xa0\\xa0 will most likely be governing with Tusk as head of\\xa0\\ngovernment as prime minister so no big surprises\\xa0\\xa0 for me the only I guess surprise for me was I\\xa0\\nactually did expect Confederation to come out\\xa0\\xa0 slightly higher I thought they would get about 9%\\xa0\\nof the vote they got just over seven as I said so\\xa0\\xa0 uh yeah that's that's a loss for uh for Law and\\xa0\\nJustice it's a loss for confederation generally\\xa0\\xa0 for the rightwing in Poland and we are expected\\xa0\\nto have a left liberal uh very Pro woke and very\\xa0\\xa0 pro-eu uh Coalition coming up were you surprised\\xa0\\nby that I mean it seemed there was enormous it\\xa0\\xa0 seemed like there from the outside maybe there was\\xa0\\nenormous push back from sort of woke politics this\\xa0\\xa0 alignment with the European Union on a number\\xa0\\nof different issues the the alignment with NATO\\xa0\\xa0 of course the war in Ukraine this is seems Seems\\xa0\\nstriking here the problem with the new Coalition\\xa0\\xa0 is that uh they are just as Pro Pro Ukraine and\\xa0\\npro- Nat as Law And Justice except Law And Justice\\xa0\\xa0 was a little bit too fanatical so the current\\xa0\\nCoalition will be slightly less fanatical but\\xa0\\xa0 in terms of the general course of the sort of\\xa0\\natlanticist Institutions NATO and the European\\xa0\\xa0 Union they're going to tow the line except the\\xa0\\nonly thing that might change is they're not going\\xa0\\xa0 to be asking you know for a fight with Russia\\xa0\\nmaybe as much as Law And Justice did as a matter\\xa0\\xa0 of fact just before we came on I was actually\\xa0\\nlooking at uh the government record from the\\xa0\\xa0 previous prime minister ship Donald Tusk which\\xa0\\nis in the Years 2007 but 2015 and uh Tusk uh on\\xa0\\xa0 many occasions actually articulated a rational\\xa0\\npolicy towards Russia at least not a policy of\\xa0\\xa0 let's be the first ones let's not be the tip of\\xa0\\nthe spear in fighting Russia which peace which\\xa0\\xa0 the law and Justice government obviously was not\\xa0\\nthey were asking for a fight basically and the\\xa0\\xa0 only reason why in the last couple of weeks they\\xa0\\nchanged their tune regarding Ukraine especially\\xa0\\xa0 when it comes to the import of Ukrainian grain\\xa0\\nand issues pertaining to Ukrainian immigrants\\xa0\\xa0 was because they saw that Confederation which\\xa0\\nis the party to the right of them was actually\\xa0\\xa0 gaining on this issue talking about the refugee\\xa0\\nflow and talking about you know sending all our\\xa0\\xa0 military equipment to Ukraine and losing the\\xa0\\nwar in essence so uh there was a lot of people\\xa0\\xa0 that were fed up obviously the turnout which is\\xa0\\ninteresting was over 70% so that's a record after\\xa0\\xa0 1989 for Poland uh but I think a lot of people\\xa0\\nwere just fed up with uh two terms of the law\\xa0\\xa0 and Justice government because at some point uh\\xa0\\nthey really became uh you know uh enamored with\\xa0\\xa0 power and they just didn't care what anybody said\\xa0\\nabout them they thought they were really going to\\xa0\\xa0 govern for a third term and that just made them\\xa0\\nvery arrogant and a lot of people maybe didn't\\xa0\\xa0 look so much at the policy specifics as just get\\xa0\\nthem get them the hell out of there and we want to\\xa0\\xa0 see new faces in in government and I think a lot\\xa0\\nof it was based basically on emotion and not on\\xa0\\xa0 sound rational policy analysis what do you think\\xa0\\nthis means for the Ukrainian refugees in Poland\\xa0\\xa0 any change there on that policy because what is\\xa0\\nthe current number too we had over close to 3\\xa0\\xa0 million Ukrainian refugees that were were staying\\xa0\\nthere the ones that came here and are still here\\xa0\\xa0 after the ones that came after February 24th 2022\\xa0\\nit's estimated about 2 million so if you take that\\xa0\\xa0 2 million plus the 2 million around that were\\xa0\\nalready here before the War uh that's going to\\xa0\\xa0 create about 4 million I think with the amount\\xa0\\nof the ones that aren't declared the ones that\\xa0\\xa0 are here illegally are probably going closer to\\xa0\\nabout 5 million so I don't think their status quo\\xa0\\xa0 will change sadly I think what's going to happen\\xa0\\nright now is we're going to be seeing this policy\\xa0\\xa0 push for larger Multicultural multiculturalism in\\xa0\\nPoland and I wouldn't be surprised if in light of\\xa0\\xa0 this you know within a decade's time we're going\\xa0\\nto have a Ukrainian minority party in the Polish\\xa0\\xa0 Parliament and that's when you're going to know\\xa0\\nthat things are really gone uh down the train\\xa0\\xa0 for Poland um but uh it's interesting because you\\xa0\\nknow peace the lusti Called Peace in Poland they\\xa0\\xa0 were officially conservative even though they\\xa0\\nhad the most liberal uh Pol immigration policy\\xa0\\xa0 in all of the EU during their time more non-eu\\xa0\\npeople came into the EU to Poland specifically\\xa0\\xa0 than in any other European country and I'm talking\\xa0\\nabout obviously legal immigrants so despite the\\xa0\\xa0 rhetoric the borders were open uh the current uh\\xa0\\nthe forming Coalition is not going to change that\\xa0\\xa0 sadly um but I think that will only strengthen the\\xa0\\nopposition uh sort of on the streets and possibly\\xa0\\xa0 give new motivation for anti-immigration parties\\xa0\\nsomewhat like the Confederation to make new gains\\xa0\\xa0 in next year's local elections and the elections\\xa0\\nto the European Union which are scheduled for June\\xa0\\xa0 last year we saw polish citizens lined up with\\xa0\\ntheir cars getting coal from power plants that\\xa0\\xa0 were not even set up to really hand out coal to\\xa0\\nindividual citizens like taking your hatch back\\xa0\\xa0 and just filling up the trunk with chunks of coal\\xa0\\nto try to drive home with we now know of course\\xa0\\xa0 what's happening in the Middle East and of course\\xa0\\nthe push towards clean energy in Poland this is\\xa0\\xa0 is a big push in on the part of uh on the part\\xa0\\nof Poland you know we could see an energy crisis\\xa0\\xa0 uh facing facing Europe and facing Poland this\\xa0\\nuh into this winter given what's happened with\\xa0\\xa0 the Middle East so where do the Polish people\\xa0\\nsit right now on energy supplies fossil fuels\\xa0\\xa0 um can you talk a little bit about what you guys\\xa0\\nexpect to see there as we head into the colder\\xa0\\xa0 months the problem with the Coalition that's\\xa0\\ncoming in right now is they're even more green\\xa0\\xa0 than the other party that just lost the election\\xa0\\nnow whereas Law And Justice they pretended to be\\xa0\\xa0 very you know anti-woke you know in the climate\\xa0\\nagenda and so on and so on but in terms of signing\\xa0\\xa0 all the relevant documents in the European Union\\xa0\\nuh pertaining to fighting emissions and all that\\xa0\\xa0 stuff they signed everything but then they rort\\xa0\\nthey came back and said you know the European\\xa0\\xa0 Union forced us well the Coalition that's coming\\xa0\\nin right now they're not going to say that because\\xa0\\xa0 they're going to willingly sign up to everything\\xa0\\nof the climate agenda that the EU pushes so you\\xa0\\xa0 know electric cars and all that stuff and phasing\\xa0\\nout of coal so uh it's obviously not going to\\xa0\\xa0 happen from day to day and it'll be there will be\\xa0\\na lot of push back but if basically the government\\xa0\\xa0 that's coming in right now is about as crazy on\\xa0\\nthe climate change issue as the greens in Germany\\xa0\\xa0 especially the left party which is be forming\\xa0\\nmost likely this Coalition so I think they're\\xa0\\xa0 gonna that turned out really well for Germany by\\xa0\\nthe way yeah of course um but you know as as I\\xa0\\xa0 said uh I'm pretty sure that'll generate a lot\\xa0\\nof push back and I think Tusk is even you know\\xa0\\xa0 uh enough of a realist to know that yeah even if\\xa0\\nyou implement these globalist policies you have to\\xa0\\xa0 implement them in phases and incrementally whereas\\xa0\\nthe left is probably going to be pushing very much\\xa0\\xa0 to implement them quickly that way you can't you\\xa0\\nknow reverse anything once they lose power which\\xa0\\xa0 they surely will as I said we talked about this\\xa0\\nbefore we went on I think including the climate\\xa0\\xa0 agenda and the agenda in foreign policy and the\\xa0\\nwoke agenda that they will surely try to impose\\xa0\\xa0 on polish Society in the upcoming years and months\\xa0\\nuh I don't think this Coalition is going to last\\xa0\\xa0 too long I think there's too many differences and\\xa0\\ntoo many personal differences between them uh so\\xa0\\xa0 I'm giving them about 18 months you heard it here\\xa0\\nfor the first time before this Coalition collaps\\xa0\\xa0 and we're probably going to have early elections\\xa0\\nin Poland uh but one way or another giv 18 months\\xa0\\xa0 all right we'll hold you to that we'll keep a\\xa0\\nlittle countdown time 18 months before you're\\xa0\\xa0 going to have a civil war in the Coalition because\\xa0\\ndespite the fact that uh they're they're mainly\\xa0\\xa0 aligned on a lot of issues pertaining to social\\xa0\\npolicy and foreign policy but because there's so\\xa0\\xa0 much of the cake to give Iran right now once\\xa0\\nyou threw out the old Elite uh that's going\\xa0\\xa0 to generate a lot of conflict so who's going to go\\xa0\\ninto you know state-owned companies who's going to\\xa0\\xa0 go into state owned television who's going to take\\xa0\\nover the Ministries you know once you're dividing\\xa0\\xa0 a good cake everybody wants the bigger piece so\\xa0\\nI think that in essence and not so much policy\\xa0\\xa0 issues is going to be generating the conflicts\\xa0\\nthat eventually are going to lead to the you know\\xa0\\xa0 uh collapse of the Coalition I'll get you out of\\xa0\\nhere on this mic over the past few days since the\\xa0\\xa0 outbreak of war in Israel we've against the 17\\xa0\\nfactions there uh in in in in on the Palestinian\\xa0\\xa0 side you know everyone wants to paint this just\\xa0\\nas Hamas but it's very important to point out this\\xa0\\xa0 basically 17 different factions there there's been\\xa0\\na lot of memes go around on the internet about\\xa0\\xa0 Poland as you see London you see all of these\\xa0\\nprotests you see France uh there's been a lot of\\xa0\\xa0 memes floating around about Poland how you don't\\xa0\\nsee this in Poland can you talk can you talk about\\xa0\\xa0 that can you address why you would have 2 million\\xa0\\nUkrainian refugees but you don't see the type of\\xa0\\xa0 perhaps protest and crisis that you're seeing in\\xa0\\nLondon and and France and other EU countries right\\xa0\\xa0 now well I've seen the memes on Twitter I've seen\\xa0\\nthe ones you know oh look and this is Poland no\\xa0\\xa0 Hamas demonstrations no Palestine organizations no\\xa0\\nPro Palestine uh demonstrations well first of all\\xa0\\xa0 there was a pro Palestine demonstration in krou\\xa0\\nit wasn't as large as the one in London and in\\xa0\\xa0 other countries and it wasn't so maybe Muslim UPF\\xa0\\nfront but it did take place they had guys walking\\xa0\\xa0 around you know with the Arafat colors and the\\xa0\\nPalestinian flag so there was a demonstration\\xa0\\xa0 in KRA of which all those you know Outlets didn't\\xa0\\nreport on and the second thing is you know okay\\xa0\\xa0 we might not have a Muslim problem in Poland\\xa0\\nbut we sure as hell have a Ukrainian problem\\xa0\\xa0 in Poland and the same places that are shown in\\xa0\\nkov right now lacking in Muslim demonstrations\\xa0\\xa0 or po Palestine demonstrations you know almost\\xa0\\nevery single day since La last year there was a\\xa0\\xa0 permanent Ukrainian president beside the uh statue\\xa0\\nof Adam mitk in KRA of square now Adam mkich is\\xa0\\xa0 obviously a famous polish poet and playright\\xa0\\nand beside his statue you basically have this\\xa0\\xa0 Gathering of ukrainians standing with flags you\\xa0\\nknow screaming support AZ of support Ukraine and\\xa0\\xa0 that was basically on a permanent basis so after a\\xa0\\nwhile a couple of Polish people got angry Patriots\\xa0\\xa0 started protesting against his football Hooligans\\xa0\\nand so on and so on so I don't know if it's still\\xa0\\xa0 there but the ukrainians are the ones protesting\\xa0\\nin Poland and making their uh presence known so\\xa0\\xa0 you know when I saw the meme for the first time\\xa0\\nthey say oh look no Hamas demonstrations in Poland\\xa0\\xa0 I'm like yeah but you have as of demonstrations in\\xa0\\nPoland which pretty much to me amounts to the same\\xa0\\xa0 thing so I don't care uh the best thing would be\\xa0\\nto do not to have one or the other right um so I\\xa0\\xa0 think it's basically a meane to sort of you know\\xa0\\nit was I I I called you know I called Jack bobas\\xa0\\xa0 out on this on Twitter I said Jack stop shoing for\\xa0\\npeace you know for the law and Justice government\\xa0\\xa0 I mean they're just as pro-immigrant and Pro open\\xa0\\nborders just to the east not to the South because\\xa0\\xa0 bringing in Muslims on a huge you know number\\xa0\\nbasis like the ukrainians will still look bad\\xa0\\xa0 in the media right now in Poland it might change\\xa0\\nwith time but ukrainians hey what the hell at\\xa0\\xa0 least they're white right and they speak a similar\\xa0\\nlanguage but they're as detrimental to our culture\\xa0\\xa0 if not more uh and to our economy as the masses\\xa0\\nthat would come from the south so you know it's\\xa0\\xa0 just as I said it was just poor Shilling for\\xa0\\nthe ruling party and I understand where they're\\xa0\\xa0 coming from a lot of these people well thank\\xa0\\nyou for shining a light on this and telling us\\xa0\\xa0 the truth here you know it's very easy for these\\xa0\\nmemes to travel on the internet very quick and\\xa0\\xa0 Jack wants to tweet that kind of stuff and it\\xa0\\nmakes it seems like that's the truth but thank\\xa0\\xa0 you for sharing the

My place no. 71 at the window. Food can be ordered. Two drinks and a snack are free. I ordered water and coffee. They give candy with coffee. The name Pendolino is used to identify a family of high-speed, tilting-technology trains, produced in Italy.  These trains owe their name (pendolino can mean 'small pendulum' in Italian) to the mechanism enabling them to tilt when going round a curve. Unquestionable comfort. 2014, Polish State Railways started passenger service trains PKP Pendolino ED250 operating 200 km/h   High-speed tests were carried out with the new train in Poland. Pendolino reached 293 km/h. This is a new record for Polish railways. Tickets for the earliest train journey were at the lowest price. Let's see what the WC is like in this train. I like the colors of the toilet. 200 km/h speed. These trains are not reaching their potential. We arrive at the Warsaw Central Station. This is my stop. The train will continue to Gdynia.

       " 'In the heart of Europe, where industrial\\xa0\\ngiants have reigned supreme for decades,\\xa0\\xa0 a seismic shift is underway. Poland,\\xa0\\nonce in the shadow of Germany,\\xa0\\xa0 is now emerging as a direct threat to the\\xa0\\nthrone of Germany\\'s industrial supremacy. Today, we unveil a story of ambition,\\xa0\\ninnovation, and economic prowess as\\xa0\\xa0 Poland challenges the status quo and sets its\\xa0\\nsights on the peak of industrial greatness. Before we dive into the heart of this development,\\xa0\\xa0 make sure to like this video and\\xa0\\nsubscribe to Tech Revolution. Now, let’s get this video rolling. German fall? The federal statistics office recently\\xa0\\nreported a dip in German industrial\\xa0\\xa0 output, marking the fourth consecutive\\xa0\\nmonth of decline. This ongoing trend has\\xa0\\xa0 sparked concerns regarding a looming recession. The 0.2% decrease in industrial\\xa0\\nproduction in August surpassed\\xa0\\xa0 the predicted 0.1% decline set\\xa0\\nby analysts consulted by Reuters. Franziska Palmas, a senior Europe economist at\\xa0\\nCapital Economics, mentioned that this decline in\\xa0\\xa0 August was influenced by volatile elements, making\\xa0\\nit less concerning than initially perceived. However, she remains wary and expects\\xa0\\nthe downturn in industrial output to\\xa0\\xa0 continue due to high-interest\\xa0\\nrates and a demand reduction. \"We foresee a contraction in German GDP\\xa0\\nfor both the upcoming third and fourth\\xa0\\xa0 quarters,\" Palmas commented. Two consecutive\\xa0\\nGDP contractions define a technical recession. The statistics office adjusted its July data,\\xa0\\nindicating a 0.6% month-on-month decrease in\\xa0\\xa0 production compared to the initially reported\\xa0\\n0.8%. In a broader perspective, data revealed\\xa0\\xa0 a 1.9% drop in production from June to August\\xa0\\n2023 when compared to the three months prior. Several sectors influenced August\\'s overall\\xa0\\nperformance. There was a 2.4% decline in\\xa0\\xa0 construction, a 6.6% drop in energy, and a 2.3%\\xa0\\ndecrease in machinery and equipment manufacturing. In contrast, a silver lining appeared in\\xa0\\nthe automotive industry, which demonstrated\\xa0\\xa0 a 7.6% growth. When excluding the\\xa0\\nenergy and construction sectors,\\xa0\\xa0 the industry\\'s production in August\\xa0\\nsaw a 0.5% rise compared to July. Industrial orders showed an\\xa0\\nincrease of 3.9% in August,\\xa0\\xa0 primarily driven by the computing,\\xa0\\nelectronic, and optical products sector. Yet, Destatis highlighted the ongoing\\xa0\\nuncertainty in the industry\\'s overall outlook. Commenting on this trend, ING\\'s global\\xa0\\nhead of macro, Carsten Brzeski, said,\\xa0\\xa0 \"Despite the uptick, thin order\\xa0\\nbooks and significant inventories\\xa0\\xa0 hint at a continued stagnation\\xa0\\nof German industrial production.\" Germany\\'s manufacturing sector,\\xa0\\xa0 which constitutes roughly a fifth of its\\xa0\\neconomy, continues to face challenges. The HCOB final Purchasing Managers\\' Index for\\xa0\\nmanufacturing landed at 39.6 for September,\\xa0\\xa0 well below the pivotal 50-point mark\\xa0\\ndifferentiating growth from contraction. Brzeski further added, \"Retail sales, exports, and\\xa0\\nindustrial production showed disappointing results\\xa0\\xa0 in the early phase of the third quarter, implying\\xa0\\na significant risk of economic contraction. Poland in After the concerning trends in\\xa0\\nGerman industrial output and\\xa0\\xa0 the looming recession fears,\\xa0\\nanother story unfolds nearby. Germany\\'s challenges with\\xa0\\nidle factories last year,\\xa0\\xa0 primarily due to the spike in gas prices and\\xa0\\nthe repercussions of the Ukraine conflict,\\xa0\\xa0 have provoked deeper contemplation\\xa0\\non potential deindustrialization. While Germany grapples with concerns\\xa0\\nabout its competitive edge, Poland,\\xa0\\xa0 often termed Europe’s rising star, showcases\\xa0\\nits burgeoning manufacturing prowess. Over the past ten years, Poland has exhibited an\\xa0\\xa0 impressive 85% surge in output per\\xa0\\nindividual, amounting to $43,113,\\xa0\\xa0 as stated by the Organisation for\\xa0\\nEconomic Co-operation and Development. In comparison, Germany\\'s rise is at 46%,\\xa0\\nwith an average EU growth of 55% in the\\xa0\\xa0 same duration. The data reveals more:\\xa0\\na decade ago, Germany\\'s manufacturing\\xa0\\xa0 industry constituted 20.3% of its economic\\xa0\\nyield, which has now reduced to 18.5% by 2022. Poland, on the flip side, has bolstered its\\xa0\\nfactory output from 16.7% of its GDP to 17.7%.\\xa0\\xa0 Remarkably, this output has jumped from $101bn\\xa0\\nin 2019 to a whopping $122bn just last year. Tomas Dvorak, a senior economist at Oxford\\xa0\\nEconomics, comments on this phenomenon,\\xa0\\xa0 “Poland has witnessed a comprehensive\\xa0\\nsuccess story over the recent years.\\xa0\\xa0 It\\'s not just about the industrial sector; the\\xa0\\nentire economy has made commendable strides.\" He further adds that Poland might stand alone,\\xa0\\nnot just in Europe but potentially globally,\\xa0\\xa0 in surpassing its industrial production to\\xa0\\npre-pandemic figures. \"The last trio of years,\\xa0\\xa0 marked by challenges like Covid and\\xa0\\nenergy crises, hasn\\'t caused any\\xa0\\xa0 significant damage to the Polish industrial\\xa0\\nsector. This resilience is indeed notable.\" The reasons behind Poland\\'s\\xa0\\nrobust industrial performance\\xa0\\xa0 still perplex many economists, Dvorak admits. Several attribute this growth to favorable\\xa0\\ngovernment policies, while intrinsic\\xa0\\xa0 factors like reduced wages and affordable land\\xa0\\navailability remain significant contributors. Moreover, fortuitous timing\\xa0\\nseems to have also played\\xa0\\xa0 its part in Poland\\'s economic success story. Polands incredible growth About this, a noticeable \"near-shoring\" trend\\xa0\\xa0 is on the rise. Western corporations\\xa0\\nare recalibrating their supply chains,\\xa0\\xa0 shifting them from distant locations\\xa0\\nsuch as China to closer shores. Historically, industry has been deeply integrated\\xa0\\ninto Poland\\'s journey to growth since the nation\\xa0\\xa0 shrugged off the chains of communism.\\xa0\\nWhen the curtain fell on the Soviet Union,\\xa0\\xa0 Poland emerged with an expansive and\\xa0\\nsomewhat dated industrial foundation. Yet, the nation\\'s proficient, technically\\xa0\\ntrained workforce made it a prime hub for\\xa0\\xa0 diverse industries, particularly given the\\xa0\\nadded allure of relatively reduced wages. Data from the German Federal Statistical Office\\xa0\\nin 2021 reflected this disparity, with the\\xa0\\xa0 average hourly wage in Polish manufacturing at\\xa0\\n$12.33 compared to Germany\\'s substantial $49.56. For years, Poland played the role of a\\xa0\\njunior partner in Germany\\'s industrial\\xa0\\xa0 realm. Being an integral part of\\xa0\\nGermany\\'s automotive supply chain,\\xa0\\xa0 Poland has been producing essential\\xa0\\ncomponents like engines, tires, and car seats. Despite this, automotive production\\xa0\\ntoday constitutes approximately\\xa0\\xa0 one-tenth of Poland\\'s total manufacturing output. However, the vision from Warsaw seeks to\\xa0\\nshift gears. Polish leaders aspire for the\\xa0\\xa0 nation to begin producing higher-value items and\\xa0\\xa0 have initiated measures to draw foreign\\xa0\\ninvestment in avant-garde technologies. Noteworthy advancements in this direction include\\xa0\\xa0 Intel\\'s announcement of a $4.6\\xa0\\nbillion factory near Wrocław. Simultaneously, Warsaw has been proactive\\xa0\\nin courting investments from the Taiwan\\xa0\\xa0 Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, aiming to\\xa0\\nmitigate geopolitical risks linked to China. Moreover, Poland has surged ahead in securing\\xa0\\ninvestments for battery \"gigafactories\",\\xa0\\xa0 crucial for the electric vehicle industry. I In 2022, Poland outstripped the\\xa0\\nUS in battery manufacturing,\\xa0\\xa0 with its output surpassing Germany\\'s\\xa0\\nby more than double. However,\\xa0\\xa0 both European nations trail behind\\xa0\\nChina\\'s colossal battery output. A cornerstone of Poland\\'s industrial\\xa0\\nascent is its ambitious infrastructure\\xa0\\xa0 expansion. Between 2011 and 2021, Poland\\xa0\\nconstructed 429 miles of motorways,\\xa0\\xa0 surpassing Germany\\'s 193 miles, though Poland\\'s\\xa0\\nstarting base was considerably smaller. Yet, as Poland\\'s momentum rises,\\xa0\\nGermany faces its set of challenges.\\xa0\\xa0 With the cessation of affordable\\xa0\\nRussian gas, elevated electricity,\\xa0\\xa0 and gas costs are concerning entities\\xa0\\nlike the German Industry Federation. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz\\xa0\\nrecognizes the profound issues,\\xa0\\xa0 extending beyond mere gas pricing. He\\'s\\xa0\\nchampioned the transformation of Germany\\xa0\\xa0 into a renewable energy titan, eyeing\\xa0\\nan 80% shift to green energy by 2030. Nonetheless, experts have raised eyebrows at\\xa0\\nBerlin\\'s policies, particularly their nuclear\\xa0\\xa0 energy stance. Even as Germany races to\\xa0\\naugment clean electricity generation,\\xa0\\xa0 its remaining nuclear power plants\\xa0\\nhave been prematurely shut down. In contrast, Poland, feeling the\\xa0\\ngeopolitical pressure due to its\\xa0\\xa0 proximity to Russia and Ukraine,\\xa0\\nis charting a different course. With coal powering around 70% of its electricity,\\xa0\\xa0 Poland is aggressively venturing into\\xa0\\nrenewables, including inaugurating\\xa0\\xa0 its nuclear power era. Recent developments\\xa0\\ninclude signing a contract with US heavyweight Westinghouse to construct an AP1000 reactor,\\xa0\\nset to be operational by 2033. This initiative,\\xa0\\xa0 along with others like small modular reactors,\\xa0\\xa0 is backed by giants such as Rolls-Royce\\xa0\\nand GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy. Mark Nelson from Radiant Energy views Poland\\'s\\xa0\\nnuclear strategy as a boon for industries,\\xa0\\xa0 offering them a consistent,\\xa0\\ndependable power source. This energy stability can be a significant\\xa0\\nattraction for foreign investors,\\xa0\\xa0 especially when juxtaposed against\\xa0\\nGermany\\'s fluctuating energy landscape. Nelson said, \"With nuclear energy, there\\'s\\xa0\\na promise of consistent, ultra-affordable,\\xa0\\xa0 clean electricity. For industrial entities,\\xa0\\xa0 this assurance paves the way\\xa0\\nfor considerable investments.\" Looking forward both countries Pivoting our focus back to Germany, the\\xa0\\nnation\\'s reservations regarding nuclear\\xa0\\xa0 power have become increasingly evident in\\xa0\\nrecent diplomatic maneuvers. Germany has\\xa0\\xa0 actively lobbied against France\\'s ambitious\\xa0\\nplans to reform EU electricity markets. The proposal from Paris aims to\\xa0\\ncommercialize nuclear power at\\xa0\\xa0 rates that mirror production costs, a\\xa0\\nmove Germany isn\\'t keen on embracing. Berlin\\'s abrupt decision to decommission\\xa0\\nits nuclear power plants had repercussions.\\xa0\\xa0 The nation found itself compelled to\\xa0\\nreignite coal-driven power stations,\\xa0\\xa0 anticipating the energy\\xa0\\ndemands of the upcoming winter. As it stands, Germany\\'s prowess in the\\xa0\\nEuropean Union\\'s industrial sector is\\xa0\\xa0 unmatched, contributing to an impressive 26% of\\xa0\\xa0 the EU\\'s manufacturing output.\\xa0\\nPoland trails with a 6% share. However, this landscape isn\\'t static.\\xa0\\nThe gap between Germany and Poland\\'s\\xa0\\xa0 industrial outputs is gradually diminishing. Dvorak from Oxford Economics articulates\\xa0\\nthe challenge and the path ahead for\\xa0\\xa0 Poland. He observes, \"As nations\\xa0\\nprosper, their wage bills surge,\\xa0\\xa0 affecting their competitive edge.\\xa0\\nThe inevitable trajectory for\\xa0\\xa0 Poland is to ascend the value chain to\\xa0\\nsafeguard its manufacturing foothold.\" This evolving dynamic casts a shadow of\\xa0\\nuncertainty for leaders like Scholz in\\xa0\\xa0 Germany. The strategic distance between\\xa0\\nBerlin and Warsaw, in industrial terms,\\xa0\\xa0 seems to be contracting faster than anticipated. That’s all for today. We\\'ve\\xa0\\nnavigated the ever-changing\\xa0\\xa0 industrial landscapes of Germany and Poland. As Europe\\'s power dynamics shift, questions arise:\\xa0\\nWill Poland\\'s rise influence other EU countries?\\xa0\\xa0 How will Germany\\'s energy policies impact its\\xa0\\nlong-term industrial competitiveness? And,\\xa0\\xa0 crucially, what do these changes mean\\xa0\\nfor the future of European industry?

       " \"Ciao Dzień dobry! welcome back to my Eurovision react review\\nchannel. So this video is delayed not out of trees\\nso I was waiting for all of the 10 songs to be released for to bear said say arrow pay\\nYeah, which is the name of the Polish national final which is taking place this week and\\nwhere the winner will represent Poland at Eurovision so I was waiting I was waiting\\nI was waiting until I saw today that Alesia, Poland's representative at 2020 Eurovision\\nwhich never took place. Her song isn't dropping until midnight tomorrow\\nnight. Well, that's no good for me. Because on Friday, I'm flying to India. And as a result of that, I just can't wait\\nthat long. So elites hear I hope your song is great. But fundamentally, I'm not going to be able\\nto listen to that until basically Sunday, which is when the national finals taking place. So nine songs have now been released. Apologies for my dishwasher. If that's in the background. I'm really sorry. That is annoying, but there's nothing I can\\ndo about it. I'm trying to multitask. I'm trying to pack for India. I'm trying to wash my dishes. I'm trying to do this video. And it's just the way it is. My Polish national flag proud industrial flag\\nby Polish flag is behind me in solidarity with what I hope is a strong national final,\\nif you're new here. Whilst obviously my Polish pronounciation\\nand my Polish in general is bad. And to some extent non existent. I am part Polish hence my invested interest\\nin Poland selection for their song for Eurovision 2023. So with that said, the nine songs what I'm\\ngonna do is I'm gonna check them out. I'm going to do my usual kind of rank them\\nout of 10. Again, there's no kind of if you've watched\\nmy channel before, there's no kind of rubric that I use to work that one out. But nonetheless, by doing that, it allows\\nme to rank them at the end. So I can't necessarily say my 10 to one because\\nI guess it's nine to one, but nonetheless, let's just check them out. Let's see what Poland's gods are for this\\nyear. Okay, so number one, Natasha please don't plagiarism me. So I for my benchmark of female bop numbers, I'm\\ngonna compare compare this to paranoia from last year right, Daria. This isn't as good as that hear the chorus for a second time. Makes me like the chorus a little bit more. It's nothing special. And I think because arcmin set the bar so\\nhigh last year. I think Poland needs to meet that or deliver\\nsomething even better. And this isn't better than river or equally the same. So a bad little pop song. doesn't really go anywhere. Okay, and Natasha writes, okay, so for Natasha, live do up 6.9 to 10 Not a bad start a solid start a\\nsafe start, right? Kuba Kuba is back I'm assuming it's the same\\ncool bar let's see if the song is better than last year. So his song last year got selected for OJ\\nsecond chance right. wasn't a bad number. I liked the duet that he has done with Psara. So let's check out you do me. Okay. This has potential a bit more. cheesier then is offering from last year somewhat sugary, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's catchy. It's all right. Catch here then Natasha is I mean, it's no groundbreaking. It's very kind of safe. I kind of assumed Kuba would come back with\\nsomething a bit more of an impact. Because I know he really wants to do it. I've seen him in an interview where he's made\\nthat very Claire hates his dream, but it's better than\\nNatasha. It's a catchy hoorah. We're treated to kind of two choruses pre\\nchorus of a post chorus the on my way of three courses three part\\ncourse we know the dude can perform I particularly remember that last year stage presence and\\nchoreography was on point do you actually like it? Let's go more positive for this one. Good Bob. I'm gonna give you a 7.9 So I think one on\\nmy left them 7.9 Okay, all right. So number three. Okay. Lena Lena booty now, because of the lyrics, I can't not compare\\nthis to Meghan Trainor write all about that bass. Which is a far more superior song from the\\n40 seconds I'm listening from moody. Our Lena. Not too short. This one. I'm getting the vibe the production is not\\ngoing to shake up. So we're going to get the same beat and the\\nsame tempo. So you just got to go for three minutes. And you either like it the first body socket,\\nseconds seconds, or you get a taxi annually. I'm not a huge fan of these kinds of mid tempo\\nbeats that don't shake up their tempo. Learning what real men want. Thank you Elena. They weren't booed at all right. I don't know if you know this, but that man\\nis all about the booty. Okay, Elena. Yeah, Elena. I'm not convinced I want to get that taxi\\nI want to be out of here. I'm not as good as Natasha is. Let's go in at a six only because I remember\\nthe song. Booty booty Booty booty Booty but I've added\\nso many booties on that self bet. Yeah, not a fan six next K Dominic please\\nbe better than a Lena. high potential already all right. I think this is my favorite so far. In regards to my personal taste, I really\\nlike that. That tempo it sounds a bit like Amy MacDonald\\nand Mr. Rock and roll them in stone rock I like this it's my favorite so far. This is the most authentic songs so far. Right Do you know what Dominic? Thank God for that because I was getting a\\nlittle bit nervous. Chris were on the song before. And I was like I'm a Polsky pry. I feel awkward river would mean that Poland\\nwould turn around and be like we couldn't do this. Because the first three songs weren't completely\\nthat strong. That's a decent effort. That's a decent effort. I'm gonna give that an 8.2 I quite like that\\none is a good one. Got the melody in my head. Always a good sign. Okay, so let's see. I think she's released a snippet as you can\\nsee there tick tock snippet. I can't judge this I'm gonna slip it back\\nat least work out the sort of song that it is the vibe that it is our ballad that gave me nothing. Let's see. I can't comment on that whatsoever. Other than it's a ballad. Good luck on Sunday. But ultimately, as I said, Sunday's gonna\\nbe the first time I listen to that song as how Hopefully I watch the national final live. It is Sunday, isn't it? And pretty sure it's Sunday. Right? Okay. Well, I think this is the next Sunday when\\nwe listen to right for levers. So we've got a rock band. There's a rock song and every National Pie\\nnow. Now, I'm not a huge fan of rock. Surprise, surprise, if you're following my\\nchannel, you'll know that unless there's something about it that draws me in which is rare. And I haven't heard anything yet. That makes me as a non rock listener. Tap in it's the first time I've heard Polish\\nthough. Hala to that 0.5 marks with a bit of Polsky I can tell\\nyou is better than booty I mean, I'd rather it just go completely broke\\nto be honest at this point. This fits all right this part of the songs all right all right. Takes a while to get going. Oh, I've been harsh. This is all right. I should take it back down assistant to the last minute again. So right I can't even remember Natasha is now. I think this is better than Natasha is that\\n6.9 She's right. It does take a while to get going. Never back down. Joe I go as far as what I gave cou Kuba 7.9\\nI'm gonna give for believers. I want to give them a 7.8 Never back down\\ngot much better as it went through the song and actually listened to it last minute again,\\nwas probably a positive thing for me because actually, that song increased probably by\\nnaught point four as a result of listening to the last minute again. That wasn't bad. Actually, that wasn't bad. Okay. Maya, Maya never never hide. never hide. Come on. Maya. You've got this. Is this going to be a bang? Oh, it's Belding come on Maya where she go in Santa Clara lyrics is kind of a bit on the\\nnose and cheesy but nonetheless, there's an uplifting message there. I'm just thinking about the whole kind of\\npackage and I'm kind of taking my mind back to MGP Norway in the sense of a lot of bangers\\nin a national final and a lot of them just not progressing. How would this fare in Norway? I don't know. I don't know I've not completely written this\\none off just yet. This has every potential to be my favorite\\nactually. It definitely does have a sound which I love. Just not sure this is cheese, cheese cheese\\ncheese bubbles bubbles bubbles with extra bubbles bubble gum pop certainly some good elements this I'm just\\nnot sure if it's all coming together or it is quite cheesy this I think if no way southern Norway Poland selected\\nthis. I wouldn't be able to guarantee with qualified\\nbut I can guarantee I'd enjoy it some of these dancers are living their best\\nlives. Everything about this package is cheese cheese\\ncheese are included her family at the end? Is that message to her child. I don't know I'm a bit torn, because it has\\nthe makings and ingredients to produce something that I would absolutely love. But I just don't know. I'm gonna have to put that as a 7.5. I just think something's missing in that one. And also something's doesn't quite come together. I think the thread that holds that three minutes\\nsong at certain parts of that thread has a few knots my end not a bad effort. Not a bad effort. But I think yeah, I think Dominic's is better\\nand actually I probably want to listen to Cooper again before I listen to Maya, right, okay,\\nnext Okay, so we have a young now, which is Polish for John. It doesn't. I know like pretty much most reactors have\\nreacted to this some way. And so watching all of these reactors react\\nto this song and obviously getting mad viewing wasn't the best thing or the easiest thing\\nfor me but ultimately what I try and do in national finals is I try and list them all\\nback to back and you can thank litsea for basically delaying that so I'm finally\\ngetting around to listening to this song. So there was quite a lot of hype about this\\nsong both inside Poland and outside of Poland, I believe, but I haven't watched any of the\\nreaction videos because I can't because I didn't want to listen to the song. So I can only assume that people went crazy\\nfor this song and the reaction videos based on the amount of views that those reaction\\nview videos we're getting. So this is probably the favorite array and\\nI will be honest with you. I'm hoping that for Poland sake I hope this\\nis good because I haven't heard a Eurovision winner yet. And I don't think I've heard a Eurovision\\ntop five either come on then. Gladiator This better be a gladiator good voice this will be a nice evolution dark woods wherever Okay, so it is evident that this is already\\nthe best song that I've heard so far. And what I meant by earlier in regards to\\nthis is a very good evolution of Atkins river is that kind of operatic up operatic backing\\nvocal that we could hear in that chorus then which certainly played a key role in all Cummins\\nchorus in river so yeah, I quite like that that kind of lineage from last year. This is a decent song so far. The videos interesting Yeah, my dad so far this is the one that Poland\\nneeds to pick I am loving the kind of choir backing vocals This is the best song like no other song comes close in regards to competitiveness\\nI like Dominic's but if Poland the thinking obviously for Eurovision and being competitive\\nso far, this is the one I like this musical interlude as well because\\nactually it kind of breaks up which is quite a kind of dark and intense production gives\\nyou a breather which I quite like I like the shake up in this kind of yeah dance beat moment. You just see how he stays is this because\\nit was in a studio last year wasn't it? So I'm assuming it's going to be a studio\\nagain it's not an arena might be an arena I don't know but it was a studio last year how long is the song Yeah, it did fit I thought\\nit was over three minutes so it's going to have to be cut by less this end bit is just\\nperfect. Oh easy Yeah, that's so far hands down the\\nobvious choice for Poland and based on the songs that have been selected so far, that\\nif that gets selected this weekend that will kind of massively shoot Poland up in regards\\nto the bedding odds Poland pick that that puts them easily from the songs that we have\\nso far must be shooting up into the top five and the betting odds from what we have. From what I've heard so far come on Poland. I do think Poland picks the best song Last\\nyear I did like Darius paranoid but no outcome was the clear choice so we know that we can\\ntrust Poland to select the right one. So there are still some still left to go but\\nthat's the obvious one for me. Okay, so now we've got Blanca she's got mad\\nviews so she's got 10 million views. Does that mean that this song is epic? Does this mean that we might actually have\\na competition this weekend yeah I love it already. This has so much potential to be on my playlist\\nright now this is my favorite This is my favorite everything about the song so far. I'm obsessed with I really want Polaroid to pick this word. Now just quickly sorry blanket pause you my\\nworry last year with paranoia because that had been out for so long. had basically people got used to the song\\ndo you see what I mean? Like if you think about all the songs that\\nare like big hits on the radio, you listen to them so many times you kind of get a little bit sick of\\nthem very rarely do listen to a song kind of six or seven months after with that same\\nintensity. I am slightly worried that the song has been\\nout for quite some time I need to check how long gladiators been out for but this has\\nbeen out for over four months. Does that mean that there will be some apathy\\nwith people at home and as a result they're kind of done with this song. I love this song I hope that I love everything about this song I'm downloading this so now I'd like a solo\\neasily my favorite bass Yes. I had Down down down down down down. I was asked to this I will be very upset if prank does not win. But like I said I'm getting the vibe is Gladiator\\nall the way unless something horrifically goes wrong on stage this weekend. Warner Music I suppose got 10 million views. She's got some money behind a big record label. right we've got one more Okay, so we've got\\nJanna with champion last song song number nine so technically tips on 10 This was all right it's quite simplistic. In regards to his melody, the chords but it's not bad. No bad Yan. I think you can thank Blanca Blanca gave me life. I think I'm still riding the Blanca wave. Which Yan is taking advantage of champion James champion champion feel like I've heard\\nthis song before though. If if you're Eurovision freak like me the\\nyear that we chose Michael race, he doesn't 19 the United Kingdom There was a song called\\nfree which is similar s s. This genre or this sound? I've heard a few times obviously re packaged. But it's very familiar. This sound it's been shaken up now hit the note chain is cracked my neck yawn No. I don't know if you are going to be a champion\\nthis weekend. Yeah. I'm a champion. Oh, what? Oh, what? A champion. You're gonna massively benefit Yan by being\\nlast because there are songs that I do not remember. Ie even Cooper's is hazy now. Right? Let's digest woke up. top nine. Okay, so I've worked out my top nine. So in ninth place is Elena with booty yet\\nnot a fan of that song. Number eight is Natasha. I don't really remember that song. And I think because for me, female bops have\\ndelivered in quite high quality in different national finals, particularly Norway. I have them at quite a high bar. And Natasha didn't hit it an audit number\\nseven Maya. I listened to that again earlier to see whether\\nin fact I do love it because it has every potential to be a song that I could totally\\nlove. It's missed the mark for me slightly. Something's missing in that song. And number six, believe it or not believers\\nagain, I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right never back down. That's not a bad song. That's not a bad song, actually, and as if\\nyou watch the reaction, the last minute I watched again and as a result of that, I did\\nkind of appreciate it more. Number five, I say my top five songs that\\nI probably will now add to my national final final playlists Kuba I actually am quite enjoying\\nthe cheese. The cheesy element of Kuba song borrow borrowing\\nelements from the sound of Chaga whereby last year was quite sexy and cool. This one feels a bit more bubblegum pop. Um, number four is Yan champion. Yan with a way that massively benefited by being lost? Because it's in my head. That's not a bad so Oh, good. Number three Dominic, that's quite a good\\nsong. Actually, that's the sort of sound that I\\nlike. In fact, I was listening to Amy MacDonald's\\nfirst album, yesterday. I do like that sound. That's very much the sort of sound that I\\ndo enjoy listening to. And then number two, number one, if you watch\\nmy reaction, it shouldn't be too surprising. Number two is Yan with a J Gladiator. I can see why there's hype around that song\\nand can see why there's excitement about that song. I think potentially out of all the songs that\\nponies got to choose from, that's the one that stands the best chance at competing in\\nLiverpool. And particularly in comparison to the songs\\nthat were already been selected. That might be quite a wise choice. But my number one is Miguel Blanca solo that\\nsong is addictive. within the first days, I guess it was like\\nshade you're gonna love this and then ended up being true that as long as the absolute\\nJude so much so I really want to listen to that\\nword. Now that was my favorite hands down. I'll be honest with you. The gap between number one number two is quite\\nbig. So obviously I was giving it a 10 I didn't\\ngive up like a score at the end 1212 I've said that's the zone for me, but I don't know if\\nthat will be selected this year based on what happened last year with Derya and paranoia. So yeah, good luck on So Sue. Good luck on Sunday Poland. pick wisely I've told you who I want to pick and I will be watching it from the comfort\\nof my seat in India. I will be in New Delhi in Shane in New Delhi. But I will be watching it but I ultimately\\nhad to get this video out of the way today or it just was not going to happen.

       " 'Infiiltrating forbidden territory right under the nose of the authorities. Sometimes, you just have to be bold enough and blend in to get inside the most spectacular abandoned places you can imagine. Disguised as construction crew on a busy working site nobody would ever stop you. But there is also another approach: Reach out to the landlord, be kind and ask for permission to explore the premises. As a result, we were able to visit this stunning decommissioned power plant, unique in the whole country. In our final episode of Poland’s undisclosed landmarks, we head to the colossal remains of grand industry. The exploration of two more powerhouses is the crowning achievement of a remarkable golden autumn adventure. If you enjoy our videos make sure to hit the subscribe button and click the bell to get notified when we upload new content. We finish our road trip series in the heart of Poland. This is Łódź. With more than 700,000 inhabitants it is one of the country’s biggest cities. In only a short amount of time during the 19th Century, Łódź was turned from a minor village to Europe’s most important textile metropolis. Today, the city is a testimony to the time of the industrial revolution. Factories from a bygone era lie idle and appear like post-apocalyptic wastelands. During our day trip to the city, we wanted to explore two of these sites. Let us start with the behemoth of Łódź: A massive abandoned power station that can be seen from many miles away. With its tall chimneys, the two impressive cooling towers and the solid concrete block in the middle of them, the whole premises seem sublime and not decommissioned at all. And yet, the 20-hectare land with several buildings was abandoned five years ago. We were told about security on the compound, and we were not sure about taking the risk. But then we came across two master urbexers who motivated us to venture inside. We tried to find a way onto the premises but getting past the fence was a challenge. Luckily, those two smart boys found a workaround. They were just leaving the property when we arrived. Now, we knew how to get inside. It looked like the demolition of the plant was already well advanced. But the construction machines have been idle for some time, so we hoped that there was still plenty of interesting stuff to explore left behind. Unfortunately, we were already too late to see much of the cooling tower. The catwalk was removed and so, we only could enjoy the view from downstairs. After five years of construction, this thermal power station started operation in 1960. With eight boilers and six turbines, the plant had enough capacity to provide power and hot water for the following centuries. With the growing demand, the site needed to be restructured multiple times. Later, it was decommissioned because of environmental restrictions and the development of the local heating market. In 2012, the plant started to shut down. In 2015, the decommissioning process ended. Come visit the plant today to experience a great scenery for photographers and adventurous people. But it is also dangerous. There are piles of rubble everywhere. It all seems like it could fall apart at any moment. But as long as you mind your step, you can easily enjoy a mind-blowing view you will not find in your everyday life. Just see for yourself! We are a few years late. Before they started demolishing the plant, there was everything left behind and explorers could experience a fully intact but yet abandoned power plant. A Polish explorer provided us with these pictures. He also helped us with some of the locations we wanted to see on our road trip. We highly recommend checking out his website if you are interested in more abandoned places in Poland and all of Europe. Find the link in the video description down below. Unfortunately, security showed up. They were patrolling and we did not want to get caught. So, we decided to leave before they could spot us. Although, we have not seen all of the plant yet. Today, the demolition of the power station is paused. The new property owner wants to turn this industrial wasteland into office buildings and apartments. But wrecking the place is illegal because the historic preservation office did not approve it. So, demolition needed to be stopped. Since then, the new owner makesheavy losses due to these restrictions. This is an attractive property. It has its own railway siding, it is close to the airport and the freeway. The compound is located in a busy area close to the city center. Thousands of people are passing by every day and by now, it became a well-known landmark of the region. If we come back to Łódź one day, there might be barely anything left of it. But until then, the eerie ghost towers overlook the city and point us to the next and final location of our Poland adventure. The main reason why Łódź became a town that big is the former textile industry. Spread all over the city, you can find old cotton mills. For our final exploration, we visit one of them. The remains of the most famous one, the Scheibler factory, are a construction site today. An investment group decided to turn the huge premises into a new and modern city district. During our visit in October 2019, they were in the middle of their latest building phase. Even in the UK where the industrial revolution started, there were only a few factories that big. Poland’s king of cotton was actually a German by the name of Karl Wilhelm Scheibler. He was one of the most important industrialists in all of Łódź. He owned one-seventh of the urban area and his spinning mill was the biggest one in town. Several thousand employees were working here at the end of the 19th century. Still today, the remains of the historical factory seem tremendous. Nature had taken over what people left behind; art was filling spaces once occupied by machines. The whole site was abandoned after the end of the Cold War. For us, this was another exploration with permission. We even got this tour for free! This was a great and actually the only opportunity to explore Poland’s most fascinating abandoned power plant. But since the whole site was a construction area, they were really concerned about us. To be honest, it was a bit odd to get all the safety gear and listen to a 15-minutes long presentation about safety in derelict buildings. We probably entered more ruins than these people. However, prepared like a real construction crew they guided us to the centerpiece of the facility: The historical thermal power station. During our visit, it was completely covered and people were working inside the building. So, we were not sure if we could experience the plant in its full beauty. Luckily, we could. This is a real industrial cathedral. Karol Scheibler, the son of the rich industrialist who built the factory, decided that they needed to be independent of any external supply of energy. So, a modern powerhouse was constructed around 1910. Unfortunately, there is not much left of the control room. However, many of the remarkable details can still be found in the turbine hall, such as the towering windows with their geometrical glass paintings. The walls of the hall are elaborately decorated with yellow art nouveau tiles. The tiles on the floor are checked and also ornamented. The stairs have impressive cast-iron banisters. The ceiling is huge and unique in the whole town. Although this is an industrial plant, it is more splendid than some of the palaces we have seen. Without any interruption, the power plant was operating until 2003. Many parts of the technical equipment were preserved, for example, the oldest turbine of the German company AEG from 1935. We say it in every episode of this series but we are really happy that two urbex photographers joined our Poland adventure. On that road trip, we were mainly focusing on shooting video. We only took a few pictures. That is why it is even more interesting for us to see the abandoned places from our trip through the lenses of our friends. If you want to discover more, visit tobi_urbex and a.nonyme_k.nipser on Instagram. We have added their profiles to our video description. Meanwhile, the derelict plant is part of a big project. On four hectares, several apartment buildings and offices get constructed. The historical buildings of the factory get transformed into restaurants, shops and communal areas. Old and modern architecture will be combined. This process is almost over. Explorers who came after us told that they were too late to see the power plant in its original state. The collapse of the textile industry was hitting the city hard. Many people moved away. Whole streets are grey and deserted today. In all of Łódź, there are relics of the industrial age. But something is happening with the forgotten plants. Art and culture are thriving. New life is breathed into old structures. Old Łódź is dead. But the new one is rising. Abandoned Poland turned out to be a dream destination for urban explorers. The country offers many historical places rich in variety with great stories, unique architecture and secret surprises. While sharing the episodes with you, many locals contacted us and invited us to explore their nation again. During our short road trip, we only covered a fraction of Poland. It is a huge country with many more abandoned places. This means one day, we will definitely come back for a second season of Poland’s undisclosed landmarks.

       " 'The most powerful fighter jet in the world\\nis now arriving in Poland. The 5th generation fighter jets are part of\\nthe 90th Fighter Squadron, part of the U.S Air Force\\'s 3rd Wing at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson,\\nAlaska. They will reach 32nd Tactical Air Base in\\nŁask, Poland, via RAF Lakenheath in England Once deployed, the unit will be referred to\\nas the 90th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron and will be supporting the NATO Air Shielding\\nmission. The NATO Air Shielding mission brings together\\nallied air and surface-based air and missile defense units under NATO’s command and control. the U.S Air Force said in its release, that\\nmission “will provide a near seamless shield from the Baltic to Black Seas, ensuring NATO\\nAllies are better able to safeguard and protect Alliance territory, populations and forces\\nfrom air and missile threat,” In this video Defense Updates analyzes why\\nF-22 Raptor in Poland is the worst nightmare for Russia? Let\\'s get started. Poland is strategically located, sharing long\\nborders with Belarus and Ukraine The country has become a staging ground for\\nforeign arms and other military supplies heading into Ukraine. Poland itself had provided various weapons\\nlike tanks and howitzers. The nation is also taking significant steps\\nto bolster its own defenses that include acquiring Abrams main battle tanks from the U.S as well\\nas howitzers, and aircraft from South Korea. Viewer may note that Russia has recently warned\\nthe West. Konstantin Gavrilov, the head of Russia\\'s\\ndelegation on arms control said in Vienna, \"Increasing supplies of Western weapons to\\nKyiv may force the Russian Federation to take tougher actions,\" F -22 Raptor is an engineering masterpiece\\ndesigned for \"First Look, First Shot, First Kill\" It is the first operational aircraft to combine\\nsuper-cruise and super-maneuverability. Supercruise is the ability to have sustained\\nsupersonic flight without having to use highly inefficient afterburners. With this F-22 can intercept targets which\\nsubsonic aircraft would lack the speed to pursue and an afterburner-dependent aircraft\\nwould lack the fuel to catch. This is possible due to the very powerful\\ndual Pratt & Whitney F119-PW-100 after-burning turbofan engines. F-22 has a speed of Mach 1.82 during super-cruise. The AN/APG-77 radar equipping F-22 features\\na low-observable, active-aperture, electronically scanned array that can track multiple targets\\nunder any weather conditions. It has a range of around 400 km or around\\n250 miles against a 1 m2 target. This radar can also be used for electronic-attack\\nby focussing its signals on the enemy to overload their sensors. The radar changes frequencies more than 1,000\\ntimes per second to resist jamming and has a Low Probability of Intercept meaning enemy\\nradar warning receivers are not able to detect that a radar lock has been achieved against\\nit Raptor is also now equipped with Link 16 through\\nwhich it can connect with military aircraft as well as ships and ground forces exchange\\ntactical pictures in near-real-time. F-22 Raptor is developed from the grounds\\nup to be stealthy. F22 is the stealthiest fighter ever built\\n& has a very low RCS (Radar Cross Section) of only 0.0001 m2. It achieves this due to its structural design\\nas well as the use of Radar Absorbing Materials (RAM). Raptors can’t be detected by most radars. Even if some radars are able to detect it,\\nthey will find it very hard to track it and have a radar lock. Hence, Raptor can strike with its plethora\\nof air to air and air to ground weapons without the enemy knowing it is there in the first\\nplace. Apart from Raptor, Poland’s airspace is\\nnow defended by Poland’s own F-16s and MiG-29s, F-35As flying from Spangdahlem in Germany\\nas well as U.S Marine F/A-18 Hornets from the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing (MAW) are also\\npresent at Łask Air Base It is clear that sending the F-22 Raptor is\\npart of an increased effort by the U.S. and its NATO partners to boost the aerial presence\\nin the region as they face growing rhetoric from Russia. Russia has no operational 5th generation stealth\\njet with the serial production of Su-57 delayed due to technical issues and may not commence\\nbefore 2027. Su-35 which is currently its most potent fighter\\nhas been shot down in Ukraine with not-so-sophisticated systems and hasn\\'t been able to carry out\\nproper SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defense)) missions, clearly demonstrating it has many\\nshortcomings. In this situation, F-22s will provide a massive\\nadvantage to NATO in case Russia initiates any hostile action against Poland. In April when a discussion in relation to\\nimposing of No Fly Zone was going on, US Air Combat Analyst Connor Hall, suggested to theaviationgeekclub.com\\nthat “8-12 Raptors could sanitize the skies over Ukraine within an hour.” Overall it can be stated that the arrival\\nof Raptor in Poland is very bad news for President Putin.',\n",

Folk wisdom is something that\\xa0\\nshapes who we are and describes our mentality.\\xa0\\xa0 Sometimes it\\'s so intertwined in who we are, that we might actually not notice it. I actually started realizing it only when I lived\\xa0abroad and though I spoke English, sometimes my friends had no idea what I was saying.

In English it literally means \"a\\xa0\\nbear\\'s favor\" and it actually means a\\xa0favor, which causes harm to the person it\\xa0\\nwas supposed to help. And this phrase comes\\xa0from a fable, where a bear killed a hermit as he was trying to remove a fly from his forehead. This phrase literally translates to \"split the\\xa0bear\\'s skin\" and it means to get prematurely\\xa0excited about something that we don\\'t know for\\xa0\\ncertain will actually happen, and it implies that\\xa0we should not depend on something,\\xa0 until we are\\xa0\\nsure that it will actually take place. I\\'m pretty sure that this phrase comes from\\xa0hunting, when the hunters would go on a hunt and they would fight over who gets the bear\\'s\\xa0fur before they even found the bear. And I believe that the English equivalent for that\\xa0phrase is \"to count the chickens before they\\'re hatched\". This phrase literally translates\\xa0\\nto \"the turkey was thinking of Sunday\". And the meaning of this phrase is actually very\\xa0similar to the one about a bear, the previous one about splitting the bear\\'s skin. And if\\xa0you\\'re Polish you probably know the second\\xa0part of this phrase, which is usually just\\xa0\\nimplied and the whole thing goes like this: And it translates to: \"the\\xa0\\nturkey was making plans for Sunday, but on Saturday his head was\\xa0\\ncut off\". And I think it\\'s pretty much self-explanatory. It literally translates to: \"where there is two\\xa0Poles, there will be three opinions\". And I did speak about this phrase in one of my previous\\xa0videos and you should see a link somewhere around there and I will also put a link to it\\xa0in the description box.  so if you want, check it\\xa0\\xa0out after watching this one.  But just to sum it up,\\xa0\\nwe Poles are very opinionated. We tend to have a\\xa0strong opinion on pretty much anything. And I think\\xa0partially it\\'s related to knowledge because none\\xa0of us want to think of themselves as ignorant.\\xa0 And you cannot have an opinion on something\\xa0if you don\\'t know anything about it. It does get quite tricky during debates and discussions,\\xa0 when two opposing sides realize that they\\'re getting\\xa0closer and closer to a common conclusion. Suddenly they start to shift with their argument to end up in discussion  and not agreeing with\\xa0their opponent. Because for many it\\'s a point\\xa0\\nof honor to have a different opinion from their opponent. And on that note\\xa0let\\'s go to the next phrase. which literally translates to: \"where two fight,\\xa0the third one profits\".  I think there is a an\\xa0English equivalent to this phrase,  which goes\\xa0like \"two dogs strive for a bone the third one\\xa0runs away  with it.\" And I think this phrase\\xa0is applicable pretty much anywhere in the world. And now a typical self-deprecating Polish phrase, which literally translates to: \"a Pole is wiser\\xa0after the damage has been done\". and I think this\\xa0phrase might have originated from history,\\xa0\\nwhen whenever Poland was in danger people would always fight what it is that should\\xa0be done. There were two Poles, there would\\xa0be three opinions. And only after the damage\\xa0has been done, everyone knew what it was, that should have been been done to begin with. But I think this phrase applies to pretty much every mundane daily thing, daily\\xa0events and pretty much anywhere in the world. There is a phrase\\xa0that has been ringing in my head for\\xa0quite some time now, until I\\'ve decided to\\xa0start a vlog about Poland.\\xa0 For many years I\\'ve wanted to travel the world, make videos about what I see, what I experience. But this particular phrase\\xa0kept coming back in my head. And it is as follows: And it literally translates\\xa0to: \"you praise the foreign you don\\'t\\xa0know your own.\" So I\\'ve decided to prove this\\xa0phrase wrong and start a vlog about my own country. The last phrase I wanted to share with you guys is one of my personal favorites. And I don\\'t\\xa0know if it\\'s the image that it brings to\\xa0my head, or if it\\'s the meaning behind\\xa0it. But I think it is a good phrase to ponder. And it literally translates to: \"the word\\xa0\\nhas been spoken, the mare is at the fence.\"\\xa0 And it means that no matter the circumstances, a person\\xa0\\nshould stick to what they\\'ve promised. And there is an interesting anecdote related to this phrase\\xa0\\nthat explains the origins of the story and the meaning behind it. so the story goes like this:\\xa0 Back in the 18th century, a nobleman from the\\xa0city of Łuków - Jakub Zaleski decided to travel to\\xa0Warsaw to meet with the King John III Sobieski\\xa0 to negotiate inheriting the lands and the office of\\xa0the mayor after his deceased brother. He traveled by horseback, because that was the way to travel at\\xa0\\nthe time. While he got to the castle,\\xa0\\xa0 they told him that the king is out hunting. So he\\xa0went to the forest searching for the king, could not find him. He ran into another nobleman and told\\xa0his story. The nobleman that he ran into asked him,\\xa0\\xa0 - what would you do if the king did not grant your\\xa0request? And Zaleski, very full of himself, said:\\xa0\"then I will tell him to kiss my mare\\'s ass!\"  Well unsuccessful in his search, Zaleski went back to the\\xa0castle, where he found out that the king\\xa0was already there and could meet with him. Zaleski went to meet the king and realized that the\\xa0nobleman he spoke in the forest with,  was actually the king - John III Sobieski. So John III Sobieski asked\\xa0his subject - what would you do if I did not grant\\xa0you that request? And scared out of his wits, but\\xa0\\ncould not go back on his word, Zaleski looked at\\xa0him shakily, and said: \"well, the word has been spoken\\xa0the mare is at the fence\". The King was so\\xa0amused with this bold answer and Zaleski\\'s bravery, that he decided to grant him all his requests. Well, what can I say, sometimes it\\xa0\\npays off to be bold and stick to our word, even in the most unfavorable circumstances.\\xa0 That\\'s it from me. Write in the comments if\\xa0there is any other Polish phrases, that\\xa0you would like me to explore. And see you soon!',\n",
       " 'Today in the video I\\'ll tell you what I miss from Germany. There will also be a Christmas competition. You can find out how you can take part and what you can win later in the video. So be sure to watch the video until the end. And right after the intro it starts. At this point again. Hello and welcome to my YouTube channel. Maybe I\\'ll introduce myself briefly for people who don\\'t know me yet. My name is Christoph and I emigrated from Germany to Poland about 4 years ago. My channel is all about Poland. I mostly talk about the differences between Germany and Poland, and I also show a travel report here and there when I\\'ve been on holiday somewhere in Poland. And yes, political topics are not left out here either. My goal is perhaps to bring the country of Poland a little closer. Also do a bit of educational work. And maybe you can round it all off a bit and say create a connection between Germany and Poland, or connect people to each other to simply clear up misunderstandings. If you like these topics or are just looking for a bit of entertainment, I would really be happy if you subscribe to the channel and activate the bell immediately. You can do that down here by clicking on my logo down here. This would really give you total support for me and my work . Thank you very much for that. Now let\\'s get to the main topic and talk about the Christmas competition. But I think what\\'s much more important is let\\'s talk about the things that I really miss from Germany. As just mentioned, I lived in Germany until almost 4 years ago. That means I was born in Germany. I spent my childhood and youth there. I also experienced everything growing up in Germany . And I also got to know my first impressions of life and my first experiences in Germany. Accordingly, of course, there are things that I miss here in Poland. The first point I would like to address is friends and family: Personal contact with friends and family is now very sporadic. You might meet at special events. Or I, for example, sometimes meet my parents on summer vacation when we meet somewhere on the Baltic Sea, for example. Then I drive from Poland to the Baltic Sea. Then from Germany to the Baltic Sea. Sometimes we spend a week or two together where we can really hold each other and maybe sit together and just talk about God and the world in the restaurant. Contact with friends and family is primarily based on a digital level. This means that you mostly send each other voice messages. Or even make a video phone so that you can see each other from time to time. But there is still no personal contact. I met a lot of nice people here in Poland. But of course you can\\'t compare this to a lifelong friendship or even family. The second point I\\'m addressing here is probably not for everyone. But it\\'s German football. As some people know, I was born in Dortmund. For me personally, Dortmund is the number 1 football capital. In my opinion, football has a little bit of a different significance in Dortmund than in perhaps smaller cities where football is perhaps not that popular. Back then, we always took the opportunity to meet up together on weekends or on match days. That means friends and family. Maybe even have a barbecue together and then watch the game. It wasn\\'t uncommon for us to go to the stadium ourselves to look at the players. It was all connected to a meeting. At the very beginning when I came to Poland I also bought a football subscription through viaplay. I think it cost me around 35 zloty back then. So I was able to do that too still follow the German Bundesliga and the German Cup. Nowadays my priorities have changed a bit. I really don\\'t follow every Bundesliga game anymore. I\\'ve already canceled Viapay and, for example, the last World Cup, and that never happened before. I didn\\'t watch a single game. My priorities have simply changed. I now also have a wife and child. There is also the YouTube channel which takes up a lot of time. And instead of watching football on the weekend, for example. I\\'d rather spend time with my family or work on my YouTube channel. There are also products and foods here that I rarely or never get here. So we now come to the third point. These are foods and products. Personally, I have a favorite shower gel that I have been using for several years. This is this shower gel from the CD company: CD products are available here in Poland. You can get CD creams, hand creams, body lotion here, you can also get deodorant rollers or other things here. But I have never seen shower gel like this here in Poland . At least not in the usual chain stores. I haven\\'t seen a CD shower in German retail chains like Rossmann either . Where I \\'ve seen a CD shower gel before . But there was also very, very, very little choice. Was here in these typical \"German shops\", which are really limited to cleaning products, care products and possibly sweets. But to also mention a price difference here. For example, a bottle of shower gel costs around €1.75 in Germany. And here in Poland it costs the equivalent of around €2.50 to €3. But I don\\'t just have problems with shower gel. Anyone who regularly watches my videos probably knows that I also really , really, really like eating mustard. There is a type of mustard here that I can\\'t get at all in Poland. And that is “lion mustard”. I haven\\'t seen \"lion\\'s mustard\" anywhere here before. Not even in German stores or anywhere else. So these are always products. Something like the lion mustard or the CD shower gel, which I always have sent to me regularly from Germany. That means I always get a package from my parents 2 or 3 times a year. And they always throw a lot of products at me. Which I can\\'t get here. So also CD shower gel or lion mustard, among other things. What I also have to mention in passing is that Polish baked goods are really delicious. But I haven\\'t seen one here yet . At least not in this form. This is “bee sting”. I\\'ve never had a good bee sting here in Poland. So I always take the opportunity when I\\'m in Germany to treat myself to a piece of Bee Sting. Let\\'s stay on the topic of bakers and jump from there straight to the fourth point. One thing that I really miss here in Poland and that I really miss is that there is no bakery open on Sundays where I can buy fresh bread or fresh rolls. For me it was a given in Germany to go to the bakery every Sunday and just get fresh bread rolls. So that you can enjoy it in peace at home. I really miss that here in Poland. There are cafes here that are also open. Which offer a wide range of breakfasts. You can get something like scrambled eggs, fried eggs, bagels. With sausages, English breakfast. So that\\'s really not missing here. A bakery that is open on Sundays where you just want to buy your fresh bread rolls. I\\'m just missing that here. In the tourist area everything looks a little different. My experience has been that in most tourist areas there is a bakery open here and there somewhere. Who then also offers fresh rolls or fresh bread. I can also remember a personal story. Where I wanted to go to the bakery on Sunday for the first time. I was at home with my wife. I got dressed and she asked me where I wanted to go. And I have Of course, he said very casually, \"yes, I\\'m going to the bakery to get some bread.\" And then she said: “But which bakery is open?” and I looked at her and said: \"I guess every bakery here is open.\" And she said: \"No, the bakery isn\\'t open here.\" Then I asked my wife, puzzled: \"But then where do people buy her Bread and buns?\" Then she said to me: \"They buy it on Saturday.\" And that was just something that I found very, very, very strange to me, that people have to buy their bread and rolls on Saturday in order to be able to eat it on Sunday. But I have already found the ideal solution to this topic. I just buy a few more rolls a few days before, freeze them and then take them out for breakfast on Sundays. If necessary, I\\'ll put them in the oven again to thaw. Then I have almost like fresh rolls from the bakery. But now let\\'s come to the fifth point. And the fifth point will probably surprise some people a little. But what I\\'m missing a bit here is the German language. But when I talk about the German language, I don\\'t mean hearing the German language. I\\'m actually more interested in conversing in German. For me personally, it makes a difference to be in your native language with someone you\\'ve known for 20-30 years. Here\\'s perhaps a small approach to point number 1. Or when you\\'re talking to someone you \\'ve known for maybe 2, 3, possibly 4 years in a language you\\'ve learned. Or in a language that you have learned. I\\'ve already mentioned in one or two videos that my Polish is around C1 level. That means I can speak fairly fluently. I rarely have problems. But it has to be said very clearly that my vocabulary in German is much broader and larger. I also have the feeling that the cultural difference also has a small influence on it. And that\\'s not meant to be bad or negative in any way. I just sometimes have the feeling that Poles are not always open to talking about every topic. Now if we just take the topic of politics as an example. And I know. Politics is a very critical topic. You have to be really careful, but people here are still very secretive. Even people you know a little don\\'t like to talk about politics here. They also say that they don\\'t want to talk about politics so much simply to avoid arguments. But it\\'s similar here on TV. For example, if we now have five politicians at a table and the moderator too. Then you can really hear five politicians and the moderator speaking at the same time. Maybe it\\'s just something I personally have a little problem with. Here\\'s a question for the other emigrants. To the German emigrants. What language do you use in everyday life? Here in Poland, for example, I really only use Polish 90% of the time. I speak Polish with my wife and I speak Polish with my colleagues. I only use the German language when I record a video. When I talk to friends and acquaintances on the phone. Or when I talk to my daughter. I also speak German with her, but she doesn\\'t answer me yet because she\\'s still too small. But just to show. I actually use the Polish language 90% of the time here. And maybe that\\'s just the thing where I say, okay, I miss the German language a little bit. Before we get to the sixth and final point , as promised, I would also like to talk about the Christmas competition. And you can win a game. A “Monopoly Łódź” game. This is probably a special edition for the 600th anniversary of Łódź. Łódź recently celebrated its 600th anniversary. They released a special edition. The game has been on the market for a few weeks now, I think . I think it came out on October 28th or something like that. This is also completely newly welded, everything closed. You can definitely win this. Maybe I\\'ll pack a few more too Polish treat in the box. I would rather give the game as a gift. But since I do it on YouTube I have to do it in a competition. That\\'s why I\\'m now forced to mention the competition conditions here. Otherwise I will have problems with YouTube. So it\\'s a competition and anyone in the world who is at least 18 years old can take part in the competition. I also cover 100% of the shipping. For example, if you come from outside the European Union where there may be problems with customs. You have to pay for customs duties yourself. However, I will cover 100% shipping. Legal recourse is also excluded and anyone can participate if they leave in the comments. #Competition writes. I came up with it this way simply so that I can be sure that I only draw people who really want to take part in the competition. The draw will then take place via the YouTube random picker. This will all take place on December 10th. So on December 10th when the video was published. Somewhere in the video I will simply draw the winner. After that we have to get in touch somehow. Depending on email, Instagram or whatever. Let\\'s see then. Then I\\'ll definitely send you the game. Maybe with a few Polish specialties. So you \\'ll most likely get the game for Christmas before December 24th. That\\'s it for the competition. Let\\'s come to the sixth and last point of the things I miss from Germany. The sixth point has a little more to do with the geographical location. Where I lived before. As I just mentioned, I am a native of Dortmund. So I was actually very close to Holland and Belgium. I actually went to Holland or Belgium very often. Just to go on a day trip or just to spend a long weekend. I think everyone who comes from this region of Dortmund and the surrounding area probably knows how to go over to Venlo to see \"2 Brothers\" or go to the weekly market in Enschede. Or maybe even spend a long weekend in Amsterdam. These were my 6 things that I miss from Germany . At least the ones that are worth mentioning. Which of these things would you also miss? Or maybe there are other things you would miss? Please leave it to me in the comments and don\\'t forget to write #competitors so that you can also take part in the Christmas raffle. With that in mind, I really thank you for watching this video to the end. With this you really support me and my work. Thank you very much for that. Stay healthy and see you next time. Ciao',\n",

out walking their dogs\\xa0\\xa0 welcome back to the channel guys and welcome to\\xa0\\nbeautiful krakow poland today we are going to be\\xa0\\xa0 exploring the royal wawel castle and the jewish\\xa0\\nquarter of Kazimierz so join us on this quick\\xa0\\xa0 adventure around the beautiful city of krakow\\xa0\\nthere's plenty of history in poland and we can't\\xa0\\xa0 wait to check it out let's go our first stop\\xa0\\ntoday before even entering Wawel castle is the\\xa0\\xa0 Wawel dragon or smok Wawelski he is a mythical\\xa0\\ncreature of polish folklore and he apparently was\\xa0\\xa0 bothering the people of krakow in the 13th century\\xa0\\nand in order to please this dragon they were\\xa0\\xa0 throwing cattle at him for a while from inside\\xa0\\nthe castle but the the son of the king apparently\\xa0\\xa0 figured out how to kill this creature by filling a\\xa0\\ncow with sulfur and throwing it at the dragon and\\xa0\\xa0 then the dragon died so the statue of the dragon\\xa0\\nsmok just outside the royal castle of Wawel it\\xa0\\xa0 breeds fire every five minutes and there's always\\xa0\\npeople around it so make sure that you get here\\xa0\\xa0 relatively early to be able to get up nice close\\xa0\\nand personal with the dragon as it's breeding fire\\xa0\\xa0 it is a true spectacle it's probably great\\xa0\\nactually to come here at night because you'll\\xa0\\xa0 really be able to see that flame look at this\\xa0\\nlittle cute dragon i want it so bad little smok\\xa0\\xa0 as with every tourist attraction\\xa0\\nyou are going to find people selling\\xa0\\xa0 souvenirs and naomi really wants one\\xa0\\nof those smok dragons gib a dragon\\xa0\\xa0 beautiful setting of this castle just facing down\\xa0\\non the vistula river and we can't wait to go in\\xa0\\xa0 now and check around the grounds it's apparently\\xa0\\nfree to check a walk around Wawel grounds if you\\xa0\\xa0 want an actual tour guide you do need to book in\\xa0\\nadvance two weeks if anybody else have that issue\\xa0\\xa0 that when you see souvenirs you kind of want to\\xa0\\nbuy it you know exactly you're never going to use\\xa0\\xa0 those souvenirs even if i was to buy one of these\\xa0\\ndragons i would probably look at it for a while\\xa0\\xa0 and then it would just die off somewhere in the\\xa0\\ncorner or something same with me like everywhere\\xa0\\xa0 we go so far since we started traveling you go\\xa0\\nto all these destinations you see the souvenirs\\xa0\\xa0 and then you're just like i want this but then\\xa0\\nall it does is add weight to your suitcase yeah\\xa0\\xa0 that's the one thing i would love to buy souvenirs\\xa0\\neverywhere but we just have one backpack each so apparently this was one of the very\\xa0\\nfirst unesco world heritage sites that's\\xa0\\xa0 really interesting all of\\xa0\\nthe travel that we've done\\xa0\\xa0 over the last year through europe and mexico\\xa0\\nand places like that we saw a lot of unesco\\xa0\\xa0 world heritage sites but this is one of the\\xa0\\nvery first ones so wow excited to be here all of the gardens that are surrounding Wawel\\xa0\\ncastle and the whole exterior around here that\\xa0\\xa0 faces down onto the vistula river it's absolutely\\xa0\\nstunning we were blessed today with beautiful\\xa0\\xa0 sunshine the sky is clear and we are very\\xa0\\nvery happy to be exploring around here today\\xa0\\xa0 we're going to be walking around here\\xa0\\njust kind of taking in the views thankfully\\xa0\\xa0 you can explore around here for free but as i\\xa0said if you do want to go in and explore the rooms\\xa0\\xa0 itself of the castle you do have to book well\\xa0\\nin advance because it is one of the most popular\\xa0\\xa0 castles in all of poland it's really astonishing\\xa0\\nto see how much work was put into this castle\\xa0\\xa0 the majority of it was built in the 13th\\xa0\\nand 14th century but every single thing here\\xa0\\xa0 every house everything is still standing\\xa0\\nso it's not like it's a castle that is just\\xa0\\xa0 lying in ruins somewhere just kind of\\xa0\\nneglected this castle actually is beautiful\\xa0\\xa0 and everything is still there and you can\\xa0\\nreally imagine what it might have looked like\\xa0\\xa0 in the 13th and 14th century you can really see\\xa0\\nthe level of wealth that the people that occupy\\xa0\\xa0 this castle had there is a lot of gold on this\\xa0\\nbuilding that i'm currently standing in front of\\xa0\\xa0 one of the roofs actually just looks to be\\xa0\\nentirely made out of gold so very interesting\\xa0\\xa0 and it's so gold it's interesting to note like\\xa0\\njust the level of work that went into architecture\\xa0\\xa0 back in the day nowadays it's super\\xa0\\nstraightforward you have like little red\\xa0\\xa0 bricks that they just cement and pile up together\\xa0\\nbut back here in the 13 14 15 16th century\\xa0\\xa0 a lot more detail a lot more work a lot more\\xa0\\nbeautiful we wandered around the castle and\\xa0\\xa0 found this absolutely amazing courtyard here\\xa0\\nand the entry to the castle or to the castle\\xa0\\xa0 yard itself is completely for free but obviously\\xa0\\nthere are some areas where you would have to pay\\xa0\\xa0 i think to go inside the dragon's den where the\\xa0\\nsmok Wawel used to live you would have to pay\\xa0\\xa0 and also for the museum parts you would have\\xa0\\nto pay but the general area here is for free\\xa0\\xa0 one recommendation for you guys if you ever choose\\xa0\\nto come here to Wawel castle is definitely to\\xa0\\xa0 show up very early in the morning because it does\\xa0\\nget quite crowded i think we got here around\\xa0\\xa0 10 30 maybe 11 o'clock and it's literally\\xa0\\nlike filled with school classes which is\\xa0\\xa0 beautiful to see because a lot of these children\\xa0\\nobviously learn about their own heritage and\\xa0\\xa0 about their own history but at the same time\\xa0\\nit gets very crowded so make sure to be here\\xa0\\xa0 early well check this out guys it looks\\xa0\\nlike they're actually growing grapes here\\xa0\\xa0 in the yard of the castle and i'm wondering\\xa0\\nif they sell like a special edition type of\\xa0\\xa0 wawel castle wine or something like\\xa0\\nthat that would be absolutely amazing\\xa0\\xa0 the guys Wawel castle is getting a little\\xa0\\nbit crowded right now there is literally\\xa0\\xa0 every 30 seconds hundreds of kids and tourists\\xa0\\nmaking their way in to the ground so we're going\\xa0\\xa0 to try now and make our way towards Kazimierz\\xa0\\nor the jewish quarter check that place out and\\xa0\\xa0 show you guys some of the best cafes that we've\\xa0\\nfound while wandering through Kazimierz let's go so first impressions Wawel castle what\\xa0\\ndo you think Wawel castle is absolutely\\xa0\\xa0 stunning and it's a very unique place because like\\xa0\\ndifferent architectures kind of clash together\\xa0\\xa0 from the different centuries and you can really\\xa0\\nsee like i feel when you look around you can\\xa0\\xa0 see different centuries in different parts of the\\xa0\\ncastle itself which i think is absolutely stunning\\xa0\\xa0 i 100% agree with naomi if you do want to get\\xa0\\nsome spectacular views over krakow as well\\xa0\\xa0 definitely make sure to head up to Wawel castle\\xa0\\nit's entirely free to wander around on the grounds\\xa0\\xa0 but if you do you can book a ticket as well\\xa0\\nif you do want to do that um two weeks in\\xa0\\xa0 advance is kind of the go-to but there's plenty of\\xa0\\ntourists wandering around there so definitely go\\xa0\\xa0 and check it out check out smok the dragon as\\xa0\\nwell the fire-breathing dragon that's really\\xa0\\xa0 cool we would suggest you guys to come in the\\xa0\\nevening after sunset if you get the chance\\xa0\\xa0 because i'm sure you would be able to\\xa0\\ntake some stunning pictures of that dragon\\xa0\\xa0 so guys just to let you know we are currently on\\xa0\\nthe quest to reach 5 000 subscribers so if you do\\xa0\\xa0 like our videos and you like who we are\\xa0\\ngo and hit that juicy red subscribe button\\xa0\\xa0 and help us out thanks guys we just saw someone\\xa0\\nout walking their sheep i'm used to seeing people\\xa0\\xa0 out walking their dogs but walking a sheep i was\\xa0\\npretty special and there was a guy dressed up as\\xa0\\xa0 smok the dragon as well i think that sheep was\\xa0\\njust thinking to himself why am i here why is\\xa0\\xa0 there a guy dressed as a dragon and can i eat your\\xa0\\ncostume can i eat your costume so we're making our\\xa0\\xa0 way now into the jewish quarter of Kazimierz\\xa0\\nand it just runs parallel to Wawel castle\\xa0\\xa0 so if you are looking to imitate this little\\xa0\\nday of exploring like we're doing right now\\xa0\\xa0 all you got to do is head behind Wawel castle\\xa0\\nor go parallel with it and you'll find your way our first stop here in Kazimierz today is this\\xa0\\nbeautiful alleyway where parts of schindler's list\\xa0\\xa0 were filmed even though this part of\\xa0\\nthe city has never been a jewish ghetto\\xa0\\xa0 during the occupation of nazi germany the jewish\\xa0\\npeople were relocated to another area of the city\\xa0\\xa0 and this area before the second world war\\xa0\\nwas kind of a mix of jewish and catholic\\xa0\\xa0 people as far as we understood but parts of\\xa0\\nschindler's list were filmed here in this area we need a quick refreshment so\\xa0\\nlet's go in here in a local cafe i ordered a lemonade but it kind of\\xa0\\nlooks like a spinach nade let's try it's actually really nice very\\xa0\\nthick you can taste the acidic\\xa0\\xa0 part of the lemon but it's also very\\xa0\\nminty so it's not spinach is mint this area of krakow nowadays anyway is considered\\xa0\\nmore of like the trendy alternative type of part\\xa0\\xa0 of the town where all sorts of\\xa0\\npeople like artsy type of people\\xa0\\xa0 come together you find loads of nice little cafes\\xa0\\nloads of vegan places a lot of falafel places\\xa0\\xa0 all of these types of things here there's a lot\\xa0\\nof shops as well where you can kind of buy crafty\\xa0\\xa0 type of things like artisanal goods and handmade\\xa0\\nthings which is really really nice but be warned\\xa0\\xa0 with these these types of areas obviously\\xa0\\nthat are considered a little bit more hipster\\xa0\\xa0 the prices go up as well and i think we just\\xa0\\nwhat did we pay for the coffee and the lemonade yeah we just got like a super basic i got a\\xa0\\nlatte and naomi went for a lemonade and yeah\\xa0\\xa0 for that same latte and lemonade in even in\\xa0\\nthe center of krakow we would have paid around\\xa0\\xa0 30 percent less than what we just paid the latte\\xa0\\nthat i got was nearly four euro and the lemonade\\xa0\\xa0 that naomi got i think was around 3.50 and if you\\xa0\\ngo even to the center square of krakow you'll\\xa0\\xa0 probably find places where you can pay half\\xa0\\nof that so be warned if you're in the jewish\\xa0\\xa0 district or the jewish quarter the prices go up\\xa0\\nbut you do have beautiful surroundings like this\\xa0\\xa0 obviously in the city center you will find places\\xa0\\nlike starbucks or costa coffee as well where it's\\xa0\\xa0 going to be the same amount of money but this area\\xa0\\nis just a little bit more hipster and alternative\\xa0\\xa0 which you see all over europe really that\\xa0\\ntype of movement and prices go up with that\\xa0\\xa0 gentrification what would it two what would a\\xa0\\ntwo mad explorer video be without a little bit of\\xa0\\xa0 food in it right four tacos with beef so we were\\xa0\\nactually on the hunt for some Zapiekanka cheese\\xa0\\xa0 and jalapeno but on the way to the market square\\xa0\\nwhere we wanted to get the Zapiekankas we actually\\xa0\\xa0 found this little mampf yard sriracha is perfect\\xa0\\nso a food court so to speak and we found a little\\xa0\\xa0 mexican stand called companeros we just ordered\\xa0\\nsome tacos there hardshell tacos i'm looking\\xa0\\xa0 forward to eating this because we're both really\\xa0\\nhungry okay guys so here we are eating mexican\\xa0\\xa0 food in the jewish quarter of the south of poland\\xa0\\nin krakow super excited to try these tacos out\\xa0\\xa0 they're hard shell tacos and we just or i\\xa0\\ndecided to just go for spicy on top of more spicy\\xa0\\xa0 because i like spice and we got sriracha sauce\\xa0\\nwe got jalapenos they're layered with cheese and\\xa0\\xa0 i think they have like kind of a chili or spicy\\xa0\\nlittle nacho or dorito in there so cin cin guys holy sh oh my god that's very spicy yeah that has a kick to it\\xa0\\nthis is gonna blow my face off i can't even i can't even talk it's too\\xa0\\nspicy very tasty but very fresh ingredients\\xa0\\xa0 but very spicy my face i can see it it's\\xa0\\ngoing red this is gonna blow my face off\\xa0\\xa0 if luke is dying i don't know what is going to\\xa0\\nhappen to me this is gonna blow my face off  i'm gonna try and grab the\\xa0\\njalapeno and put it aside if you can hear somebody breathing heavily\\xa0\\nluke is currently dying behind the camera so\\xa0\\xa0 this is going to blow my face off it's\\xa0\\ngiving me a lot of hope for my future actually not that spicy it's\\xa0\\ngood but like it's very tasty\\xa0\\xa0 but it's not as spicy as i thought it would be\\xa0\\xa0 that little food court that we just stopped at\\xa0\\nwas amazing they had plenty of different types of\\xa0\\xa0 fusion type food so they had a mexican food stand\\xa0\\nthey had beer they had japanese food they had a\\xa0\\xa0 bunch of stuff they even had polish food there as\\xa0\\nwell so now we're going to make our way towards\\xa0\\xa0 Wolnica square which is supposedly the main square\\xa0\\nto check out in the Kazimierz district if i would\\xa0\\xa0 live somewhere close to this food court\\xa0\\ni swear to god i would be severely obese friends of ours were saying that they\\xa0\\nhad their best ever Zapiekanka in poland\\xa0\\xa0 here in this exact square somewhere so we're\\xa0\\nstill looking for the local Zapiekanka dealer\\xa0\\xa0 we're not too sure where we can find it to be\\xa0\\nhonest i see a lot of sushi places kebap places\\xa0\\xa0 ice cream places bakeries but no Zapiekanka where's the Zapiekanka actually funnily\\xa0\\xa0 enough since we came to krakow we've been\\xa0\\nlooking for Zapiekanka i know a few places\\xa0\\xa0 that sell it in the main square area of krakow \\nold town but since we came here to kazimierz\\xa0\\xa0 can't really find any Zapiekanka so we're just\\xa0\\nlooking we're on the hunt for a Zapiekanka to wrap\\xa0\\xa0 up today's video hopefully we come across it soon\\xa0\\nafter the Zapiekanka disappointment we decided to\\xa0\\xa0 go with ice cream instead seemed easier absolutely\\xa0\\nyeah we came across a place called papa gelato and\\xa0\\xa0 you can't really go wrong with a name like that\\xa0\\nso i decided to go for the cream with pistachio\\xa0\\xa0 in a chocolate cone i can't wait to\\xa0\\ntry this and i got a cream and apricot\\xa0\\xa0 yeah it's like seems to be naomi's go-to flavor\\xa0\\nshe loves yogurt and she loves apricot as well so\\xa0\\xa0 we are gonna give this a shot see\\xa0\\nwhat it tastes like i'll go first wow that's very creamy for a cream flavored\\xa0\\nice cream and i'll give pistachio a go pistachio tastes like pistachio it's really\\xa0\\nreally good ice cream very creamy ice cream\\xa0\\xa0 and yeah it wasn't really that\\xa0\\nexpensive either we're right here\\xa0\\xa0 in the Wolnica square or plaza so what a\\xa0\\nperfect place to come and enjoy an ice cream\\xa0\\xa0 in this beautiful weather here\\xa0\\nin kazimierz smooth transition\\xa0\\xa0 how insightful to say that the pistachio\\xa0\\nice cream tastes like pistachio ice cream oh this is good i'm not really of an ice\\xa0\\ncream type of person but this one here is\\xa0\\xa0 yes so guys that's it from us today we are the\\xa0\\ntwo mad explorers and this is your reminder to\\xa0\\xa0 keep exploring so guys we'll catch you in the\\xa0\\nnext video we are headed to a totally

       " \"Welcome to UnHerd, I'm Aris\\nRoussinos. Along the EU's eastern border, from Scandinavia\\nin the north, to Romania and Bulgaria in the south, troops\\nand jets and warships are being hurriedly deployed to shore up\\nthe continent's defences. On the border with Ukraine in western\\nRussia and Belarus, a great Russian army is massing. The\\nborder between eastern Poland and Belarus already witnessed\\nthe first unarmed skirmish of this new confrontation, when\\nthousands of migrants were sent to breach the Polish border at\\nthe end of last year. I wanted to find out what the atmosphere\\nwas like on this new eastern front. UnHerd was invited by the\\nPolish army and border guard to enter the secure zone and take a\\nlook for ourselves. On the EU's eastern border,\\nmigrants aren't just a humanitarian challenge. They're\\nalso an effective weapon to be deployed at a level just short\\nof open war. When Poland's government gave its full backing\\nto Belarus's opposition after last year's contested election\\nand crackdown on pro-democracy activists, Belarus's strongman\\nand Putin ally, Alexander Lukashenko, funnelled thousands\\nof mostly Iraqi-Kurdish economic migrants to the Polish border,\\nencouraging them to force their way through. The result was a\\nmajor crisis for Poland and a watershed moment for EU\\nmigration policy. Militarised migrant pushbacks, once taboo,\\nwere now praised by EU leaders. Back in September when the\\nborder crisis began, the Polish government forbade access to\\ninternational press and NGOs, turning the border with Belarus\\ninto a closed military zone. Now they've begun taking press on\\nvery tightly restricted media tours of the border zone, and\\nUnHerd has been invited on one of the very first trips. Please. Follow me. Is the border guard - is that\\nunder Ministry of Defence, or...? No. We are like the police in\\nthe Ministry of Interior. This fence, which you can see, is\\nstanding directly on the border line. Please stop here. Stop here – ok. What is the\\nsituation now on the border? We are currently at the Kuźnica\\nborder crossing. The situation is under control at the moment.\\nNevertheless, there is a risk that migrants may try to enter\\nthe European Union illegally at Do you see this as a form of\\nhybrid warfare from the any moment. Belarusian side? Definitely yes. It is definitely\\nan example of a hybrid war because all the activities of\\nthe migrants were controlled and inspired by the Belarusian side. What was it like when it when it\\nwas happening here? a kilometre from here. During\\nthe next week, more groups arrived until about 3,500 people\\nwere there. On November 15, Belarusian services sent these\\npeople to the border crossing. The situation was very dangerous\\nas stones, bottles and parts of the fence were thrown at us.\\nMany soldiers, policemen and border guards suffered and were\\ninjured in these clashes. Thanks to the cooperation with the\\npolice and the army, we were able to repel this attack. Do you think it's over now? Is\\nthat it? Do you think the Belarusians will stop doing\\nthis, has Poland won? In Bremino’s logistics centre,\\nthere are still several hundred people who are directed to the\\nsouth of the border where attacks are taking place.\\nHowever, we must be aware that such an attack may occur. The attack on the border led the\\nPolish army to deploy en masse, erecting a new military camp\\nright up against the frontier fence. Our camp is split in two parts.\\nHere is a smaller part, where we keep our vehicles. And we have a\\nmedical section here, and some containers for living. Here you have an example of how\\nthe local people support us, especially in this case,\\nchildren from the local schools. For example, here on this\\npicture you can see 'thank you for the Polish soldiers for\\nprotecting the Polish border, and we wish you a fast coming\\nback home'. So it must be good for morale. Yes, for sure. If you see that\\nsomeone supports you, someone brings you food, and sends you\\nsuch beautiful letters, it is always very good for morale. So, how was the situation seen\\nin Poland, as a national emergency on the border? Yes, in Poland it's a\\nmainstream, right now, topic. Everyone discusses this. A lot\\nof people support services, police, border guards and\\nsoldiers, in their hard work. This is a hard time right now. With soldiers, drones, and\\nthermal cameras, the Polish state has turned this bleak\\nstretch of eastern forest into a bastion of Fortress Europe, with\\nthe European Union's blessing. So, in all the footage that was\\nseen around the world, of a big camp of migrants trying to break\\nthrough into Poland, that was right here? Yes, this was where the whole\\nemergency started. This is also where the first attack took\\nplace, an attempt to cross the border by force. The camp\\nstretched from one hill to the other. In one week, 1,500 people\\nbecame 3,000. After a week, all these people moved toward the\\nborder crossing and there were further attacks. This isn't just Poland's border,\\nit's the border of the European Union as well. Do you see your\\nrole here as defending Europe as well? Yes, from the very beginning,\\nwhen we entered the European Union, we are aware that we do\\nnot protect only Polish borders but also the borders of the\\nEuropean Union. This border is its external border, and we are\\nresponsible for it as well. It's your job to defend the\\nborder, but we all saw the footage of migrants lighting\\nfires here out in the rain, in the cold. On a human level, when\\nyou saw them close up, did you feel sympathy, or did you feel\\nsorry for them? Of course, seeing such pictures\\na person must feel something. But we must protect the borders\\nbecause if we did not do that, then these dramas could be more.\\nTo compare, in the Mediterranean stretch, many more people pass\\nby. Here, because we operate in this way, we protect the\\nborders, we stop the influx of illegal migration. Back in 2015 when Hungary's\\nleader Viktor Orban erected a wire fence like this to stop\\nrefugees entering the European Union, EU leaders were united in\\ncondemnation. 'The EU should be building bridges, not walls',\\nthey said at the time. But now, a few years later, EU leaders\\nare united in their support for Poland's efforts here, sending\\nbarbed wire, sending border guards, there's even a small\\ndetachment of Royal Engineers here to help the Poles erect\\nthese border defences. The Europe of 2015 already seems\\nlike a vanished world. Hello. Hello. Good boy. All along the border, police\\ncheckpoints have been set up to search passing traffic for\\nhidden migrants. Ninety miles south of Kuźnica, another\\nstretch of barbed wire is now the most active section of the\\nborder, where migrants still attempt to break through every\\nday. Monitored by Belarusian border guards across a closed\\ncrossing, I asked the Polish spokeswoman about the situation. Can you explained where we are,\\nand can you tell me about the situation where we are. We are on the section protected\\nby the Polish border guards in Czeremsza. This is where the\\ngreatest number of incidents by illegal immigrants took place.\\nThey were groups of several dozen people who threw stones\\nand pieces of wood at us, and additionally tried to cut the\\nbarbed wire which allowed them to break through to the Polish\\nside. When you see the migrants on the\\nother side of this wire in the cold – it's bitterly cold here –\\nhow do you feel when you see Seeing immigrants on the other\\nside, I fear every time. They them? behave aggressively, carry out\\norders from the Belarusian side, I fear. I do not know what will\\nhappen, stones and various objects are thrown, you are\\nafraid for your own life and colleagues who are next to you. Have you seen evidence of the\\nBelarusian security forces trying to help the migrants\\nbreak through, trying to break the border defences? Almost every time there is an\\nattempt to cross the border by the Belarusian side, they are\\nseen wearing Belarusian uniforms. These people cut\\nbarbed wire and throw stones at us and blind us with light and\\nlaser beams. Yes, yes, Belarusian soldiers are seen\\neach time. Migrants intercepted here are\\nescorted back to Belarus by Polish soldiers – a pushback\\npolicy criticised by human rights groups as a breach of\\ninternational law. If you cross the border you will\\nbe met with our strong reaction. What happens when migrants do\\nbreak through and are intercepted? What happens then? When those people who cross the\\nborder are detained red-handed, later they are led to the border\\nline and returned to Belarus. Some people who want to apply\\nfor international protection stay in Poland then. They are\\ntaken to our facility in Polowce where they are identified and\\nthen transferred to guarded centers for foreigners where\\nthey await decisions. From the Baltic all the way down\\nto the Aegean, the walls are going up across the European\\nUnion's eastern borders, and I doubt we'll see them coming down\\nagain in our lifetimes. With the threat of climate change and\\nstate collapse across the Middle East and Africa, this\\nmilitarised frontier here in eastern Poland represents a\\nvision of our continent's future.\",\n",

IT IS EXPLORING OTHER WAYS TO GIVE UKRAINE MORE MILITARY SUPPORT. THIS MORNING. THAT INCLUDES SENDING FIGHTER JETS TO POLAND. ALEX CAPRARIELLO EXPLAINS HOW THIS POSSIBLE 3 WAY DEAL WOULD WORK ALEX. GOOD MORNING TO YOU. ZELENSKY VIDEO CONFERENCE WITH AROUND 300 MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESS OVER THE WEEKEND DESPERATELY URGING THEM TO SEND MORE FIGHTER JETS TO THE UKRAINE. IT'S AN OPTION THAT'S NOW BEING SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED BUT REQUIRES OVERCOMING SEVERAL LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES. WE WE'RE LOOKING ACTIVELY NOW AT THE QUESTION OF AIRPLANES THAT POLAND. THEY PROVIDE TO UKRAINE AND LOOKING AT HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO BACKSHALL. SHOULD PULL INTO SIGHT TO PRODUCE TO ROB OF SUPPLY THOSE PLAYS. A WHITE HOUSE SPOKESPERSON SAYS DISCUSSIONS ARE UNDERWAY WITH NATO ALLIES TO DECIDE OF POLAND SHOULD SUPPLY UKRAINE WITH SOVIET ERA. FIGHTER JETS. THE TALKS COME DAYS AFTER UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT ZELENSKY PLEADED WITH US. SENATORS FOR MORE LETHAL MILITARY AID AS THEY CONTINUE TO FIGHT OFF RUSSIAN INVASIONS. IN A LETTER TO PRESIDENT BIDEN. SENATORS ROB PORTMAN OF OHIO AND NEW HAMPSHIRE'S JEANNE SHAHEEN URGED THE WHITE HOUSE TO EXPEDITE THE TRANSFER OF AMERICAN-MADE F 6 TEENS TO POLAND. SHOULD IT GIVE IT SOVIET ERA MIX TO UKRAINE TO HOLD RUSSIA'S INVASION IN ADDITION TO STRINGER, ANTIAIRCRAFT MISSILES AND OTHER MILITARY HARDWARE. THE U.S. HAS ALREADY SENT UKRAINE 240 MILLION DOLLARS OF THE 350 IN ASSISTANCE. BIDEN APPROVED IN FEBRUARY. ALSO A BILLION DOLLARS IN SECURITY ASSISTANCE TO THE COUNTRY DURING THE PAST YEAR. THAT'S ON TOP OF THE APPROXIMATELY 12,000 US SOLDIERS DEPLOYED TO EUROPE TO STAND BY NATO ALLIES. SOME ADDED CHALLENGES TO THIS PLANE TRANSFER A PRODUCTION BACKLOG MEANS THAT POLAND WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE ACCEPTING AN IOU FROM THE UNITED STATES.

       " \"today guys we are going to be\\ntalking about the differences between Poland and USA in relation to family\\nwhich i think is one of the most interesting topics really because I\\ndon't think you ever discuss that before mhm\\nyeah so my background is I'm American and I've been to Poland like four times\\nnow now I've been to the States a couple of times too so it's actually nice\\nbecause they also have this perspective an American family as a Polish person yes\\nvice versa with me yeah so these are the two people who have a perspective on\\nboth so I guess we can share our input which will definitely enrich this video\\nand its content so yeah we basically said you know where we're from but I\\nwant to add a disclaimer which is that like you know this isn't 100% true for\\nevery Polish family and every American family said before all hate comments\\ncome in before the backlash yeah before the backlash entirely just know that\\nthis is just from our perspective and we are sharing our own view so it's\\nbasically very subjective okay so one thing that I noticed going to Poland\\na couple times now is that Poland seems to be more family oriented in like every\\nway possible everyone seems closer everyone seems\\nlike they're hanging out more I mean when you see a Polish family it's like\\nwe celebrate every single possible event together\\nbirthdays name days Christmas Easter every every event in fact in your life\\nwhich you consider to be very important we just make use of every opportunity to\\ncelebrate together no matter what is that mm-hmm might be even you know the\\nday of the dog and we're all gathered to celebrate yeah in the US it seems like\\nwe're a lot more work oriented here and that like kind of I hate to say this but\\nI feel like families honestly puts second compared to work in so many\\ndifferent cases and I mean this is just throughout like my friends my family and\\nall that basically Americans are more focused in their jobs and like making\\nmoney I mean the pursuit of money pursuit\\nhappiness all that stuff yeah happiness this a good word\\nbecause I mean you work your ass off till you're like 60 or 70 and then you\\nretire you have plenty of money but do you actually feel like you did something\\ncool in your life except for working right I know because you know side note\\nno one's gonna even say man I wish I would have worked more when they're\\nabout to die you know and I have a feeling whenever you visited my family\\nmy home for the first time I actually felt you were kind of surprised or\\nshocked that everyone is like so yeah welcoming indeed yeah they started\\ntreating him like you know his own family member I'm so shocked every time\\nI am shocked honestly yeah like my mom very often she has tears in her eyes\\nwhen she sees you I mean it's just it's amazing I don't get that with my own\\nfamily so I mean I even had like some family members kind of like not really\\nshow a whole lot of support for my relationship with my girlfriend\\nbasically do you just were not happy with him spending money on tickets to go\\nto Poland instead they wanted me to just go to school focus on school and then\\njust work okay so we're basically just rambling on with points but for the next\\npoint we're just gonna talk about marriage okay so I was looking at\\nstatistics for both Poland and us in regards to divorce rates and what I\\nfound was that the u.s. is around 50% and this is going down just because the\\nMillennials are actually not even getting married right now\\nbut with that being said Poland's divorce rate is around 30% so it's much\\nlower compared to the u.s. yeah I mean in the u.s. if you think about it it's\\nevery second marriage that gets divorced yeah Wow and okay I mean I get it why\\nit's kind of lower in Poland because whenever you actually decide to marry\\nsomeone this is a lifetime decision and also I think a lot of Polish couples\\nhave this mentality off not easily breaking up if something you know is not\\nreally working out well for you but they try to fix the thing\\nwhich I mean this is like teachings of our grandparents for the most part\\nbecause you know this this is something my grandmother was always telling me\\nfirst tried to fix something and if that is not really working then make\\ndecisions and personally speaking my parents are divorced and actually I\\nthink like all of my friends parents have issues or our divorce or separated\\nor there's just something going on so like literally all of my friends have\\ndivorced parents or some type of issue in regards to that so that's just\\nanother thing I noticed in that like in Poland seems like everyone's family is\\nlike super tight yeah think about that now I'm trying to think about some\\nexamples from for example my parents generation like their friends or\\nneighbors who know I don't I'm not able to give you an example of you know couple\\nthat got divorce okay so in the u.s. it seems like when you're kind of younger\\nlike in your mid teens and especially when you turn 16 like right as you start\\nto drive you're kind of pushed into working and also pushed into leaving the\\nhome by like 18 so this is really common and it's almost socially taboo actually\\nto stay in the house past 18 with your parents that's just kind of like our\\nsociety and our culture here like you're supposed to move out when you're 18 and\\nyou know go live you know go live and we don't care about your future anymore\\nyeah you know a lot of parents are pushing for you know the kids to leave\\nby 18 typically wow that's shocking I actually remember whenever you told me\\nthe first time we were talking you were like oh I actually have a lot of jobs on\\nmy resume and I was like wow and you were just twenty at that point to you\\nknow I was like wow you know I never met a person that age that would be working\\nso many jobs and there in the past like I think I started working like 14 yeah\\nfarm since then no one I resistant in Poland yeah I mean people usually start\\nworking like you know some easy jobs like under the table I can I would say\\nhigh school in college you know I would say like 50%\\nof my friends were working but the other ones were like you know just waiting to\\nfinish you know University and it's it I mean that here like the thing is like right\\nas you graduate you have to have some type of experience usually on your\\nresume it's like at least something or else you're not even gonna get a job\\neven if you have the degree yeah and I mean going back to whatever you said\\nthat at the very beginning in Poland I feel like parents did not only want to\\nkick you out of the house as soon as possible okay so I feel like if you see\\nif you meet a person like a kid moving out of their parents house at the age of\\n18 or more it's just because they wanted to do so on their own okay so another\\nexample I wanted to mention is a very common stereotype in Poland which is\\nlike the subject of so many jokes and all that stuff liking those skits mmm and\\nstand-ups and all of that so basically the relationship relation I would probably\\nshould say between the husband and his wife's mother are you with me? I'm with you so usually\\nthere is some type of tension between the two mother-in-law is usually making\\nsome comments above the husband husband is trying to kind of talk back\\nthis is so weird to me like I didn't know this this is not a thing the states\\nat least and I've never heard of it actually I really like your mom. Silvia, I love you. I'm\\npretty sure she's gonna be happy to hear that but yeah I mean I know this like on\\non the example of my family then I mean not always the relation between like\\nmother-in-law and the husband sorry dad is like you know perfect and I\\nmean this is very common across Poland if you ask people that's why we have so\\nmany jokes and stereotypes about that crazy\\nI'll never understand that to be honest okay in the last point we wanted to\\nbriefly touch upon is the thing it's hard to actually articulate that in one\\nlike sentence or one expression but basically whenever you think about a\\nfamily a Polish family most of its members are living in one city or town\\nregion I mean very close to each other when you think about American family\\nstates are so huge that you can actually pick whichever state you want to live in\\nand I have family even like out in Canada and I mean these distances are\\nhuge you cannot go and visit somebody like an hour or two like we can in Poland\\nright guys so that's actually all we have for these concepts and if you have\\nany more that you wanted to talk about or you want to share then let me know in\\nthe comment section down below and as always\\nthank you for watching, see you later\",\n",

       " \"a long long time ago there were three legendary Brothers called black check Andrews The Three Brothers went on a hunting trip together and stalked different animals in different directions black went North check went West and Bruce went to the east The Three Brothers founded their own countries in the places that they ended up you see where this is going right different countries tell different versions of the story but Czech started the check people and ended up as the Czech Republic Bruce started to roost people and ended up as Russia and Mike was according to Legend the founder of Poland they say he founded Poland here after witnessing the Glorious Sunset and white eagles flying around the Polish flag today represents this very Sunset alright I know what you're thinking what the hell happened to the name lack lack started the like I'd say indeed Poland used to be called lechia because of this in early European history the Roman civilization was the embodiment of Christianity and Christianity meant civilization to be formally introduced as a player in European history pretty much meant that your country adopted Christianity if not well we're a barbarian that deserves some crusading around the time that the title emperor of West Rome passed on to the Germanic people and the Holy Roman Empire was established the tribes east of the Empire and the lechia region were still uncivilized because they believed in different religions one of those tribes the fools became the Catalyst for government systems with the chief of the polls miyazeko the first officially being baptized in 966 A.D Poland makes its first appearance into European history as the duchy of Poland alas it's going to go through several cycles of deletion and creation over the next centuries let's set sail for Poland the tragic country ha ha ha the duchy of Poland was officially recognized as a member of the European World unfortunately it was forced to immediately play tower defense against the feudal Lords from the Holy Roman Empire meanwhile they tenaciously conquered territory up to the Baltic coast and the Kiev regions building the foundations for a country finally bullshaw the first the brave son of miesgo the first elevated this humble duchy to a proper Kingdom it even started to spread Catholicism to the Infidel natives in the baltics unfortunately the princes went all Game of Thrones on each other and split the country up among themselves into humble duchies once again divided Poland lost control of the Baltic Sea and was forced back Inland wielding the age-old casis belly of we're saving your soul by forcing you to adopt Christianity you know what's coming the Crusades the Catholic Knights flocked here most of them being Germans from the Holy Roman Empire they built up fortresses here evicted the natives and claimed this land for themselves what else would Jesus do the Polish Dukes were unable to come together you see one of them the Duke of a region called masovia up big time he officially requested the help of the Teutonic order to exterminate the Baltic natives in their front yard sure the Teutonic order gladly crusaded the well hell out of these native infidels but then they just squatted here and created a new Crusade country with the livionian brothers of the sword the Polish Dukes didn't dare to speak up in case they pissed off the Pope after all the Crusade country is claiming to squat here and spread the holy word of God for all eternity and it would be heresy to disagree with this right they had no choice but to just let this German country pop up in the north I hope you're getting bad vibes already Holland finally got their together in the 13th century settling their differences and uniting if you watch this channel the 13th century should give you very bad vibes here comes the unprecedented day of judgment the Mongol Stampede in 1206 the Mongol Empire eviscerated Central Asia and pressed the attack to invade the roost tribes the proud give duchy was trampled into the ground the traumatized survivors fleeing into the kingdom of Hungary and the end of the world by the hands of the Demonic Horsemen was imminent the Mongol forces finally arrived at the Carpathian Mountains in 1241 and you bet that Poland Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire were pissing their pants in absolute Terror the Mongolian Army wanted to stabilize its flank before properly invading Hungary well that meant that Poland was  the capital Krakow was overrun instantly and Warsaw also died soon after the Mongols invaded deep all the way into the Celestia region before the Polish duchies finally understood the severity of their situation their entire civilization could literally be deleted here time to fight everybody knew that Poland was just the beginning Hungary and even the Teutonic order put aside their puny differences and sent reinforcements in legnesia Celestia the desperate last stand for survival against the Mongol hordes ignited but the Mongols were just too strong over ten thousand soldiers were snapped out of existence along with the Duke of Celestia Henrik II there was nothing left to unite over the Mongolian horde thankfully went away on their own because of their own internal conflicts without directly ruling Poland but this wasn't the end of their struggles by any means the Mongols kept sending wave after wave of Invaders and the opportunistic Teutonic order backstabbed and attacked once more now that the imminent Mongol threat was over it was pretty much Anarchy the local nobility Warlords greedily extracted every pound of Flesh from their peasants while Celestia was annexed by Bohemia a unified pool and was completely out of the question until the Mongols finally  off for good in 1287 and 1333 Casimir III the greats Rose to the throne United The Divided duchies crippled the power of the nobility Warlords and enacted several revolutionary policies to rebuild his country from the rubble [Music] there was a good reason why Casimir III the great was called the great he was an absolute b-set diplomacy he conquered Galicia a part of the Fallen King of duchy and donated the Celestia region to Bohemia as a practical Diplomat I mean Bohemia was going to take it regardless so might as well Salvage the cookie points right the real problem was the backstabbing of the Teutonic order Casimir buddy buddies up with the grand duchy of Lithuania to make them think twice before they pull some chicanery you see the grand duchy of Lithuania was a country founded by Baltic Natives and they didn't believe in any of that Christianity nonsense yet the Teutonic order was moralizing and shoving them around for being infidels and so the enemy of my enemy is my friend do you see how difficult of a situation Poland is in right now they have to keep up the appearance of being devout Catholics to stay in the favor of the Holy Roman Empire before they send in another Crusade but their best friend is also a staunch Infidel Poland takes the man masterful Middle Road and sends in missionaries to Lithuania to make a half-assed attempt to spread the holy Gospel of God meanwhile Poland also donates half of the recently conquered Galicia region to not antagonize the infidels alas no King rules forever and the stability he built died with Casimir III the great kasmir had no son the next in line to rule Poland was his niece called yadwiga yeah yadwiga was female which was a big No-No at the time but most importantly she was only 12 years old Poland just barely climbed out of the best of the recycling bin but it looked like they were about to get banished into territory yet again in this time of great crisis Lithuania pulls the ultimate bro move and repays its debt by becoming the knight in shining armor you see they're both scared shitless of the Teutonic order and it's Dreadful Purge infidel's move Lithuania suggests to just merge kingdoms Holland accepts on the condition that Lithuania officially converts to Catholicism Lithuania says whatever and in 1386 the Grand Duke of Lithuania ugalia marries Queen yadwika Poland teamed up with Lithuania now stronger than ever and decides to finally kick the out of the cancerous Teutonic order once and for all on July 15th the 1410 they throw everything they have to get out under the thumb of these religious scourges in an epic showdown at the Battle of grenwald the Teutonic order was finally defeated the moment of Glory for Poland is finally approaching this is what all its struggles were for the Polish Lithuanian Alliance recruited other Christian nations to hold the line against the growing threat of the Ottoman Empire they also ironically forged an alliance with the Mongolian golden horde to give Russia a satisfying kick in the nuts Poland was the new sheriff in town and of course they took this opportunity to grief the neighboring Noob countries just because they could with this newfound power you know that they just had to act on their centuries of resentment against the Teutonic order Poland punched them so hard that the Teutonic order got annexed into Poland Russia is obviously now in 2022 a country that doesn't easily turn the other cheek you should check out our video on the history of Russia to fully understand why Russia is so aggressive a monstrously resentful Russia attacked Lithuania in 1487 and Lithuania was about to just completely die by the mid-1500s Poland and Lithuania decided to completely merge governments in 1569 with the Union of Loveland and to stay alive born again as the mighty polish Lithuanian Commonwealth they were the rising superpower in east Europe their primary military strength came from the Ukrainian Cossacks and the Baltic hussar Horsemen the era of the horsemen is here this polish light Cavalry Army is the famous winged hustler in the Polish terrain mostly made up of flat Plains the deadly winged Husser soared around like their namesake even ravishing the ottoman-controlled Crimean Peninsula and russian-controlled Moscow like a dragon the winged Hustler's Unstoppable charge empowered the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth as the Godfather of east Europe alas times were a changing the modern era was coming up and it's time for Poland to Fall From Grace yet again the newer neighboring countries were centralizing and establishing better systems of government Poland a country whose nobility always had a concertingly strong influence over Central Command was unable to adapt to The Changing Times and established a stronger centralized government they completely missed out on the chance to modernize their politics economy and Military the events of gunpowder meant that the winged hussar started to get shot out of the sky more and more and the antiplated system of serfdom meant that the still medieval bullets produced less stuff compared to other countries the Teutonic order don't forget about them evolved into the duchy of Prussia and was just waiting for the opportunity to declare independence and get out finally in the mid 1600s Poland starts its inevitable downhill trajectory yet again you see the Ukrainian Cossacks rebelled against the Polish nobilities oppression and excessive taxation Russia still grinding attacks that never forgets couldn't resist but to take this cheap shot to make matters worse even Sweden invaded from the north the double-edged sword of the Polish planes oh so convenient when Poland had an Unstoppable light Cavalry also meant that Poland had no way to defend itself when hit the fan and everybody turned hostile thank you because enemies were pouring in from every single Direction polish history refers to this period of time as the Deluge or giant flood polish strategic strongholds were all overrun and even the one subdued tectonic order now Prussia successfully went rogue and declared independence the proud polish Lithuanian Commonwealth that was on top of the world was now forced back into its tiny box of an anxious brittle Nation the Polish military was well very sad about this whole situation it was ganged up on by Prussia Austria Russia and the Ottoman Empire and pretty much died treated only as a pitiful buffer zone the neighboring countries were more than happy to make Poland eat all the collateral damage in the mid-1700s Russia punched the lights out of Sweden and ripped away the Baltic Sea Russia was now also winning the slugfest against the Ottoman Empire cheerfully gobbling up the Balkans things look really dire right now in east Europe and it's clear that Austria is next is really starting to panic coincidentally an anti-russian Revolt erupted in Poland and Prussia enacts this Masterwork of diplomacy to Feast on their sorrow Prussia tells Russia all right look here you might as well just invade Poland because of this incident and Russia loves that idea Austria will also chip in and Rob Poland of the Southern regions while Prussia would just claim some leftover territory in 1772 this deal was executed and all three countries flooded in to invade Poland instantaneously this is the first partition of Poland Poland's Capital was already overrun so Poland had no choice but to just let it happen the foolish Lithuanian Commonwealth feel it in their bones that their entire existence is about to get deleted they swallow their pride and desperately broke her in Alliance with their local devil Prussia to try to stop the Russian Advance they realized their mistake now the nobility had too much power retroactively trying to unfuck themselves government policies limiting the power of nobility were hastily enacted how do you think the nobility reacted to this yep they just switched sides and actively helped the Russians plunder Poland their untrusty Ally Prussia of course sat back and watched as Poland went up in flames in 1793 Prussia and Russia suddenly decided that they were cool after all and divvy up Poland yet again this unfortunate incident is the second partition of Poland whatever reform Poland attempted went out the window Poland was barely hanging on to the small territory it was allowed to have left Poland sees that the end is near Brave polish insurgents unwilling to accept this doomed fate rise up in Rebellion but they just made matters worse you see they just served the Hostile neighboring Nations a bulletproof justification for war on a silver platter Prussia Russia and Austria gleefully answer this cast spellian invade Poland splitting the remaining territory among themselves in 1795 Poland was completely deleted from the world map this is the third and last partition of Poland because you know there was no more Poland left for partitioning Napoleon made his earth-shattering rise in 1806 and blasted Poland's worst enemies Prussia Austria and Russia into a coma the polls now literally country-less try to assist Napoleon and fight towards independence by seizing this moment and revolting as insurgents Prussia retreated from Poland in 1807. Austria followed suit in 1809 and Poland finally won its independence again as the duchy of Warsaw the pools vitriolically joined Napoleon in his invasion against Russia hoping to return some of the pain well you know how this goes their Invasion dragged on until winter the Russian gold killed just about everyone and Napoleon got exiled the Congress of Vienna a meeting meant to discuss how do we France also decided to delete the duchy of Warsaw again out of spite in 1815 not even a decade after hard-earned Independence the partition of the duchy of Poland was enacted and Poland just ceased to exist for the next hundred years a century later in 1914 World War One started and the whole region of Poland became a brutal bloody Battleground for German and Russian soldiers the Polish conscripts caught up in the middle were tragically forced to kill their own fellow poles in a war that they had nothing to do with with Germany's surrender in 1918 Poland finally won Independence yet again after 123 years you know what happens next right Hitler of Nazi Germany wanted to attack France and Stalin of the Soviet Union wanted to not have a war with Germany again the two countries came to the compromise of let's invade Poland together as a term for their non-aggression pact in 1939 Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union invaded Poland and Unison and Poland was deleted from existence yet again in the aftermath of World War II the Soviet Union forced Poland to adopt communism born again as the Polish People's Republic Poland spent most of the remainder of the 20th century as a satellite country for the Soviet Union 21st century Poland a war-torn country with a history of casually being erased from existence is determined to not let that happen again they understandably don't take any half measures with their military spending Poland is now a proud country of the first world and preparing against Russian aggression almost as if they know what it's like to lose a country multiple times as of October of 2022 Poland is one of Ukraine's biggest supporters in its war against Russia not only have they welcomed millions of Ukrainian refugees they're doing everything possible to supply Ukraine with weapons and Logistics it so desperately needs after all as far as Poland is concerned they're next after Ukraine and they would much rather not have a war on polish territory again even going as far to supply a staggering 1 1.7 billion dollars worth of military equipment way out of proportion considering Poland's GDP Poland is gritting its teeth and antagonizing Russia by supplying Ukraine with everything they need to fight a war what about the other side of the story why is Russia making us anxious about a literal nuclear apocalypse check out our video on the history of Russia to learn about the historical and geographical context behind Russia's actions Beyond a convenient hand wavy Putin is evil this has been your captain David Bradford from knowledge Raiders and please share this video with friends if you liked it\",\n",

       " \"on the onset of Hitler's infamous politically campaign Poland bore the brunt and wrath of the entire German army despite a heroic an honorable defense Paulin had no chance of summing the seemingly never-ending tides of German manpower flooding their land and to make things even worse the British their primary allies at the time were too stunned to react at the time of Hitler's invasion in September of 1939 the Polish Navy consisted of four destroyers five submarines one mine layer and six mine sweepers as well as several other smaller and older auxilary boats with their base being located in an awkward position at Gdynia in the Gulf of donks as well as the Germans possessing a vastly superior Navy and Air Force a reluctant order was given to send around half of the Polish Navy to England for preservation including three destroyers this left an extremely small force to defend the home waters of Poland and in short order they were obliterated by the German bombers like five orphans however the submarines called vulture Wildcat Lynx wolf and Eagle had escaped their naval basic dinya after they'd been captured and were cast into a hostile world entirely on their own although still armed with torpedoes and the will to fight the protracted war the submarines were expecting never arrived due to the lack of naval activity in the baltic region the urge to fight was quickly replaced with the urge to survive and one by one they were each confronted with a final moment of truth in a 14-day period between September 11th and September the 25th two of the five submarines of vulture and Lynx were badly damaged and forced to limp to neutral Sweden and another one the Wildcat was forced to give up the fight and surrender as Warsaw had fallen the two submarines left floating in the depths of the baltic sea had no clue of the fate of the other submarines nor of poland's status sensing the end was near one of the submarines the wolf made the decision early to abandon the Baltic Sea and plot a course for England where they could link up with the free Polish Navy there the last submarine active the Eagle had perhaps the most interesting story of all after spending days avoiding German Luftwaffe patrols and German traps the Sun to lure them into revealing themselves their communications with the naval base academia was completely halted on the 12th of September on this same day the entire hydraulic system of the submarines collapsed and the commander of the submarine suffered a near-fatal illness now the votes executive officer lieutenant jeger sinski took over the home and took the submarine to the supposedly neutral Estonia for emergency repairs to place the commander in hospital under international law the palsy expected they would be allowed to remain in port and make repairs for a grace period of 24 hours although the Estonians are first appeared to agree with this sentiment when the Polish crew finished repairs long before the 24 hours expired the Estonians suddenly made them wait six hours for a German freighter to clear the water expecting to follow the freighter out the Estonians hit them with another surprise and under a new declaration they weren't allowed to leave and their ship was to be disassembled of anything that could be used as an instrument of war although the Estonians removed navigational instruments charts and vital components of the boats deck guns they had to wait till the next day to take away everything else including the torpedoes this left the poles with the whole night to conspire and they plotted their escape during the next day they sneakily sabotage it and observe the further dismantling of their ship until the next day they finally made something of their prior work snuck back on and took two armed guards as prisoners aboard the submarine with no harm done to either one although the submarine was now defunct of navigational equipments and charts the officers got together and draw up a homemade set of charts based on each man's best recollection they then also salvaged their radio where they heard of their country's sad fate their first port of call was to sail to neutral Sweden to drop off the two Estonians and lifeboats however the Polish men of the Eagle had no intention of being interned there and instead made the extremely dangerous and arduous journey to friendly England after navigating with the submarine with no navigational instruments through the dangerfoot Baltic and North Sea by mid-october the submarine miraculously made it to England where it could be restored to fight Germany once more and fight Germany it did becoming the first allied sub to sink a German ship taking part in the invasion of Norway Lieutenant Commander grazinsky was posthumously awarded Poland's highest military honour for his remarkable feat in guiding the sub to safety despite extremely unfavorable circumstances the eagle itself continued to fight well into the time of Hitler's invasion of France and the Low Countries until it was never heard from again and the entire crew was presumed lost by the Polish Navy in exile so guys that was just a little story on the Polish Navy and I hope enjoy that as I think the Navy are probably the more obscure part of World War two and least discuss part anyway so I'm glad to be covering them and I hope that you're glad to watch them as well and also guys if you're enjoying our content please do check out the patreon it really helps out anyways as always thank you for watching and I hope you learned something new

       " \"me so guys finally the restrictions uh have been\\xa0\\nlifted up in poland and we are allowed to go\\xa0\\xa0 to parks malls and we are allowed to go out but\\xa0\\nobviously it's partially it's not totally lifted\\xa0\\xa0 but then it's a sense of relief i'm sure you guys\\xa0\\ncan understand that we are allowed to go out in\\xa0\\xa0 the parks without mask and you know it's it's such\\xa0\\na relief i i should tell you guys and you know\\xa0\\xa0 poland is also recovering from covet and it's\\xa0\\ngoing great as of now a lot of friends and\\xa0\\xa0 family have asked us about you know what is the\\xa0\\nsituation about vaccination in poland but then\\xa0\\xa0 yes i can say that you know registration for 18\\xa0\\nplus of age has been already started and even\\xa0\\xa0 foreigners are eligible to take their vaccines uh\\xa0\\nuh prior registration only but with that said guys\\xa0\\xa0 welcome back to the channel i hope you all are\\xa0\\ndoing extremely fine and i cannot tell you guys\\xa0\\xa0 uh enough how exciting and how happy we are just\\xa0\\nto get vaccinated and you know so that the risk of\\xa0\\xa0 our life will be a little in a better situations\\xa0\\nand now that things are going very bad or rather\\xa0\\xa0 was in india i've been seeing pictures and videos\\xa0\\nand whatnot and you know it's it's really very sad\\xa0\\xa0 to hear all of it but then uh every single day i\\xa0\\npray to god for you know speedy recovery off the\\xa0\\xa0 wall and uh just that everything gets very well\\xa0\\nsoon and yes just hope for the best guys but i'm\\xa0\\xa0 sure you guys are totally safe and uh you guys\\xa0\\nare taking care of yourself but with all of it\\xa0\\xa0 guys let's just see what this video is gonna be\\xa0\\nabout and uh i'm very much excited for this video\\xa0\\xa0 because a lot of people had been asking me about\\xa0\\nwhat are the different types of visas available\\xa0\\xa0 for poland so there are multiple types of visa and\\xa0\\nthere are multiple type of uh questions and there\\xa0\\xa0 are a lot of confusions regarding what are which\\xa0\\ntype of visa should they go for and what uh what\\xa0\\xa0 which type of visa is exactly for what purpose so\\xa0\\nthis video is only going to be about the types of\\xa0\\xa0 visas that you will require to travel to poland\\xa0\\nso without wasting much time let's begin with the\\xa0\\xa0 video so for poland guys there are only three\\xa0\\ntypes of visas that's type a visa type c visa\\xa0\\xa0 and type d visa i'm going to explain each and\\xa0\\nevery single visa in detail and i'm also going\\xa0\\xa0 to tell you what are the documents that you would\\xa0\\nrequire for applying all these types of visas it's\\xa0\\xa0 pretty simple and i'm sure this is going to be\\xa0\\nvery helpful for you guys so let's just dive into\\xa0\\xa0 each type of visas that you would require for\\xa0\\npoland the first visa that we are going to talk\\xa0\\xa0 about now is a type a visa so guys type a visa\\xa0\\nis nothing but a transit visa which allows you to\\xa0\\xa0 travel through poland by that i mean you are\\xa0\\nallowed to only stay in the transit area and\\xa0\\xa0 neither you can exit the airport nor you can exit\\xa0\\nthe transit area either okay so it's just limited\\xa0\\xa0 to transit area and you are allowed to stay in the\\xa0\\ntransit area if you have type a visa and you want\\xa0\\xa0 to travel to another schengen country and this\\xa0\\nvisa is only required for people traveling from\\xa0\\xa0 afghanistan bangladesh democratic republic of the\\xa0\\ncongo ethopia gahana iraq iran nigeria pakistan\\xa0\\xa0 sudan and sri lanka so people traveling from\\xa0\\nthese bunch of countries are only supposed to take\\xa0\\xa0 a transit visa otherwise if you are from any other\\xa0\\ncountry apart from the ones that i just listed you\\xa0\\xa0 are not allowed or rather you are not supposed\\xa0\\nto take any transit visa you can just uh travel\\xa0\\xa0 uh without any hassle so for me when i traveled\\xa0\\nfrom india to poland i traveled from india like\\xa0\\xa0 bombay from frankfurt that's germany to warsaw and\\xa0\\ni didn't did not require any sort of transit visa\\xa0\\xa0 although i was coming from a schengen country\\xa0\\nwhich is germany of course so i hope this is very\\xa0\\xa0 much clear to you guys and now let's see what\\xa0\\nexactly is a type c visa so the second type of\\xa0\\xa0 visa that we are going to see now is type c visa\\xa0\\nso basically type c visa is a short term visa most\\xa0\\xa0 of the time uh if you are a tourist or if you are\\xa0\\nuh traveling to poland for a short term business\\xa0\\xa0 trip or something only then uh it is required but\\xa0\\ntype c visa is only valid for 90 days in a half of\\xa0\\xa0 a year that's it's only valid for 90 days in one\\xa0\\nout of 180 days so i am i hope this is not very\\xa0\\xa0 much confusing so you can only stay in poland\\xa0\\nfor 90 days at a stretch in half a year you can\\xa0\\xa0 split your uh days off stay in poland according\\xa0\\nto your feasibility so for example if you want to\\xa0\\xa0 stay important for one month and uh you know like\\xa0\\n30 days in the first trip then another 30 days\\xa0\\xa0 in the second trip and another 30 days in uh the\\xa0\\nthird trip but this has to be in half a year that\\xa0\\xa0 it should be in 180 days and not further than that\\xa0\\nit's a short-term visa where you are eligible to\\xa0\\xa0 travel to another schengen countries but that is\\xa0\\nalso only limited to 90 days out of the 180 days\\xa0\\xa0 i hope this is very much clear also to add from my\\xa0\\nside you are not allowed to apply for trcs not for\\xa0\\xa0 work permit if you come on type c visa to poland i\\xa0\\nhope this is clear guys if you have any questions\\xa0\\xa0 feel free to drop them in the comment section\\xa0\\nbelow and with that said let's see what exactly is\\xa0\\xa0 type d visa and what will be the documents that\\xa0\\nyou would require for all of these visas so guys\\xa0\\xa0 now it's the type d visa so type d visa is nothing\\xa0\\nbut the national visa which is uh which allows you\\xa0\\xa0 to live in poland at a stretch for one year okay\\xa0\\nthis is the best part and in poland you can apply\\xa0\\xa0 for your trc once the visa is about to expire or\\xa0\\nrather you can start applying for uh your trc well\\xa0\\xa0 in advance so that you know you do not get stuck\\xa0\\nin poland in case if you have to travel to your\\xa0\\xa0 country and you do not have a valid visa in that\\xa0\\ncase if your visa has expired and you do not have\\xa0\\xa0 a trc card in your hand already then you will\\xa0\\nhave to you will be eligible to fly back to your\\xa0\\xa0 country but then while returning back to poland\\xa0\\nyou will have to apply for a fresh type d visa and\\xa0\\xa0 only then come to poland just because you have\\xa0\\nthe stamp that you have you know submitted and\\xa0\\xa0 your application for trc has been uh in process\\xa0\\nyou are not allowed to travel to poland without\\xa0\\xa0 having the car you need the trc card in your hand\\xa0\\nand only then you can travel back to poland and\\xa0\\xa0 yes that's like the biggest visa for poland that's\\xa0\\ntype d and it's the national visa and for students\\xa0\\xa0 it's the same kind of visa it's the type d visa\\xa0\\nso basically they have type d visa and they have\\xa0\\xa0 multiple purposes of visa for which purpose are\\xa0\\nyou going to travel so that purpose also gets\\xa0\\xa0 printed on your passport or rather you're on your\\xa0\\nvisa so yes that is how it has been classified and\\xa0\\xa0 that is how it works in poland and talking about\\xa0\\nthe documents that you required for all of these\\xa0\\xa0 visas first thing you always require a valid\\xa0\\npassport which has minimum 10 pages left in it\\xa0\\xa0 also you need uh the passport size photographs\\xa0\\nbut then the passport size photographs are\\xa0\\xa0 the different in sizes they will mention on the\\xa0\\napplication form of the visa which exactly is\\xa0\\xa0 the size of the photograph that you require then\\xa0\\nyou need a an insurance which is uh which covers\\xa0\\xa0 you up to 30 000 euros yes that's a very huge\\xa0\\namount but then the insurance does not cost you\\xa0\\xa0 a lot which is you know uh it's it's kind of\\xa0\\naffordable also so i'm sure that is manageable\\xa0\\xa0 and uh most important thing is the accommodation\\xa0\\nwhere you're going to stay your itinerary that's\\xa0\\xa0 your flight tickets and also uh the fees of these\\xa0\\nthese types of visa that's the transit visa type\\xa0\\xa0 c visa and type d visa will not exceed than 70\\xa0\\neuros as of now okay it can be less but it's\\xa0\\xa0 not more than 70 euros but then that is as of now\\xa0\\ni'm not sure of what it would be in future but yes\\xa0\\xa0 these are the basic documents that you required\\xa0\\ni have also made a video on the checklist of vfs\\xa0\\xa0 which is required for your documents and for your\\xa0\\nvisa application i'll link it on the i button and\\xa0\\xa0 you guys make sure if you want to watch that video\\xa0\\nalso uh it will be very convenient for you to\\xa0\\xa0 understand what are the documents exactly that\\xa0\\nyou required for a visa application for poland\\xa0\\xa0 and with that said guys this is it for the\\xa0\\nvideo i hope it was informative for you and\\xa0\\xa0 it was helpful for you in a way and if it was\\xa0\\nmake sure to give it a big fat thumbs up and do\\xa0\\xa0 subscribe to my channel if you haven't done it yet\\xa0\\nit is free of cost and i put in a lot of efforts\\xa0\\xa0 to gather all this information for you and put it\\xa0\\nup here so please be kind enough and do subscribe\\xa0\\xa0 to my channel and i will see you guys in\\xa0\\nthe next one until then you guys take care\\xa0\\xa0 bye bye stay safe and take care of yourself take\\xa0\\ncare of your loved ones and everyone around you you\",\n",

       " 'Legendia and Energylandia are the two\\xa0\\nmost prominent theme parks in Poland.\\xa0\\xa0 Legendia is located in downtown Chorzow near\\xa0\\nKatowice and it is one of the country’s oldest\\xa0\\xa0 parks, opening in 1956 as Slaskie Wesole\\xa0\\nMiasteczko. However, this park has undergone\\xa0\\xa0 a massive transformation in recent years. The\\xa0\\npark has invested more in themed experiences\\xa0\\xa0 and this shift is what triggered the\\xa0\\npark’s name change to Legendia in 2017.\\xa0\\xa0 So is the park worth visiting today?\\xa0\\nFind out in this review of Legendia.\\n\\xa0 Few parks that have been around as long as\\xa0\\nLegendia have had such a seismic shift in\\xa0\\xa0 just a few seasons. Prior to 2000,\\xa0\\nLegendia had barely any attractions\\xa0\\xa0 and zero roller coasters. In the 1.5 decades\\xa0\\nthat followed Legendia started adding more rides.\\xa0\\xa0 Many of these attractions were\\xa0\\nportable or relocated attractions.\\xa0\\xa0 While they dramatically improved the quantity of\\xa0\\nthe park’s offerings, the quality felt more like\\xa0\\xa0 a permanent carnival than a true theme park.\\nThen in the past 5 years, Legendia has elevated\\xa0\\xa0 their game. Their new additions have been\\xa0\\naccompanied by nice landscaping and small themed\\xa0\\xa0 areas to boost the overall atmosphere and ambiance\\xa0\\nof the park. And the park went one step further.\\xa0\\xa0 They started renovating their prior attractions\\xa0\\ngiving them new names, paint schemes, and theming\\xa0\\xa0 to better tie in with the park. This facelift was\\xa0\\nso severe that it triggered this Polish park to\\xa0\\xa0 change their name from Slaskie Wesole Miasteczko\\xa0\\nto Legendia. And the name change was earned.\\n\\xa0 The only weird thing remaining is that the park\\xa0\\nhas several standing but not operating attractions\\xa0\\xa0 at the park such as the Scary Toys Factory roller\\xa0\\ncoaster and the crazy Circus Hoppola flat ride.\\n\\xa0 Not only does much of the park feel fresh between\\xa0\\nthe new additions and renovations, but it looks\\xa0\\xa0 beautiful as a whole. I love how the park is set\\xa0\\naround a central lagoon. It creates some awesome\\xa0\\xa0 vantage points, particularly of Lech Coaster\\xa0\\nand the massive Legendia Flower ferris wheel.\\xa0\\xa0 And then you have the kinetic energy of the city\\xa0\\nalong the outskirts of the part. Not only do you\\xa0\\xa0 have the usual hustle and bustle, but you\\xa0\\nalso have some unique attractions nearby\\xa0\\xa0 like the city skyride and a massive 295 foot\\xa0\\nor 90 meter tall bungee jumping experience\\xa0\\xa0 where you’re jump from atop a construction\\xa0\\ncrane. The latter was particularly captivating\\xa0\\xa0 whenever you saw someone ride to the top.\\nBut back to Legendia, admission in 2021 cost\\xa0\\xa0 me the equivalent of 26 USD when I purchased it\\xa0\\nonline in advance. That was a very good price\\xa0\\xa0 for a park as beautiful at Legendia that also\\xa0\\nhas an elite coaster like Lech Coaster. I also\\xa0\\xa0 splurged for the park’s Fastpass skip-the-line\\xa0\\nticket since it was only an additional $12 USD.\\n\\xa0 I visited on a beautiful summer Sunday and most\\xa0\\nrides were walk-ons. In fact, the lack of crowds\\xa0\\xa0 was an issue on my early rides on Lech Coaster.\\xa0\\nThe crew would deliberately hold back the train\\xa0\\xa0 for 10-15 minutes waiting for additional riders.\\xa0\\nA few other rides did this as well. If a ride\\xa0\\xa0 had a full trainload of people waiting, the crew\\xa0\\nwould load and dispatch trains fairly quickly.\\n\\xa0 The Fastpass came most in handy for Lech\\xa0\\nCoaster once that coaster built a steady\\xa0\\xa0 15-20 minute wait. I was able to basically\\xa0\\nboard every other train for Lech Coaster.\\n\\xa0 It also came in handy for the low-capacity\\xa0\\nDream Hunters Society roller coaster,\\xa0\\xa0 which had a steady half hour wait\\xa0\\nall day, and the water rides,\\xa0\\xa0 which had posted 30-60 minute\\xa0\\nwaits due to the warm weather.\\n\\xa0 One other operational note is that Legendia\\xa0\\nhas delayed openings for some rides\\xa0\\xa0 and early closures for others. The park\\xa0\\nhad a sign at the end of Main Street\\xa0\\xa0 informing all guests which rides were affected,\\xa0\\nso be sure to check this when you visit.\\n\\xa0 Moving onto the ride lineup, Legendia currently\\xa0\\nhas 3 operating roller coasters. The fourth in\\xa0\\xa0 Scary Toys Factory has been closed for the\\xa0\\npast two years. And this zyklon coaster\\xa0\\xa0 was also closed for a year straight from late\\xa0\\n2018 through mid-2019 before that. But it’s\\xa0\\xa0 a really redundant attraction, considering Dream\\xa0\\nHunters Society is a near-identical zkylon coaster\\xa0\\xa0 on the opposite side of the park. This is the\\xa0\\npark’s tamest roller coaster. It is surprising\\xa0\\xa0 Legendia no longer has a true kiddie coaster, but\\xa0\\nDream Hunters Society is a fairly mild experience\\xa0\\xa0 for families. The two drops have a little zip\\xa0\\nand the rest of the ride is pretty slow. And\\xa0\\xa0 it’s quite funny to see the operators manually\\xa0\\nhave to push the cars out of the station unlike\\xa0\\xa0 most coasters that are fully automated nowadays.\\nDiabelska Petla or Devil’s Loop is a Soquet double\\xa0\\xa0 looper with a history of relocations. The ride\\xa0\\nhas two forceful vertical loops reminiscent of\\xa0\\xa0 those on Schwarzkopfs, but the rest of the ride\\xa0\\nis relatively dull. That final helix is super slow\\xa0\\xa0 and doesn’t offer any positive Gs or laterals.\\xa0\\nThis coaster has a very simple layout,\\xa0\\xa0 but the ride interestingly has two backwards\\xa0\\nfacing seats towards the back of train. The\\xa0\\xa0 two loops are extra disorienting in those seats\\xa0\\nfor reasons I go into in a separate review.\\n\\xa0 Lech Coaster is the undeniable star at Legendia\\xa0\\nfor any coaster enthusiast and thrill-seeker.\\xa0\\xa0 The first and only Vekoma Bermuda Blitz\\xa0\\ncoaster represents everything right with\\xa0\\xa0 Vekoma’s newest roller coasters. This attraction\\xa0\\nhas incredible pacing, perfect transitions,\\xa0\\xa0 and awesome elements. This coaster is\\xa0\\none of the most intense in the world.\\xa0\\xa0 There are two sections where I experienced\\xa0\\nextended greyouts rivaling those on\\xa0\\xa0 Intmidator 305 each ride plus a few shorter\\xa0\\nspurts where I started to lose my vision.\\xa0\\xa0 And then for variety, the coaster also mixes in\\xa0\\nseveral moments of airtime. You have several bunny\\xa0\\xa0 hills plus one of the best first drops of any\\xa0\\ncoaster. This twisting, beyond-vertical plunge\\xa0\\xa0 offers a crazy combination of ejector airtime\\xa0\\nand strong laterals. This coaster is amazing\\xa0\\xa0 and I go into more detail in a separate review.\\nFor flat rides, Legendia has a very interesting\\xa0\\xa0 collection. There is a solid mix of pendulum\\xa0\\nrides and spinning rides for all ages. There’s\\xa0\\xa0 a dedicated kiddie area plus a decent assortment\\xa0\\nof family and thrill rides around the lake.\\n\\xa0 I was bummed to see Circus Hoppola in closed, but\\xa0\\nthe park had another shockingly good pendulum ride\\xa0\\xa0 on the opposite side of the park. Skyflyer is a\\xa0\\nVekoma kamikaze ride and if you love hangtime,\\xa0\\xa0 this is the ride for you. This inverting\\xa0\\npendulum operates with just lap bars\\xa0\\xa0 and it boasts a ridiculously long cycle\\xa0\\nthat clocked in between 6 and 7 minutes.\\xa0\\xa0 The ride didn’t offer any positive Gs on the\\xa0\\ndownswing, but it offered countless inversions\\xa0\\xa0 with top-notch hangtime, especially when you\\xa0\\npaused upside-down at a few points. You may just\\xa0\\xa0 want to hold onto your lap bar or else it will\\xa0\\nkeep lowering throughout the long experience.\\n\\xa0 Another cool thrill ride was Cyclodrome.\\xa0\\nThis is a self-operated inverting bicycle.\\xa0\\xa0 You strap yourself in and have to vigorously\\xa0\\nand rhythmically pedal. It required a good\\xa0\\xa0 amount of effort and technique, but it was\\xa0\\nvery rewarding to finally get that inversion.\\xa0\\xa0 And you also get rewarded with a little\\xa0\\nhangtime. Just beware the kickback of\\xa0\\xa0 the pedals when you’re traveling in reverse\\xa0\\nor slowing down. As you see in the video,\\xa0\\xa0 I had to lift my feet up to avoid getting pelted.\\nThen there are two classics worth experiencing.\\xa0\\xa0 Dream Flight Airlines is a flying machine that\\xa0\\nis the final original attraction at the park.\\xa0\\xa0 The ride itself isn’t particularly\\xa0\\nthrilling; it’s just rare and historical.\\xa0\\xa0 Then you have the Legendia Flower Ferris Wheel,\\xa0\\nwhich stands 131 feet or 40 meters tall, so it\\xa0\\xa0 offers great views of the park and nearby city.\\nTo beat the heat, you have two water rides.\\xa0\\xa0 Diamond River has the layout of a log flume,\\xa0\\nbut the larger boats of a shoot the chute ride,\\xa0\\xa0 so this one can get you soaked. Then you have\\xa0\\nDolina Jagi, which is a very well-landscaped\\xa0\\xa0 Hafema river rapids ride. This one is pretty\\xa0\\ntame. It doesn’t have any drops or whirlpools.\\xa0\\xa0 You just have a few mild rapids and a few extra\\xa0\\nwater effects that aren’t timed well enough\\xa0\\xa0 to do anything more than a dribble.\\nFinally, you also have a dark ride in Bazyliszek.\\xa0\\xa0 This screen based shooter reminds me of the\\xa0\\nJustice League dark rides found at the Six Flags\\xa0\\xa0 parks. You have to shoot at a bunch of little\\xa0\\ncharacters that are analogous to Lexbots. There\\xa0\\xa0 are also some 2D physical sets, but many of the\\xa0\\nphysical targets were broken during my visit.\\n\\xa0 The other weird thing with this dark ride\\xa0\\nis that it’s located inside a building\\xa0\\xa0 with a food court. And on that note,\\xa0\\nI did have a meal at Legendia.\\n\\xa0 I went to the burger restaurant near Diamond\\xa0\\nRiver and it pretty good. It was juicy\\xa0\\xa0 and bigger than expected.\\nSo do I recommend Legendia? I think\\xa0\\xa0 Energylandia is the best park in Poland because of\\xa0\\nthe quantity and quality of offerings there, but\\xa0\\xa0 Legendia is still a solid park. It has a quainter,\\xa0\\nmore relaxed feel with something for everyone.\\xa0\\xa0 And Lech Coaster is a world-class roller\\xa0\\ncoaster that would fit in at any thrill park.\\xa0\\xa0 You could easily spend a full-day at this park\\xa0\\nreriding things, but it’s possible to experience\\xa0\\xa0 Legendia’s signature rides in a half day.\\nSo those are my thoughts on Legendia, the fun\\xa0\\xa0 amusement park in Poland. What are your thoughts\\xa0\\non this park? Have you been there? I would love\\xa0\\xa0 to hear your thoughts about this Polish park down\\xa0\\nin the comments. If you enjoyed this review, I’d\\xa0\\xa0 appreciate it if you gave this video a like and\\xa0\\nyou considered subscribing since there will be a\\xa0\\xa0 lot more roller coaster and amusement park videos\\xa0\\nhere at Canobie Coaster.

this\\nis the road that Peter recommended close to the Belarusian border along the lakes into\\nLithuania this is great these old roads more military units over there they're all\\nstaying at the hotels there's heaps of military really big trucks here in this region non-stop\\non the border with Belarus plotted a route across a small border crossing route and it\\ntakes us on some unsealed road nice further give that uh e07 Dakar plus a bit of a test\\neh but this is what it should be made for the border is right here folks let's ride along the Polish Lithuanian border i can feel the Lithuanian air oh oh oh oh\\noh welcome to Lithuania also known as Lithuania yep got some Poland\\ngot some Lithuania yes i don't know if it's yes in Lithuanian might have to relearn everything\\nonce again and i just got into animals and food in Duolingo in Polish this really is the lake district this part\\nof the Baltics southern Lithuania i don't know like most of it just looks like more\\nlake than uh land probably how the Netherlands used to be glaciers back in the day i really\\ndug into the place it seems for real now crossing the borer another country a new one that i haven't been\\nto yet another one on the Baltic experience list and a bit of unsealed fun through the\\nbeautiful countryside here continues in Lithuania ah this is all a man needs in life oh the fuel is so expensive here again inflation\\ni'm considering uh to stay uh more than a few days out here you know in a nice natural\\nenvironment and where i can also get some work done for a few days ah look at this it's like apartments in the\\nforest uh hello speak uh pedro mota from booking.com\\nwe just arrived in town and we are in front of the uh apartment well apparently there\\nhas been a mix-up and this place already has been rented out somehow they offered an alternative\\nfor tonight we'll see then what happens after that but we got something for the night at\\nleast for a friendlier price we got the sorry you got involved in a mix-up price there we are almost home sweet home long overdue yesterday\\nthe apartment didn't go down so we ended up here they sorted us out with a different place\\nwhich is very nice for a mishap price but they also offered us the place upstairs we\\nhad with a balcony let's go have a look this little corner is actually really nice as you\\nsee and the fact that you sit here in between the trees it's also very nice but this is\\nthe place they offered also for the little mix-up and it starts off right away with the\\nlower floor very complete kitchen with a dishwasher it's got a lady good to have a lady in the kitchen and then\\nthere's an upstairs too this is the master bedroom and this is the guest bedroom here we can\\ninvite friends from Europe all they have to do is drive about a thousand eleven hundred\\nkilometers it's not much and then the cool part here is welcome down uh ma'am lady the rooftop terrace you see how it sits here\\nin between the trees so and this is for uh the same friendly rate of 30 euros that we\\nwere paying downstairs to be honest out here it actually looks like it has become a how\\ndo they say it in Dutch a blessing in disguise maybe it's too cold for taking a swim in the\\nlake oh damn it is coming right the good weather yeah so i was calling it the lake district\\nbut i think all of Lithuania is the lake district sort of no yes and no Druskininkai sits in a good place because\\nit has a lake in the center of the city we can also swim there's a beach and there are\\nseveral lakes around here but mostly there are lakes up in the north but this is perfect\\nhere for us that's my husband yeah and yesterday i heard your name like\\nfive times so oh snap yeah it was quite the topic you know oh no why is Pedro here but this has been great on the gravel road\\nhow did you like riding on the gravel road uh huh it was a bit bumpy wasn't it someone\\nbecame slightly more grabby oh wow thank you so much thank you wow oh this is a big skewer what\\nyou call this shashlik it was delicious been doing your Lithuanian\\nresearch because good morning is abbas but the l might be silent abbas let's go to the gym so here in Druskininkai\\nthere are no gyms we'll have to figure something out here at the local spa resort oh yeah very good yep we got weights we got all the\\nmachines in the world we got plates hell yeah not this time Arny but another place another\\ntime this was the Aqua gym sessions in Druskininkai ended up spending about 20 euros all together\\nfive euro per session so four times it was good best gym until now i think gym of champions\\nI got these at the supermarket real quick some of the chop chop because you're going\\nto need heaps of garlic shut up you do you even have more garlic here comes the good stuff they love this sort\\nof thing and we can top it up with a little bit of lemon squeezy baby here we go there we go say hello to my little friends hmmmmmm

English is\\xa0\\nspoken by the younger generation but not the\\xa0\\xa0 older one. They however are usually able to speak\\xa0\\nGerman or Russian. Poland is part of the European\\xa0\\xa0 Union but does not have the Euro yet. Instead,\\xa0\\nits currency is the Polish Zloty with one US\\xa0\\xa0 dollar currently equaling 0.24 Zloty. The weather\\xa0\\nin Poland is Continental: Summers will be hot and\\xa0\\xa0 Winters will be cold and snowy. As I've mentioned,\\xa0\\nin my opinion, Poland is hugely underrated. It has\\xa0\\xa0 so much on offer: from small sleepy Villages that\\xa0\\nseem as if time had stood still, to the bustling,\\xa0\\xa0 ever-developing Metropol of Warsaw. From\\xa0\\nthe white sandy beaches of the Baltic Sea,\\xa0\\xa0 that invite for a swim during summer and\\xa0\\nfreeze over during winter, to the lush green\\xa0\\xa0 forests and the Tatra Mountains. As well as the\\xa0\\nbeautiful ski resort and ski slopes of Zakopane.\\xa0\\xa0 And all of that for a very decent price. Not\\xa0\\nto mention the ever-present reminders of the\\xa0\\xa0 tumultuous European history of just a few decades\\xa0\\nago. But of course, to be a fantastic digital\\xa0\\xa0 Nomad destination, a country does not only have to\\xa0\\nbe interesting, it also needs some infrastructural\\xa0\\xa0 requirements. So let's take a look at them to make\\xa0\\nsure that you can work productively here. First\\xa0\\xa0 and foremost, as always internet. Free Wi-Fi is\\xa0\\navailable almost anywhere in Poland, particularly\\xa0\\xa0 in the bigger cities. It doesn't matter if\\xa0\\nyou're in a restaurant, a museum, or a mall.\\xa0\\xa0 Speed wise Poland ranks 31st in terms of broadband\\xa0\\nspeed with 107.26 megabits per second download\\xa0\\xa0 speed and 38.18 upload. Mobile internet speed\\xa0\\nranks 45th with 48.71 megabits per second download\\xa0\\xa0 speed and 10.30 megabits per second upload speed.\\xa0\\nWhen it comes to actual infrastructure, Poland is\\xa0\\xa0 an easy country to both get to, as well as travel\\xa0\\naround in. The biggest International Airport is\\xa0\\xa0 Warsaw International, but if you are already in\\xa0\\nEurope you might also be arriving by bus or train.\\xa0\\xa0 Since Poland joined the EU, the union has heavily\\xa0\\ninvested in modernizing Polish infrastructure,\\xa0\\xa0 which makes traveling around the country quite\\xa0\\nconvenient. In the bigger cities like Warsaw you\\xa0\\xa0 will also find a modern and inexpensive public\\xa0\\ntransport system, including buses and trams and,\\xa0\\xa0 in Warsaw also a Subway. when it comes to\\xa0\\naccommodation options you will find a lot of\\xa0\\xa0 choice with something for every taste no matter if\\xa0\\nyou wish to stay in a fancy hotel a modern Airbnb\\xa0\\xa0 a cozy wooden Lodge or a social hostel you will\\xa0\\nbe able to find just the right fit for you and\\xa0\\xa0 probably at a relatively decent price which brings\\xa0\\nus right to cost of living Poland is one of the\\xa0\\xa0 most affordable countries in the European Union\\xa0\\nparticularly when it comes to buying food you\\xa0\\xa0 will be able to find a tasty local meal for just\\xa0\\na couple of dollars a tip if you're on a budget\\xa0\\xa0 food wise is to visit one of the soviet-style\\xa0\\ncafeterias called milk bars where you can choose\\xa0\\xa0 out of a wide variety of local dishes and be\\xa0\\nserved over the counter out of a big pot don't be\\xa0\\xa0 fooled by the No Frills approach of these places\\xa0\\nthey are hugely popular amongst the locals and\\xa0\\xa0 the food is filling it's a decent sized portion\\xa0\\nit's very tasty and it's inexpensive but let's get\\xa0\\xa0 into cost of living numbers as always my numbers\\xa0\\ncome from nubio because nubio is a crowdsourced\\xa0\\xa0 inexpensive platform and are translated to US\\xa0\\ndollars because I believe that the dollar is a\\xa0\\xa0 more relatable currency for everyone around the\\xa0\\nworld a family A4 is estimated to pay 2143 US\\xa0\\xa0 dollars per month without rent a single person is\\xa0\\nestimated to pay 652 US dollars per month without\\xa0\\xa0 rent let's take a closer look at that shall we\\xa0\\nan inexpensive meal in a restaurant will cost you\\xa0\\xa0 approximately 8.46 a cappuccino will cost you 2.89\\xa0\\na monthly transport pass will cost you around 26\\xa0\\xa0 US dollars if you are staying in one of the bigger\\xa0\\ncities that I am recommending like Warsaw you will\\xa0\\xa0 have a very very modern public transport system\\xa0\\nwith buses trams and in the case of Warsaw also\\xa0\\xa0 a Subway which means that you probably won't have\\xa0\\nto pay much more than that for transportation taxi\\xa0\\xa0 starting cost comes at 1.93 a one kilometer taxi\\xa0\\nride will cost you 73 cents and basic utilities\\xa0\\xa0 for an apartment of about 85 square meters for a\\xa0\\nmonth will cost you around 200 33 US Dollars and\\xa0\\xa0 75 cents internet for the month would cost you 14\\xa0\\ndollars and seven cents a month and a one bedroom\\xa0\\xa0 apartment in the city center would cost you around\\xa0\\n638 US dollars a one bedroom apartment outside of\\xa0\\xa0 the city center on the other hand would cost you\\xa0\\nabout 524 US Dollars and this brings us to the\\xa0\\xa0 question of where to stay which city to make your\\xa0\\nhome base Poland is a huge and diverse country and\\xa0\\xa0 if you want to experience as much of its diversity\\xa0\\nas possible it might make sense to spend some time\\xa0\\xa0 in each of these cities and use them as a starting\\xa0\\npoint for smaller Adventures while still having\\xa0\\xa0 the digital Nomad infrastructure in place to\\xa0\\nwork productively in between excursions\\n\\xa0 well I guess I almost always start with a\\xa0\\ncapital and Poland's Capital Warsaw is such an\\xa0\\xa0 incredibly interesting place to start it is a huge\\xa0\\nMetropole and a perfect mirror of Polish culture\\xa0\\xa0 and identity Warsaw was completely destroyed\\xa0\\nby the Nazis during World War II yet the inner\\xa0\\xa0 core of the city has been painstakingly rebuilt\\xa0\\nto its original glory and is just gorgeous\\n\\xa0 surrounding it are some gigantous Soviet buildings\\xa0\\nreminders of Poland series behind the Iron Curtain\\xa0\\xa0 as well as hyper Modern Glass and steel\\xa0\\nskyscrapers that represent the young and\\xa0\\xa0 modern identity of Poland's younger\\xa0\\ngeneration here you will find all the\\xa0\\xa0 infrastructure you need to work productively\\xa0\\nfree Wi-Fi fast internet co-working spaces a\\xa0\\xa0 big expat Community as well as plenty to\\xa0\\ndo and discover in your free time\\n\\xa0 world-class museums moving reminders\\xa0\\nof the country's tumultuous history\\xa0\\xa0 Michelin star restaurants Cheap authentic\\xa0\\neateries buzzing nightlife and hip bars\\xa0\\xa0 on that note you might want to know that drinking\\xa0\\nin public if not purchased in a bar or restaurant\\xa0\\xa0 as well as being overly drunk in public is illegal\\xa0\\nin Poland but that's just as a side note Orso is\\xa0\\xa0 also conveniently located in the center of Poland\\xa0\\nwith excellent connections to the rest of the\\xa0\\xa0 country making it a perfect starting point for any\\xa0\\nof the other sites I will cover in this video\\n\\xa0 so what to do and see in Warsaw well let's start\\xa0\\nwith the old town if you're a sucker for details\\xa0\\xa0 warsaw's Old Town technically isn't that old\\xa0\\nsince as I mentioned it had to be completely\\xa0\\xa0 rebuilt after World War II while I've heard some\\xa0\\ncomplaining that this makes it less authentic and\\xa0\\xa0 just a tourist trap I could not disagree more\\xa0\\nand honestly find that thought rather ignorant\\xa0\\xa0 warsaw's old town is beautiful with\\xa0\\ncolorful houses cobblestone streets\\xa0\\xa0 and a gorgeous Castle as well as some\\xa0\\nremainders of the old city fortifications\\xa0\\xa0 it is a UNESCO world heritage site and has been\\xa0\\nrebuilt to its former glory it can't be a Disney\\xa0\\xa0 tourist trap because this is how it looked before\\xa0\\nit got destroyed right here in this place instead\\xa0\\xa0 as so much in Poland I consider it to be both a\\xa0\\nwindow to the past and a glorious sign of Polish\\xa0\\xa0 resilience strength and determination to preserve\\xa0\\ntheir cultural heritage instead of just giving up\\xa0\\xa0 and rolling over if you are into classical music\\xa0\\nyou might want to visit the Holy Cross church\\xa0\\xa0 hear the heart of the famous composer Chopin\\xa0\\nis preserved in a jar of alcohol and buried\\xa0\\xa0 Chopin originally polish and apparently longing\\xa0\\nfor his homeland all his life of which he spent\\xa0\\xa0 the majority of in France made the request\\xa0\\nthat his heart was to be cut out and buried\\xa0\\xa0 in Poland upon his death his older sister\\xa0\\nludwika fulfilled her brother's dying wish\\xa0\\xa0 and secretly removed his heart shortly\\xa0\\nafter his passing hiding it in a jar\\xa0\\xa0 of booze under her cloak and smuggling\\xa0\\nit to Poland the Warsaw Rising Museum\\xa0\\xa0 now even if you're not that much of a museum\\xa0\\nperson this is one of the two things you must\\xa0\\xa0 do in Poland to understand the remarkable Polish\\xa0\\npeople in my opinion the other one would be the\\xa0\\xa0 Concentration Camp of Auschwitz birkenau so let's\\xa0\\ntake a short but important history detour here\\xa0\\xa0 that will help you understand the significance\\xa0\\nof many of the sites mentioned in this video\\xa0\\xa0 on September 1st 1939 Nazi Germany invaded\\xa0\\nPoland thus marking the beginning of World War II\\xa0\\xa0 Germany was aided by the Soviet Union and Slovakia\\xa0\\nand the initial fighting lasted from September 1st\\xa0\\xa0 of 1939 to October the 6th of the same year after\\xa0\\nwhich Germany and the Soviet Union divided Poland\\xa0\\xa0 amongst themselves both occupiers but particularly\\xa0\\nNazi Germany raid with Terror in the country\\xa0\\xa0 Poland had before The Invasion been the country in\\xa0\\nEurope with the highest amount of Jewish citizens\\xa0\\xa0 three million or 10 of the population by the end\\xa0\\nof World War II around 380 000 were left\\n\\xa0 impressively Poland never stopped resisting with\\xa0\\nthe Warsaw Uprising in August 1944 being a huge\\xa0\\xa0 effort of resistance this Uprising should not be\\xa0\\nconfused with the uprising in the Warsaw Ghetto a\\xa0\\xa0 year earlier another impressive feat you should\\xa0\\nresearch further while here but back to Warsaw\\xa0\\xa0 uprising the Warsaw Uprising was a major Act of\\xa0\\nresistance by the Polish underground in an effort\\xa0\\xa0 to free Warsaw from German occupation it was\\xa0\\nthe single largest military effort taken by any\\xa0\\xa0 European resistance movement during World War II\\xa0\\nand went on for 63 days the Warsaw Rising Museum\\xa0\\xa0 commemorates this time in a gripping educational\\xa0\\nand awe-inspiring exhibition to get the most out\\xa0\\xa0 of the experience I strongly recommend an audio\\xa0\\nguide if not even a guided tour here the museum\\xa0\\xa0 is a little outside the city center but can be\\xa0\\nreached by bus and of course bike taxi or Uber\\xa0\\xa0 in the Center of Warsaw on Krasinski square and\\xa0\\nright in front of the Polish Supreme Court you\\xa0\\xa0 will also find a very impressive Monument\\xa0\\ncommemorating the Warsaw uprising and then\\xa0\\xa0 there are the reminders of the Warsaw Ghetto the\\xa0\\nlargest Nazi constructed ghetto for Jews during\\xa0\\xa0 World War II which you might know about from\\xa0\\nmovies like The Pianist conditions in the ghetto\\xa0\\xa0 were inhumane and to this day you can walk past\\xa0\\nseveral markers and landmarks commemorating it\\xa0\\xa0 here the Jewish population had their own Act of\\xa0\\nUprising and defines a year before the Warsaw\\xa0\\xa0 uprising it was a final effort to stop the Nazis\\xa0\\ntransporting the last remaining inhabitants of\\xa0\\xa0 the ghetto to concentration camps it was also the\\xa0\\nlargest single Revolt by Jews during World War II\\xa0\\xa0 last but not least to get back to present-day\\xa0\\nWarsaw and for a fantastic photo opportunity\\xa0\\xa0 and view over the entire city head to\\xa0\\nthe Palace of culture the ginormous\\xa0\\xa0 Soviet building Smackdown in town it has\\xa0\\na viewing Terrace on the 30th floor and\\xa0\\xa0 nowhere else in the city will you be able to\\xa0\\nenjoy such a spectacular view of Warsaw\\n\\xa0 the next Super popular city amongst tourists and\\xa0\\nexpats alike is no doubt Krakow in the south of\\xa0\\xa0 the country Krakow was visited by over 2 million\\xa0\\ntourists every year and is an absolute Beauty\\xa0\\xa0 it is the only major city in Poland that\\xa0\\nsurvived World War II in its original\\xa0\\xa0 state thus allowing you to experience the\\xa0\\npreoccupation Poland on a whole different level\\xa0\\xa0 the vavel castle seat of the Polish Kings\\xa0\\nfor centuries an impressive Lively Market\\xa0\\xa0 Square a beautiful Market Hall and the stunning\\xa0\\ncraftsmanship in each and every building\\n\\xa0 Krakow is a beautiful window to the Past\\xa0\\nyet even here in its Jewish District now\\xa0\\xa0 one of the hippest and liveliest areas in town\\xa0\\nhistory did not pass without leaving a mark\\xa0\\xa0 and this must be said for all of Krakow\\xa0\\nbut the city might have stayed intact this\\xa0\\xa0 does not mean that its inhabitants did not\\xa0\\nsuffer greatly under the occupation if you\\xa0\\xa0 are a devout Catholic you might like to know\\xa0\\nthat one of the inhabitants of krakov at the\\xa0\\xa0 time of occupation was a man named Carol voitella\\xa0\\nlater much better known as Pope Johannes Paul II\\xa0\\xa0 and as soon as you leave Krakow and drive just an\\xa0\\nhour westwards to the Polish border the evidence\\xa0\\xa0 of History could not be any more obvious at\\xa0\\nAuschwitz birkenau the world's biggest Nazi\\xa0\\xa0 concentration camp but let's step back a little\\xa0\\nbefore we get here why is it that karakov survived\\xa0\\xa0 in all its Glory but no other city did one of the\\xa0\\nreasons must have been that Krakow was chosen by\\xa0\\xa0 the Germans as their main administrative seat\\xa0\\nin Poland and thus did not get bombed\\n\\xa0 today Krakow is a young and bustling\\xa0\\nCity with an interesting nightlife and\\xa0\\xa0 bar culture thanks to its many universities and\\xa0\\nstudents you will have no problem communicating\\xa0\\xa0 in English here the internet is reliable\\xa0\\nthe public transport inexpensive there are\\xa0\\xa0 plenty of things to do both when it comes to\\xa0\\nmuseums track of even houses and original Da\\xa0\\xa0 Vinci painting cultural activities\\xa0\\nor excursions outside of the city\\xa0\\xa0 Krakow is also a fantastic base from which\\xa0\\nto take trips to the tatras mountains\\n\\xa0 in Krakow your first stop when discovering the\\xa0\\nbeautiful city will probably be the beautiful old\\xa0\\xa0 town with its enormous Town Square stunning Saint\\xa0\\nMary's Church The Majestic vavel Castle which used\\xa0\\xa0 to be the seat of the Polish Kings until the 16th\\xa0\\ncentury and is well worth a visit to see the rich\\xa0\\xa0 pre-World War II polish culture and lovingly\\xa0\\npainted buildings in the middle of the Town\\xa0\\xa0 Square here you will find the so-called cloth Hall\\xa0\\nan impressive renaissance building that used to be\\xa0\\xa0 krakow's main Trade Center these days the shops\\xa0\\nand offerings here are very touristy but going\\xa0\\xa0 anyways to Marvel at the beautiful architecture\\xa0\\nand soak up the Lively atmosphere Saint Mary's\\xa0\\xa0 Basilica is well worth entering as well it is\\xa0\\nfamous for its jaw-dropping wooden Altarpiece\\xa0\\xa0 as well as the trumpet signal that is played from\\xa0\\nthe top of the larger of its two towers the signal\\xa0\\xa0 stops mid-tune to commemorate a Watchman sounding\\xa0\\nthe trumpet alarm in the 13th century when the\\xa0\\xa0 city was attacked he was shot in the throat\\xa0\\nwith an arrow and thus stopped mid signal\\n\\xa0 particularly popular amongst children\\xa0\\nand those of us that have preserved their\\xa0\\xa0 inner child is the statue of the mythical\\xa0\\nvavel dragon at the foot of the vowel Hill\\xa0\\xa0 it's a huge dragon statue that breathes fire every\\xa0\\nfive minutes but the coolest feature is that the\\xa0\\xa0 visitors can make it breathe fire on Demand by\\xa0\\nsending a text message one of the hippest and\\xa0\\xa0 liveliest districts in town particularly to\\xa0\\ngo out for some drinks is the Jewish District\\xa0\\xa0 which still gives an interesting view into the\\xa0\\nrich Jewish culture in Poland pre-World War II\\xa0\\xa0 the majority of Jews did not survive the\\xa0\\noccupation but many buildings are intact and stand\\xa0\\xa0 as silent guardians of Jewish history and culture\\xa0\\none popular place to visit is Hebrew Cafe in an\\xa0\\xa0 old synagogue which partly survived you can sit\\xa0\\nhere and enjoy a cold beverage while marveling at\\xa0\\xa0 the original structure and stunning rare frescoes\\xa0\\nI should mention that while a very popular spot\\xa0\\xa0 its existence is not uncontested in the Jewish\\xa0\\nCommunity with some calling it exploitation of\\xa0\\xa0 Jewish culture and Heritage so it is up to you to\\xa0\\nmake up your mind whether you want to visit or not\\xa0\\xa0 if you have the time for some day or multi-day\\xa0\\ntrips carco is a great starting point for some\\xa0\\xa0 very impressive ones first of all of course\\xa0\\nthe Concentration Camp of auschwitzburg now\\xa0\\xa0 this might not be your funnest day trip but it\\xa0\\nis a very important one see the reason why I\\xa0\\xa0 am so passionate about introducing countries to\\xa0\\nyou explaining travel is because I passionately\\xa0\\xa0 believe that it brings all of us closer together\\xa0\\nif done correctly it helps us understand different\\xa0\\xa0 culture and tradition it opens our mind and heart\\xa0\\nfor other people's stories their bravery in their\\xa0\\xa0 tradition it helps us understand one another\\xa0\\nmore builds Bridges and hopefully dispenses\\xa0\\xa0 with predators and fear and Auschwitz book now\\xa0\\nthe world's largest Nazi concentration camp could\\xa0\\xa0 not be a more somber reminder of why it is so\\xa0\\nimportant that we understand each other even past\\xa0\\xa0 different cultures different languages different\\xa0\\nReligion different stories or how we look\\xa0\\xa0 and that is why I think everyone should go\\xa0\\nand visit here about 1.3 million people mostly\\xa0\\xa0 Jews were deported to Auschwitz and 1.1 million\\xa0\\nwere killed here if you can afford it you should\\xa0\\xa0 strongly consider paying for a guide here who\\xa0\\nwill put everything you'd see into context\\n\\xa0 if after this deeply moving experience\\xa0\\nyou would like your next trip to be more\\xa0\\xa0 uplifting one of Poland's most famous ski\\xa0\\nresorts at the foot of the tatras mountains\\xa0\\xa0 it's a beautiful village with wooden\\xa0\\nhouses and great ski slopes in winter\\xa0\\xa0 but even if you don't visit during winter zakopane\\xa0\\nis the perfect starting point for hiking trips\\xa0\\xa0 into the impressive rugged tatra mountains part\\xa0\\nof the capathions take a day hike for example\\xa0\\xa0 has a really beautiful 16 kilometer hike going\\xa0\\naround it or hike multiple days surrounded by\\xa0\\xa0 Lush Greenery impressive rock formations diverse\\xa0\\nwildlife and breathe the fresh air camping in

easily\\xa0\\xa0 do as a day trip visit the UNESCO world heritage\\xa0\\nsite of the Village Salt Mine which used to be\\xa0\\xa0 mined for salt until 2007. nowadays it offers a\\xa0\\nfantastic day trip activity from Krakow it reaches\\xa0\\xa0 a 300 meters of depth over nine levels and is a\\xa0\\nwhole City Underground with chapels restaurants\\xa0\\xa0 a lake restrooms exhibitions and so much more\\xa0\\nheck they even have designated Wi-Fi spots\\xa0\\xa0 popular route is to take the so-called tourist\\xa0\\nroute which takes you past the major attractions\\xa0\\xa0 on three of the nine levels bonus is that salt\\xa0\\nmines are widely known for their positive healing\\xa0\\xa0 effect of the respiratory tract so you're doing\\xa0\\nsomething for your health along the line the\\xa0\\xa0 third City suitable for digital Nomads and a\\xa0\\ngreat location if you wish to be by the sea is\\xa0\\xa0 Gdansk has a special place in my heart because\\xa0\\nit is the hometown of my late grandmother but\\xa0\\xa0 aside from that it is also just a stunning town\\xa0\\nby the coast of the Baltic Sea in Northern Poland\\xa0\\xa0 while much of it has been destroyed during World\\xa0\\nWar II it has been beautifully restored showcasing\\xa0\\xa0 the former glory of this wealthy trade hub\\xa0\\nit has a decently sized expat community and\\xa0\\xa0 reliable digital Nomad infrastructure it offers\\xa0\\nplenty of things to do has great restaurants and\\xa0\\xa0 cultural activities and you have access to the\\xa0\\nBaltic Sea it's also a good starting point to\\xa0\\xa0 continue onwards to Northern Europe with ferries\\xa0\\nfrom its Port leaving for example to Finland\\n\\xa0 are its beautifully restored Old Town that\\xa0\\xa0 so much in Poland was left in\\xa0\\nRebels after World War II\\n\\xa0 this is where you will find Saint Mary's Church\\xa0\\none of the two largest brick churches in the\\xa0\\xa0 world climbing up its Tower will reward you\\xa0\\nwith one of the best views of Gdansk\\n\\xa0 from the dance it's only a 45 minute bus\\xa0\\nride to the peninsula of Wester Plateau\\xa0\\xa0 where World War II started you can visit\\xa0\\nremainders of the barracks here as well as\\xa0\\xa0 a monument and the Museum of the second world\\xa0\\nwar which has very touching exhibitions and\\xa0\\xa0 leftovers from the war as

surface area and\\xa0\\npreviously home to the Titanic order\\n\\xa0 and then of course when it comes to outdoor\\xa0\\nactivities we can't forget about the seaside\\xa0\\xa0 Cadance is part of a so-called Tri-City together\\xa0\\nwith the beautiful seaside resort of sopot\\xa0\\xa0 characterized by its endless sandy beaches and\\xa0\\nbuzzing light life and Europe's largest wooden\\xa0\\xa0 pier and the smaller sleepier small town\\xa0\\nof Virginia spent some time by the beach\\xa0\\xa0 looking for Amber or just relaxing enjoy some\\xa0\\nwater sports or bathing or in Winter Marvel at\\xa0\\xa0 the fascinating site of the Baltic Sea freezing\\xa0\\nover and just enjoy a day by the water last but\\xa0\\xa0 not least the city I would like to recommend\\xa0\\nas a digital Nomad base is Rose love\\n\\xa0 it's a small but beautiful city for those of you\\xa0\\nwho enjoy a bit more of the quieter life since\\xa0\\xa0 a lot of international companies have their seat\\xa0\\nhere you will still find a sizable expat Community\\xa0\\xa0 to connect with it has a beautiful old town and\\xa0\\nis known for its many waterways and bridges\\n\\xa0 so well I hope that this gave you a taste of the\\xa0\\nbeautiful Poland its Treasures its history its\\xa0\\xa0 nature its people and everything else there is\\xa0\\nso much more I would like to show you like the\\xa0\\xa0 different national parks with biowowitza national\\xa0\\npark being home to the last wild advisons the\\xa0\\xa0 European bison that once used to roam so many\\xa0\\nof our European forests the Crooked Forest the\\xa0\\xa0 painted Village of zelipe but there's only so\\xa0\\nmuch one can fit into a YouTube video and I hope\\xa0\\xa0 that you decide to visit Poland and spend enough\\xa0\\ntime there to discover all its beautiful sights\\xa0\\xa0 for yourself so let's move on to the Visa options\\xa0\\nbad news first at the moment Poland does not have\\xa0\\xa0 a digital Nomad Visa however it does have a long\\xa0\\nstay freelance Visa that many of you could qualify\\xa0\\xa0 for I will get to how you can apply for that as\\xa0\\nsoon as we've covered the Short Stay option the\\xa0\\xa0 tourist visa if you want to stay in Poland for 90\\xa0\\ndays or less a tourist visa is the general option\\xa0\\xa0 keep in mind that technically officially even\\xa0\\nthough many digital Nomads have done so for\\xa0\\xa0 well probably decades by now you are not allowed\\xa0\\nto work on a digital on a tourist visa Poland is\\xa0\\xa0 part of the Schengen Zone and as such you\\xa0\\nwould have to get a tourist Schengen visa\\xa0\\xa0 by the way if you would like to know more about\\xa0\\nhow the Schengen Zone works and so on check out\\xa0\\xa0 this video up here generally what you need to\\xa0\\nknow is that in order to travel to Poland on a\\xa0\\xa0 tourist visa you would have to get a Schengen visa\\xa0\\nshould you need a visa that is which would allow\\xa0\\xa0 you to travel for 90 out of 180 days in the entire\\xa0\\nSchengen region these here are the countries who\\xa0\\xa0 need to apply for Schengen visa and cannot get\\xa0\\nan entry stamp or VISA upon arrival if you're\\xa0\\xa0 a citizen of one of these countries you will\\xa0\\nhave to apply for a Schengen visa which you do\\xa0\\xa0 at the closest Schengen or Polish Consulate keep\\xa0\\nin mind that even if you are allowed to enter the\\xa0\\xa0 Schengen Zone visa-free as of 2024 you will have\\xa0\\nto register through the ATS service ATS stands\\xa0\\xa0 for European travel information authorization\\xa0\\nsystem and in the near future probably from\\xa0\\xa0 2024 will collect your data for security reasons\\xa0\\nso depending on when you watch this video make\\xa0\\xa0 sure to double check if you need to register\\xa0\\neven if you do not have a Visa that you need\\xa0\\xa0 to present all right let's move on to the long\\xa0\\nstay V7 by the way if you would like to know\\xa0\\xa0 how to stay in the Schengen zone for an extended\\xa0\\nperiod of time possibly indefinitely check out\\xa0\\xa0 this video up here otherwise as I said for Poland\\xa0\\nspecifically there is a freelance visa and there\\xa0\\xa0 are several services online offering to assist\\xa0\\nwith that if you feel that the process might feel\\xa0\\xa0 a little overwhelming but for now the basic steps\\xa0\\nare as follows you should earn approximately 800\\xa0\\xa0 US dollars a month and you need to apply for the\\xa0\\nfreelance Visa via a consulate next you will need\\xa0\\xa0 to get some permits for which you will need your\\xa0\\npassport the first thing that you will have to get\\xa0\\xa0 is a pistol number which is kind of a personal\\xa0\\nidentify number I guess like a social security\\xa0\\xa0 number this number you will then need to get a\\xa0\\nbusiness bank account pay your taxes and take\\xa0\\xa0 part in health insurance you must also register at\\xa0\\nthis central registry of information on economic\\xa0\\xa0 activity which will provide you with the following\\xa0\\ntwo numbers the first number is called Regan and\\xa0\\xa0 is a number a business identifier number that\\xa0\\nwill place your business you as a freelancer\\xa0\\xa0 are basically your own one-person business so\\xa0\\nthis will place you and your business in the\\xa0\\xa0 business registry of Poland next you will need a\\xa0\\nnip number the nip number is the tax identifier\\xa0\\xa0 number which you will need to pay business taxes\\xa0\\nin Poland the business tax rate is approximately\\xa0\\xa0 19 and basically that's it now if this really is\\xa0\\nsomething that is interesting to you I recommend\\xa0\\xa0 that you get help from an agency mainly because\\xa0\\nall these numbers and you know all the working to\\xa0\\xa0 and from different authorities hoping that they\\xa0\\nwill be able to speak English and be able to\\xa0\\xa0 provide you with the paperwork in English might be\\xa0\\na little bit overwhelming generally my opinion is\\xa0\\xa0 this is a good option for you if you for whatever\\xa0\\npersonal reason or choosing want to really stay in\\xa0\\xa0 Poland for an extended amount of time the thing\\xa0\\nthat I personally find so beautiful with digital\\xa0\\xa0 Nomad visas on the other hand is that they're\\xa0\\nrelatively hassle-free meaning that it's kind\\xa0\\xa0 of a cookie cutter concept you know I mean\\xa0\\nyou kind of always need the same paperwork to\\xa0\\xa0 all countries that offer digital Nomad Visa\\xa0\\nyeah the income requirement might you know vary\\xa0\\xa0 a little bit and one might want a criminal record\\xa0\\nthe other doesn't but anyways generally you always\\xa0\\xa0 need the same paperwork so once you've done it\\xa0\\nonce or twice you kind of should get a hang of\\xa0\\xa0 it and if that isn't the case then I guess you\\xa0\\nhave several options you can take the Schengen\\xa0\\xa0 visa and move to Poland for 90 days and then\\xa0\\nleave the Schengen zone or hop in and out of\\xa0\\xa0 the Schengen Zone every 90 out of 180 days if you\\xa0\\nfeel that you would like to come to Poland more\\xa0\\xa0 often or you just pick a digital Nomad Visa of one\\xa0\\nof the indigenous Med visas in the Schengen region\\xa0\\xa0 and then use that to frequently come and visit\\xa0\\nPoland with that said that's it for today check\\xa0\\xa0 out my other videos about the Schengen visas and\\xa0\\nSchengen digital domain destinations and next week\\xa0\\xa0 we will move to one of the newest digital Nomads\\xa0\\nvisas on the Block which is the digital Nomad visa\\xa0\\xa0 to Uruguay which by the way currently also is the\\xa0\\neasiest digital Nomad visa to get out there but\\xa0\\xa0 more information on that next week so stay tuned\\xa0\\nstay safe and I'll see you here again bye bye\",\n",

They've been traveling\\nfor three days from Kyiv, standing still at a place not\\nknowing where to go next; and we were led to them. We just had a moment\\nof encouraging them, had a chance to give\\nthem a few necessities like baby carriers and\\nthings that would help them. We're putting them up\\nhere at a hotel for two nights so that they can just rest wrap their head around the\\nfact they're here over the border.

       " 'Hello, I\\'m Ken from Japan (Polish) This time... I uploaded a video of traveling to Gdansk and Lodz, actually I went to Warsaw before and after Lodz. To meet my friend. He\\'s only the best friend. I stayed at the friend\\'s house for a few days, and went to Lodz after that, I had enjoyable time It was the last time in Warsaw I really focused on hanging out with my friend too much, so I didn\\'t shoot a video Although this video might not be rich in content, I would like to share a bit of my time in Warsaw. So, I moved from Gdansk to Warsaw, and when I arrived in Warsaw, it was already night. The bus was about an hour late. I caused my friend trouble, but when I got his home , I thought it was really kind of him to prepare pizza like this. It was an authentic pizza, and it was super delicious I don\\'t know if it\\'s just my friends, but I have an impression that Polish people often cook anything by themselves like sweets or pizza even though they take time They are good at cooking, maybe Next day... I ate out with my friend and his girlfriend I uploaded a video about eating Tatar just once Then, there were many comment like, \"That\\'s a different way of eating it,\" and \"That\\'s not the original Tatar.\" After my friend saw them, he took me to eat the real Tatar The real one was different It was so delious Also in Japan, we have yukke, which is similar to that, but the vegetables around it are different These vegetables have a rather strong sour taste, and they eat raw meat with it Tatar are usually eaten with bread This pierogi. The one on the top is something like fried bacon, and it was really delicious. Restaurant on the ship My friend\\'s dog is so cute... I\\'ve really wanted to have a dog since I came to Poland Honestly, even if I can\\'t get married in the future, I feel that if I have a dog or a cat, I can live somehow Only non-barking and quiet dogs, though Then, my friend prepared ”kotlet”, which I wanted to eat It\\'s Polish pork cutlet It\\'s like a restaurant. His family prepared it, maybe Polish people are really good at hospitality They might be a little cold to strangers but they welcome to relatives or friends warmly The purple one was unfamiliar to Japanese people, so I was a little worried but it\\'s delicious, the texture is like between potato and seaweed. That was sweet and good (Friend) You don\\'t eat beetroot in Japan?\\n(Ken) No. In Poland, the staple food is bread or potatoes. People often have potatoes with this kind of dish Anyway, this kotlet is... good... The difference from Japanese pork cutlet is that panko is used in it but kotlet is wheat? It\\'s pretty soft on the skin, but there\\'s a lot of meat inside There\\'s no extra fat, no fatty mass unlike the Japanese one It\\'s easier to eat more and more Sometimes, Japanese pork cutlet makes me sick Also, it does match potatoes Including this cuisine, I\\'m thankful of everything my friend and his family did I can\\'t open my mouth despite my big body After this, I shot TikTok videos with my friend, so we\\'re discussing it Discussing what to do. Please watch it Again, the difference between both cutlets are that Japanese pork cutlet is quite thick But kotlet is thin so it\\'s easier to eat Right now, my friend said \"If you want more, let me know.\" And I said \"I\\'m fine, thanks.\" After all, I\\'ll have one more That was super delicious Kotlet, it\\'s one of my favorite Polish foods. Amazing Last Warsaw It\\'s been five months. Nostalgic~ I\\'m back to this square. Last time I saw it, it was winter, so there was an ice skate rink in the center but it was removed, and it\\'s back to what it was originally I again realized that Warsaw is awesome Beautiful. I was in love with it Unfortunately, I was there for about three days? but it rained for about 4 days and 3 days, so I didn\\'t see much of the sights But at the end, I went up to the observatory, which I\\'m familiar with when I travel, and looked out over Warsaw This is where I often saw in the picture I wondered where it is taken Beautiful It\\'s a little scary to look down from here By the way, I was satisfied with sightseeing in Warsaw. I felt a sense of security somehow It felt like my second home. After all, Warsaw is well organized Looks organized neatly. Well, there\\'s almost everything Streets are beautiful, so Warsaw is a nice place to live in Lastly, this tower And I went to the shopping mall as usual Actually, I had lived in Warsaw for 5 months so I was a little bored at that time And I was spending the Polish winter, so I was a bit depressed. After the time, I\\'ve traveled in several cities for about 6 months And after I came back to Warsaw, I realized Warsaw is amazing There was an atmosphere that you can only find in Warsaw Modern and old-fashioned style Only Warsaw have the combination of them Anyway, I had great time My friend is so kind, and when I had trouble, he would help me As for kotlet, I didn\\'t expect so much because I\\'ve heard it\\'s similar to Japanese pork cutlet I thought \"The Japanese one must be better.\" but it\\'s delicious... It\\'s more delicious than the Japanese one in normal shops So that\\'s it. I didn\\'t go sightseeing so much because it was raining At least I went to the observatory, and I made some good memories There\\'s almost no time for me to stay in Poland but I\\'ll go somewhere and eat something that I can until the last moment All right, thank you for watching. Have a nice day (Polish)',\n",

       " \"foreign [Music] [Music] good morning everyone we are on a\\nmountain trail going around Morskie Oko Lake leading us to another mountain lake called\\nCzarny Staw. Czarny Staw is on the way to the highest peak\\nof Poland called Rysy. It supposed to take us not longer than two\\nhours to get to that Lake, from there we will see how the weather will be maybe we will\\neven go to the top of Rysy and yeah pretty excited to see it, because it's the first\\ntime when I will be there it's hard to tell anything more, because it's not decided yet. We'll see what we'll do when we get there,\\nso see you later [Music] it took us around one hour to get the Chinese stuff from shelter\\nthe trail was very pleasant easy and then it was slightly stiff but I think that everybody\\ncan do that if you are at mosh keoko it's definitely worth to come here as both Lakes\\nare extremely beautiful and the views are just magical right now we're going over there\\nand we hope to see both Lakes from that point and to make some beautiful photos [Music]\\nso our goal for today was to get to the viewpoint on the way to Rysy. Rysy is the highest mountain peak in Poland\\nso it's a very popular trail and it's always busy there are many people so it's impossible\\nto be here alone it took us two hours to get here from the Schronisko Morskie Oko and the\\ntrail wasn't very challenging physically but if you're scared of heights it might be slightly\\ndifficult for you and scary, but believe me that the views are rewarding and it's totally\\nworth to come here. We spend a little bit of time here and now\\nwe're going down back to the shelter to have our breakfast [Music] thank you hey we're almost there and it's\\nCzarny Staw let's go [Music] it's 12:30 we just got down the mountain and\\nit's time for breakfast we bought ourselves very delicious traditional Polish food all\\nthe food here in the shelter it's below 10 euros but it's very delicious and despite\\nthat there are many people here they're cooking very fast we stay at the second floor On this floor we have four rooms.

       " \"yo what's going on guys my name is MI from Poland I'm here with Chris AKA Rudy Rudy he's from the UK and today we're going to be reacting to why Poland is quietly becoming Europe's next superpower all right so this is a bit different to the kind of stuff that we normally do um but we wanted to sort of delve into some other some other stuff about Poland um we we were looking at sort of some football some football related stuff some history related stuff and we thought you know what this is a good subject um and it's stuff that I've seen happening recently as well like Poland is you know the their military might cuz they because they're soose to Russia and stuff like that and um you know even when we've been there and and because I've been there twice this year it's you can see that it's just becoming you know better better exactly some people might disagree so let us know also comment on I was going to say comment down below what town you're from just curious if someone goes Leicester or something then I'm going to be from Bogner reg just no um yeah let's get straight into it this is the classic stereotype of Poland a gray poor postcommunist country with nothing to offer but cheap unqualified labor but this stereotype is no longer true and Poland of today looks more like this in the past 30 years Poland went through an incredible transformation growing more than any other economy in Europe and faster than Asian tigers like Singapore South Korea or Taiwan today Poland is emerging as a major technological Hub the Polish economy might overtake the UK by 2030 and after years of suffering from a massive brain drain highly skilled poles are now coming back home and it goes Way Beyond the I need to go back home yeah I don't think they're talking about you they said big brains big brains ex you left the brains went up if I come back I'm they're going to make a video why Poland is quietly not yeah why why Poland is not deining unknown reason why it's declining economy as Poland is building one of the most powerful militaries in Europe and quickly becoming one of the most influential European countries as all of these changes continue to pick up pace it's getting impossible to ignore Poland's growing importance but there is still one thing that could destroy the entire polish Miracle a threat not from the outside but from within so how did Poland manage to become Europe's biggest success story this guy set up the story he's like it's not Russia it's from within why is it doing so much better than everyone else and what is the challenge threatening to end everything that it has achieved this R very dramatic the [Music] rise but first a word from the sponsor of this video blink anyway um we'll skip that sponsor thanks for the video thanks thanks for the sponsor and now back to the video but to understand why Bin's transformation is such a big stand there weren't we I'm pretty sure we took a picture like down here or something like that yeah was it here yeah yeah we walked in into that part there or was it this bit we did it over in the park bit it was something like that no no no no no I mean no we recorded the short there yeah yeah yeah if if you guys haven't seen the short it's on the channel we recorded a short literally right down here um ear this year to be fair we went all around there bro yeah yeah yeah we need to understand where it started from in the 20th century after becoming the first country to be invaded by Nazi Germany and L 20% of its population in World War II Poland became part of the Eastern block as one of the Soviet controlled satellite States like in the rest of the Eastern block the 40 Years of Communism were times of deep economic isolation stagnation and overall I couldn't imagine sorry um I couldn't imagine like going like back in the day when there was like nothing on the shelves you know you'd go to get bread and like potentially these days is too much like I feel like we have too much on on on on on on the shelves like they throw stuff away I remember even here they throw literally boxes of drinks away and stuff like that when when it's not get sold and it's just it's just waste but hopelessness had to import the Soviet system of centrally planned economy where state owned almost everything private businesses were mostly non-existent and since they were basically a Soviet Colony the Polish economy was subservient to interests of the Soviet Union and forced to make Buy and sell whatever Moscow wanted it to whether it made economic sense or not as a result the centrally plant economy was deeply disfunction average Polish person today were average smiling Polish person back the back in the day we was already already given the Polish smile was deeply dysfunctional and mismanaged crippled by constant shortages of basic goods and lack of resources when the Communist regimes of Eastern Europe finally fell in 1989 and Poland became free free and independent it emerged from behind the Iron Curtain as one of the poorest countries in Europe with highly dysfunctional infrastructure and public services and with basically no experience with where start as like a as like a government where do you even start to like recover from something like that all your people are just un not are not highly educated there's no jobs no I mean that's not their fault it's the fault of the Soviet Union we've always been highly educated shut up and and this from a non-educated wasn't right here anyway Mari cier was the first woman to that wasn't during the Soviet Union you donut doesn't matter I'm talking about us being Highly Educated okay we're talking about look at me we're talk can you stop talking about yourself for a moment we're we're talking about years like Decades of being under Soviet Union control like where did you even start from that that that's probably why everyone left and started coming to countries like this America and stuff yeah and participating in a global economy the average salary was 10 times lower than in Germany and the country was struggling with hyperinflation in other words it wasn't a country you would bet on to become a major success but skip 30 years ahead into the future and that's exactly what happened so how did Poland do it from 1992 Poland managed to grow consecutively for almost three decades achieving the longest period of growth in modern European history now not many countries are able to do that and the reason is that usually when they find successful strategy they tend to stick to it long after it stops working but Poland so far managed to find a different growth strategy for each of the three decades which allowed it to grow so fast for so long starting in the early 1990s its main challenge like in every other post-communist country was how to transition from a centralized state-owned economy to a capitalist one in most countries these transitional reforms were in one way or another quite problematic either they took too long or they became pretty corrupt and bu of the state wealth was transferred into hands of a few wealthy oligarchs who got rich because of their political connections Poland on the other hand it's always like that it's always like there's some rich people they getting power and then they they take away the money for themselves they corrupt it and they make it worse for everyone below but it doesn't seem like based on what he's saying it doesn't seem like that's what happened in Poland because you do hear about Russian oligarchs and Ukrainian oligarchs who own so much and have so much money um and they're basically in charge of the country but I feel like it happens everywhere you feel like that's in Poland as well surely come on man yeah but I but what I mean is is like if that is the case it doesn't seem like it's affected the economy of the country in itself where it has countries like Ukraine and it's interesting because I don't know I hear lots of different opinions right um about Poland in general like from this video it looks like Poland's doing amazing and stuff but when I'm listening to some people they they don't think it's doing that well so guys us know that's why that's why this video has some dislikes as well I mean people will disagree with the situation and they will say no well for me it's not like that but if you're yourself living where you are now and you ask your parents who moved away from from Poland surely they would look back now and they would go it's probably much better than it was true and manage this transition arguably better than others it transitioned to capitalism quickly but privatized most of the state-owned companies slowly and a few years later than most of its neighbors after the chaos calmed down and after it became a little bit harder to steal everything thanks to that it became pretty much the only post-communist country without an economy dominated by oligarchs and without an economic crash in the 1990s but despite the Good Start in the early 2000s this wasn't enough anymore in order to grow and so the next phase was about globalization in 2004 Poland joined the European Union and the open European market with a free movement of goods and services without any barriers between Poland and the rest of Europe it made sense for Western European companies to move their manufacturing over to Poland where they had a large and a very cheap pool of workers at their disposal and while these companies kept most of the profit Poland got enough out of it to keep growing at a pretty fast pace and joining the EU brought another major benefit since one of its ke principles is redistribution yeah sharing and stuff so if Poland was down here and every other country was up here you know it's going to balance itself out for Poland this was good yeah but you say but Greece for instance um went bankrupt and it brought like the Euro down as a whole for instance and stuff like that and even even though that even though they were sort of part of the EU um maybe it didn't work out for yeah I mean it doesn't work out for everyone but I think in Poland's case it's different because they joined for a reason to be able to join like globally and stuff I don't know the full history yeah of money from wealthier member states to the less developed ones in order to balance the wealth disparity across the union after joining the Eastern European states started to receive a lot of money and Poland managed to use them to build and improve everything from roads to universities and again in a lot more efficient way than in many other Eastern European I think for sure roads have improved since like when I was there even just recently I was actually making a joke to everyone cuz I was like with people in the car and I kept making a joke like oh there's a bridge being built over there and like I said it once right and then I just kept making it a joke like every time there was a bridge being built I was like there's another bridge and like it was just like at one point I was like how many bridges are being built in like roads and everything it was like that when we were in warsa there's so much building going on there's so much development yeah like and it was crazy I when I used used to drive to my grandma's house right um from my dad's side bcha yeah bap's house um he used to take me take us about 4 hours now it would take about 2 hours really so they've just made like I guess they made tunnels and bridges and blah blah blah to make it much easier yeah highways highways yeah countries but that can still only take you as far in many countries following a similar trajectory eventually fall into the so-called middle inome trap if your economy is based on providing cheap labor for foreign companies you can only grow to a certain level and if you can't offer anything else apart from that and you don't have any major companies of your own you're stuck but so far Poland seems to be avoiding that 15 years ago foreign companies were coming in to hire low-skilled and low paid workers for menial labor but today they're coming because Poland has one of the largest pools of engineering talent in Europe and instead of where bro I'm telling you so many of my cousin friends all engineers and developers software developers and I I didn't know that PO had such a big movement on that side like I didn't I haven't heard of any even the teeken Warsaw apparently is crazy though like um and there's well I don't know if there's a lot of jobs but I think so it sounds like it B based on this video but I mean he but he's going to tell us what's going to bring Poland down soon warehouses and basic factories companies like Google are opening search and development hubs now that said Poland is still relatively poor at least compared with most of Western Europe but the growth so far has been impressive and unusually inclusive average wages in the country massively increased while inequality remained low and so it's not a growth that would only exist on paper or only help select few but it actually trickled down to the rest of the society and there's one more area outside of economic growth where Poland has been getting a lot of attention lately and that's milary also just before we go into the military I just wanted to highlight like when I've recently been to Poland and the the people that I've spoke to I feel like I don't know even just looking at like how much they were able to like go out and buy like we was going to like restaurants yeah and I was thinking this is quite expensive whilst I was bringing pounds right um and these guys were like yeah we can go out like eat once a week in a nice restaurant like stuff like that and I'm thinking you know that that's a good sign right um and also like clothes wise and what what um what jobs they're performing and how much they're earning not everyone was telling me that but some of the closer friends and stuff yeah um there's definitely a difference there there definitely it felt like everyone was living fairly um okay but then but then but then you but then you can feel that here as well can't you you can feel that here but then you can you can go out down the street and see a homeless person or you can go and find people that aren't living well and stuff like that yeah it's it's obviously different based on different people and stuff um yeah but but but let's see what the military say it's unprecedented military buildup historically Poland has some good reasons to be a little paranoid Stu between Germany and Russia it has been invaded partitioned colonized and stripped of its independence time and time again and even though today it's in NATO this historical memory is still there and while most European countries were taking their peace dividends Poland has kept military funding at one of the highest levels in NATO and after the Russian invasion of Ukraine it went into an overdrive it announced that in just a few years it will increase its military spending to 5% of its GDP higher than any other NATO member double the size of its Armed Forces to 300,000 and buy thousands of Tanks fighter jets and other military equipment and before the end of the decade Poland plans to have the most powerful ground forces in Europe in what would be one of the most ambitious military buildups in modern European history now that being said what Poland has achieved so far is impressive and what it plans to achieve is that kov or g g SC I see this is the thing I've seen a street in kov that has a tunnel like this at the end no it's not like that though yeah I know what one you're talking about um no this is din we got a picture there as well is it what right here yeah yeah yeah damn I we need to go back to put in again even more so but it's yet to be seen if all that will actually happen despite its successes there are some significant risks that could kill the entire polish miracle and not everyone is so bullish on Poland's future for a long time demography has been considered the number one threat as around half a million people have left the country in the last 30 years but now it looks like Poland managed to reverse this trend in recent years it has seen a what was it this place that whiskey in a jaw I remember we had food at this place in GL but I don't know if it was this one or if they no it was it was next to the river right yeah yeah first brain drain as poles and people with Polish Heritage living abroad have started coming back to the country and since the country tooken over 1 and a half million Ukrainian refugees the demographic TRS are looking much better and so there are really two major risks first while the growth has been impressive Poland has not actually avoided the middle income trap completely so far it's still massively reliant on foreign investments and although tech centers are being opened in Warsaw they are set up by Foreign companies rather than by polish yeah I knew this so much of it so this is what what what it's saying is maybe is that Poland needs its own companies it needs its own spill like needs its own Googles and Samsungs and whatever's um built up but then how do you I feel like it's difficult in a market like that to be able to bring something in and have it dominate when you've got so many other massive companies that dominate everything else um I mean I'm I'm sure it come there are some there are some ones and while that brings jobs and growth once again there is a limit to how high you can grow since most of the profits will always end up leaving the country in the end in order to break into the big leagues you need your own domestic Giants in sectors with high eded value and Poland doesn't have that or at least not yet but the far bigger risk is of a completely different nature and it concerns a part of the Polish story that we haven't touched on yet the thing is that Poland is a deeply deeply divided country so much that we can almost talk about two different polands one liberal and Progressive and the other deeply conservative and religious like in the US the two that is I think that is a problem what a problem kind like the same as the American side of things where there are there are two there will always be two very different groups of people that that that want to see change you'll have the people that and I feel like you've had in con Poland's had this group of people who are you know so patriotic and and and they've been in power for so long now what if now what if a different government comes into Power based on younger people more liberal side of it who who want to see a lot of stuff legalized like you know like the LGBT side of things which isn't legal in Poland um you know that could cause a rift in in the way things like it does in America you got so many different group so staunch different views like I mean we saw it ourselves in G we walked through literally an LGBT protest with people in skull masks and and and other people waving the flags and stuff and police anti protest yeah like it was yeah and that I think that's that's one of Poland's thing if you look at it from the outside cool but yeah it is divided in terms of it people Civil War coming are finding it increasingly difficult to coexist together and surveys show that both sides are highly suspicious of each other intolerant to opposing views and increasingly refusing to compromise and for years the current conservative government has been criticized by the liberal opposition for supposedly bending the rule I mean obviously things are changing now as well with all the voting I'm not actually too sure as of today of what's Happening um I'm not really following it that much but things are changing um so we'll see if it's forther better but who knows yeah RS in order to stay in power and it has had a growing beef with the European Union that's threatening to cut Poland off from EU funds as a punishment for not upholding the rule of law and the thing is that whatever side you cheer for the end result is bad for both and for Poland in general the country needs both parts of the population to coexist and work together and it needs the EU if it wants to be truly successful and if it doesn't manage to do that the Polish Miracle will be over soon before it has really started damn he's he to be fair I think he made some good points in there I think he talked about some good stuff um thanks to explained with dom um obviously for this video and um yeah it's it was really good actually understanding what the different where it's come from what it's done and where it could go like some there's definitely some good like theories of how it could go and what what it need what Poland needs to do to to get to a to get to a good point basically um yeah good video um informative thoughts what do you think gonna happen I just well what do you want to happen what I want to happen is for Poland to keep growing obviously I mean that's that's crazy by 20 was it 2030 or 2060 2030 it could be a bigger economy than the UK like that's mad but then again our government here is just [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah I feel like Poland might be going up UK might be going down so yeah yeah it's it's it's a it's good it's great it's interesting though maybe I can go back one time maybe one day not one time get him out guys um anyway but yeah guys let us know what you think let us know what you think is going to happen your your theories what you think of Poland and where you think it's going to go just yeah let let us know in the comments um and if you want to see more videos like this uh just let us know as well leave some recommendations and thank you again to explained with dom for the video very good we'll link that in the yeah we'll link that in the description make sure to

       " ' Well, yes I am in the city of Leszno That is the Greater Poland Voivodeship Poland Well, my transport is delayed 10 minutes, so I can tell you that I\\'m going to the Czech Republic Because one professor invited me there He wants me to make a presentation about the Interslavic language Moment Well, so  And I thought to take use this opportunity to do a little reportage From that excursion around Europe And on the Slavic land Well, recently I was in the center of the city of Leszno And you can see short fragments from this walk I didn\\'t have much time But No problem Here, you can see classic Polish constructions Houses colored houses From the 19th century colorful houses with ornaments Some buildings should be renovated Some renovation should be  Home renovation would be nice\\n32\\n00:02:08,017 --> 00:02:11,368\\nrecoloring, and so on making a repairs But you can think how beautiful that would look if all houses were so colorful and with ornaments And here for example, I think, that is, already a more communistic construction a socialistic-like flat It\\'s windy and you won\\'t hear anything Okay, well, well, Wait a moment, I still don\\'t know how to work with this But I\\'ll give you a question: for what reason  I came to this street? To Lešno? I wanted to show you that\\n50\\n00:03:20,095 --> 00:03:17,833\\nThat is the Slavic Street, \"Słowiańska\" in Polish And why is it so special? simply there is such a street in many Polish cities with such a name in the city of Poznan, for example And also in the city of Wrocław there are not only Slavic streets  but also the streets of many Slavic tribes for example, like the street of the Polabian Slavs Lech, Czech and Rus streets Serbian street Lutici street from the Lutici tribe and so on and so forth That is an interesting phenomenon I don\\'t know how it is in other countries maybe in Turkey for example, there are streets with names of all the Turkic nations Or for example in Germany there are streets with names of the Germanic nations and tribes it would be interesting to see  it look, it\\'s there a classical Polish building colorful ornaments you can see different ornaments In Polish that type of home is called „kamienica” for being made of stone (kamenj), obviously stones here we have a beautiful street with trees if there are trees is in the city I already,  like  without waiting such a city Just lot of trees make a better atmosphere in the place a lot of plants, greenery well for example, it can be also a tree like that but it might be difficult to make it grow for a long time in such a small pot Grncu, grně Yes In the Interslavic language, it will be \"grn\" or \"grnec\" at that moment, I don’t remember which word is better intelligible Sadly we cannot look at all structures, monuments and statues that are in the city of Leszno for the fact that I need to depart in about half an hour to continue the travel to Wrocław… This is simply an experimental video I want to see what will be the result of it, but it\\'s the firs time  I create such videos Umbrellas this Obviously it must have some symbolic meaning but I don\\'t know what\\n121\\n00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.248\\nmaybe you can write that under the video I would like to show you something common in this part of Europe that means: in every city in Central Europe There is a city structure a city scheme in line with Magdeburg rules If I remember it well that name. This means: every city has the main square A main center of the city for example, I spoke with Ukrainians they said, that in their cities it\\'s not like that There\\'s no central place There is something like the historical center of the city but there are just historical houses There\\'s no central square I\\'m not an expert but you can see all cities even very small cities have something like that In the villages the center of the village was the church and in the cities it was the house of politicians the house of the head of the city as you can see here in Polish it\\'s “ratusz” and, obviously really colourful, beautiful buildings kamienice you can see them, you can walk waste time, play, like the children here buy something to eat and so on You can walk in small streets sitting in restaurants caffes and just have a nice time eat something burgers or traditional Polish food I have to say this the main square main city center is in a good condition Well that is… many, many buildings are in good condition I like this place beautiful houses it\\'s good, it\\'s good traditional Polish food, kebab from India I don\\'t even know where the kebab is from from India, or from the Arabs, or from Persia I do not know Ah, see, a musician I like it a lot I also played a few times on the street Let\\'s talk to him Let\\'s see if he will understand me Good day! Excuse me, can I record the video? (Polish-Russian)\\nAh, greetings, I know, I had to learn Russian I was solding electronics from Vienna in Lviv  Oh, very good, very good Can I make a video? -With me? -Yes. Okay, but in front of that, I\\'ll be beautiful. OK OK Listen, Do you know any traditional Polish songs? I can play almost every Polish song And German also And the Russian ones:  \"Ljegko na sierce ot pjesnji viesioloj\" I learnt it, but it\\'s been a long time and I don\\'t remember - Please, play. - Yes, there is no need to waste time Some... a Polish, traditional song Thank you very much Well, here, right? What a disgrace appeared in Europe, sir! Yes, disgrace Are you a famous musician? Well, look, look how many people, there was a record, not far from here, Osieczna city, Osieczna And that\\'s me That was a competition, right? No, we were beat the record for the number of accordionists Gathering, people gathered Yes a gathering of accordionists Look, how beautiful girls there are here, near the town hall Look, I had an accordion, Do some photos Well, wait... They are Ukrainians they played here Ukrainians played? Yes take a photo \\n2 3 4\\n00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,062\\nWell, it\\'s a video what is your name? Ryszard Ryszard? Andrei also Okay, thank you, sir! And you? I\\'m Michal Michal? Yes And my son is Mikolaj Hah, see No, he\\'s Artur Mikolaj Okay, thank you for playing Dear people, if you see... Spasiba, danke schon, merci, and in Polish? Thank you! Thank you! Dear people, if you will see Mr. Ryšard\\nyou can give him something Michal, you speak really nice, you really nice Thank you, thank you very much Bye, a healthy summer vacation to you! I want to give you something What? I talk a lot and then I don\\'t remember I don\\'t give much, boy, but that\\'s for you Ah, nothing is written here, wait it was somewhere I want to give you my address as well When you come back to your place sometime send me a nice postcard, Okay if you\\'ll remember Obviously Well, here\\'s the address Thank you, it was Mr. Ryszard from Leszno And, there is also a photography Well, we had a good talk, thank you Again, bye! Bye, bye! Well, dear people, the first experiment was very successful if you see Mr. Ryszard in city \\u200b\\u200bcenter in Leszno in the city of Leszno you can give him some money in order to allow him to continue to play the accordion Ah, it is necessary to go back There\\'s no much time I need to go  in the Czech Republic, we\\'ll see Oh, what a beautiful building unfortunately, it also needs a little renovation, but look at this beautiful ornaments It\\'s a post office very beautiful unfortunately it\\'s windy and also there are many noisies from aut from the engines but let\\'s see how it\\'ll be, if you will hear me well or not I could tell his man Ryszard, Mr. Ryszard that it\\'s no Ukrainian or an another Slavic language but that\\'s Interslavic but I didn\\'t have time to explain what is Interslavic what is this project but as you can see, the communication was effective very good I am satisfied of that experiment we move on to Tanvald Czechs, you will have an Interslavic visit The wind here is terrible By the way, that song played by Mr. Ryszard I know it It\\'s the song \"Maryjanna\" And it\\'s a classic romantic song There is a guy who loves a woman And, simply, she doesn\\'t want him And so he sings about it and then goes to the army and he has no gril anymore but he only has a gun in his hand A history is equal to the 80% of traditional songs But the melody is beautiful, so…',\n",
       " \"WITH SLOVAKIA AND BEYONCE WILL FOLLOW SUIT. ADRIAN. ALL RIGHT, JOE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ON NEWSNATION, SENIOR RETIRED AIR FORCE LIEUTENANT GENERAL RICHARD NEWTON HERE WITH ME RIGHT NOW TO TELL US. EXACTLY WHAT THIS MEANS AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE U.S. WE'VE GOT SLOVAKIA JUMPING INTO THE RING. SHE VISITING MOSCOW AT PUTIN'S INVITATION. MIND. YOU AND THEN PULL IN SENDING THOSE FIGHTER JETS TO UKRAINE HAS THIS WAR MOVED TO A NEW LEVEL. WELL, GOOD MORNING, ADRIAN. I THINK IT'S SIGNIFICANT POLLS AND NOW WE HEAR ABOUT THE WILL BE SENDING A MAY 29 AIRCRAFT. INTO THE FIGHT. I THINK IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING. IN MY OPINION. I PROVIDING MAY 29TH IN THIS CASE WILL BE A BACKFILL FOR SOME LOSSES AT UKRAINIAN AIR FORCE AS A HAS HAD TODAY. BUT NONETHELESS, IT POLLS AND HOPEFULLY OTHER NATO OTHER ALLIES WILL WILL COME IN. THE FACT THAT BUT THESE MAY 29TH IT WILL HELP UKRAINE DEFEND ITS SKIES AND ALSO PROVIDE FOR, I BELIEVE SIGNIFICANT. SUPPORT TO GROUND FORCES AS THIS. WHAT I THINK WILL BE A NEAR TERM SPRING UNDER WAY AGAINST THE RUSSIAN DUGGAN FORCES ESPECIALLY IN THE EASTERN PART OF UKRAINE IN THE DONBAS REGION. BUT IN TERMS OF THE KINDS OF PLANES THAT ARE BEING SENT SOVIET ERA PLANES. AT THE END OF THEIR LIFE. I MEAN. WHY SEND OUT. WHAT'S THE POINT IF THEY'RE NOT UP TO DATE. WELL THERE THERE ARE GOING TO BE STILL SIGNIFICANT AND THE THE FACT THERE'S A STALEMATE RIGHT NOW BETWEEN BOTH ON THE GROUND. BUT ALSO THERE, NOBODY REALLY HAS THEIR THESE AGAIN, AS YOU SAY, THE 1970'S HERE MAY 29TH COULD BE JUST ENOUGH IS A TIPPING TO THAT ABILITY FOR UKRAINE'S TO CONTROL THEIR SKIES. THEY ALSO, HOWEVER, THESE MAY 29TH CAN CARRY WOMAN SYSTEM SUCH AS HIGH ANY RADIATION MISSILES FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF THE SOVIET AIR DEFENSES CAN ALSO PROVIDE A EXTENDED JOINT DIRECT ATTACK MUNITIONS THAT THE UNITED STATES AND PROVIDE WHICH STANDOFF CAPABILITIES TO STRIKE TARGETS WITH SOME MODICUM OF PRECISION FROM 45 MILES OUT. SO I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT. THESE FOR JUST A START. I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE MORE THAN JUST 4, BUT NONETHELESS, I I THINK IT'S SIGNIFICANT AND I THINK IT COULD BE A GAME-CHANGER FOR THE UKRAINE'S. BUT IN TERMS OF COMPARING THEM TO THE F 16 IS WE KNOW UKRAINIAN TROOPS ARE ACTUALLY CURRENTLY IN THE U.S. TRAINING. ON THOSE JETS UP IT EVEN THE U.S. WILL ACTUALLY JUMP IN TO ACTUALLY SEND FIGHTER JETS TO UKRAINE AS A RESULT OF SOME OF THESE MOVES BY NATO'S ALLIES. MY SOURCES REALLY HAVEN'T CONFIRMED THAT THERE ARE BEING TRAINED. BUT I DO KNOW THAT THE UKRAINE HAS SET UP A LINE ABOUT 55 LUTZ AND SHOULD THE UNITED STATES AGREED TO TRAIN F 16 F 16 IN THE MAY. 29 ARE FAIRLY COMPARABLE. F 16 HAS SOME ADVANTAGES OVER THE THE MAY 29 IT'S MORNING IN A TIGHTER TERM MANEUVERING CAPABILITY. IT'S GOT A PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT MORE MODERN WEAPONIZE OUR WEAPON ON BOARD. THE AIRCRAFT HAS GOT GREAT VISIBILITY IN THE SO. THE MAY 29 CZAR START. I WOULD ALSO ADVOCATE FOR. F 16 FROM UNITED STATES OR OTHER NATO PARTNERS TO ADD TO THE AIR POWER ARSENAL. BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS POINT, IF UKRAINE'S GOING TO WIN FOR CRANES GOING DEFEAT THE RUSSIANS. FOR. IT IS GOING TO BE KEY PROVIDING THAT KEY AIR POWER ON THE GROUND FOR GROUND FORCES ENGAGE WITH THE RUSSIAN TROOPS. AIR POWER IS GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANT. AND SO I THINK WE SHOULD BE\",\n",
       " \"  Hi how are things? I'm Xavi Luque . Welcome to another video on my channel . If you like the content, don't forget to subscribe at the bottom where the description is, or on the button above . I'm going to go to Poland. With Poland in the Eurovision Song Contest.

Good voice . We entered 2001. The first song in English? If I'm not mistaken You already know that I prefer each country to sing in their own language, I really don't care. But to prefer, better in their own language Ich Troje, I don't know how to pronounce it! My friend Lukas is going to kill me haha \\u200b\\u200bI remember this band in 2005 or 2006 I loved this song! The voice of the girl Also because there are some phrases in Spanish I remember this song A Romani group Romani with O! Ich Troje, 2006 was! I loved this song I didn't understand how it didn't make it to the final I remember the singer was pregnant I loved this song ! I did not understand or understand how it did not go to the final An easy letter but I like Brutal the voice of this woman If I have not misunderstood it was a chorus girl Of the very Beyoncé!! I love this song I would have also liked to see it in the final It was one of my favorites of 2009 She sings very well and the song was very good I've been following her for a long time on social networks Magdalena Tul And without going to the final, what???!

       " 'Over 500,000 refugees from 125 countries\\nhave already found safety in Poland. Polish borders are open to all\\nrefugees fleeing Russian aggression. You can find the link to guidelines for all refugees in the\\ndescription of this video. Poland decided to accept all nationalities right\\nfrom the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine Poland is ramping up its efforts to\\nsupport refugees fleeing Russian aggression On the Polish\\nside of the border, hundreds of people wait in long line\\nto offer transportation to those in need. There are currently hundreds, if not\\nthousands of initiatives designed to help people inside Ukraine\\nand the ones who flee the war. Poland created a dedicated website\\nestablished to coordinate all the support and provide vital information\\nfor those in need. Despite all these efforts,\\nthere is a substantial number of outlets reporting false information\\nregarding Poland. Reports suggest Poland is blocking various\\nnationalities from fleeing war in Ukraine. This is false and hurtful. What we\\'re seeing now is a mix of miscommunication, Putin\\'s propaganda\\nand just lazy journalism, I guess. Here\\'s the example I\\nrecently stumbled upon. BBC News heartbreaking story about Gabriel, a Nigerian student\\nfleeing war through Poland. And Gabriel, you were telling me a little bit earlier about what happened to you\\nwhen you were trying to board onto the trains. What was your experience\\nof trying to get out of Ukraine? It was a very terrible experience for me. Like last ten days in Ukraine was very difficult for me\\nas I was expecting the military. They were very mean. They were just too mean to us. No humans, no food, nothing, no support. It was just on your own. All they said was \"go to your embassy\". If your embassy is not there,\\nthe rest is up to you. And this was in Lviv. Just to clarify, this was in Lviv. So how did you get\\nto the border with Poland? Yeah, we walked for like 12\\nhours from Lviv to Poland. We walked for like 12 hours. Also mine was like 12\\nhours with no food and nothing. You just have to and then when you got to the border,\\nwhat happened to you? What did you see? That was one of my worst experience. The soldiers\\non duty that it was mean. They were just so heartless. They treated us like animals totally. There were no human sympathy in any of them. There were some who did come around those places, the soldiers, the borders. We saw some of them with some\\nweapons that we tried to make. So just understand that we are seeing\\nthese weapons and he said we should go and there\\'s nothing you can do about it\\nand we\\'re like we can risk our life. So they started chasing\\nus away, hitting us. You can see that he hit my leg. The reaction on Twitter, to quote just a few:\\n\"Poles are only allowing white people in\" \"Polish border guards are racist\" This made me sick. Millions of Poles are helping war refugees\\nof all nationalities on daily basis. There\\'s a lot of things you can say about Poland but the way we\\'ve conducted\\nourselves during this crisis, during this war is definitely\\nsomething we should be proud of. So I reached out to BBC\\nto confront them about the story. Thanks to your support,\\nthey\\'ve noticed my comment and decided to replace their 40-second\\nvideo with a longer one. The longer video allowed\\nGabriel to finish his story. You can see that he hit my leg right here. Gabriel, when you got over the border, then when you were in that bit coming\\nup to the Polish part, what happened? Yeah, Polish. They were nice to me. At least they worked on me. Give you food. I had one or two conversations\\nwith you, a little bit of relief. I feel like I\\'m accepted again. thank you so much\\nfor sharing your experience. Thank you so much for talking. Now this is pure example of how easy it is to\\nmanipulate information to divide people. 40-second version of the video about Polish\\nborder and Poles are racist bunch who are providing help exclusively\\nto white refugees. Full two minute version of the video and Poles are heroes providing help\\nto all regardless of their nationality. Unfortunately, more and more news\\noutlets are making similar mistakes. Here\\'s another example where popular French media outlet La Figaro displayed\\na map of countries supporting Ukraine. Poland was excluded despite our country being a front line of support\\nto the Ukrainian people. After confronting reporters, they\\'ve updated the map to include\\nPoland as well as the Baltic countries. Yet another story includes a BBC live\\nbroadcast that suggests that some of the Putin\\'s planes were\\nstationed inside Poland. Yeah, I mean inside NATO country,\\nwhich is obviously false. I\\'m sure this is not an example of Putin\\'s\\npropaganda, but yet another mistake. This is why in the difficult times like\\nthis, it is so vital to be precise in the way we communicate\\nspecifically journalists. This is why we all need\\nto fact-check and verify. You can find links to fact-checking\\ntutorials in the description below. Activists at the border confirm various\\nnationalities find safe haven in Poland. This includes a popular\\nSpanish-American chef, José Andrés. So guys, I\\'m here\\nwith Jennifer from Nigeria. I just met her here. She\\'s been walking like many others for many hours, if not many days because\\nthe situation is difficult to leave Ukraine to come, because no cars,\\nno gas and many other issues, I guess. But I was asking her because they were\\nsaying that if Poland and other countries were not allowing citizens from different\\ncountries, especially of Africa. And what do you have\\nto tell us about that? We didn\\'t actually face\\nany problem coming here. We just got to the border and then we just had stamped our visas and everything. So I met some people from Congo with her. I saw some people from Jamaica. I saw people from India from different\\ncountries around the world. But I\\'ve seen people from different\\ncountries in Africa and I agree with her. Everyone tell me no problem. So don\\'t worry. We\\'re trying to do the government\\nof Poland and other governments. They are trying to do their best\\nto take care of the people. Thank you for sharing this with you. And best of luck. People from all over the World appreciate Poland\\'s help to refugees fleeing the war\\nthis includes an inspirational story of Indian refugees fleeing\\nRussian aggression. When the Soviet Union invaded Poland, an Indian Prince gave refuge to thousands\\nof Polish children escaping gulags. His Navanagar came to be\\ncalled Little Poland. Tonight, 80 years later,\\nPoland returned the favor. Thank you Adam Burakowsky. India won\\'t forget this. He mentioned Adam Burkowsky,\\nambassador of Poland to India. So just to clarify, I\\'m not\\ntrying to say it\\'s all perfect. When 1 million people flee war, we can\\nsee what\\'s best and worst about humanity. It is not surprising to hear about\\nviolence, racism, bribery, looting. There\\'s no justification for this. And we should prosecute\\nall those responsible. That being said, these dark episodes\\nshould not define who we are. Ukrainians are defined for their\\nunprecedented bravery. They are an inspiration to whole free World. Poles are defined through millions\\nof people providing meaningful help on daily basis to refugees\\nof all nationalities. Right now more than ever, we need to stand together rather than\\nto look for reasons stand apart.',\n",

       " 'Over 500,000 refugees from 125 countries\\nhave already found safety in Poland. Polish borders are open to all\\nrefugees fleeing Russian aggression. You can find the link to guidelines for all refugees in the\\ndescription of this video. Poland decided to accept all nationalities right\\nfrom the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine Poland is ramping up its efforts to\\nsupport refugees fleeing Russian aggression On the Polish\\nside of the border, hundreds of people wait in long line\\nto offer transportation to those in need. There are currently hundreds, if not\\nthousands of initiatives designed to help people inside Ukraine\\nand the ones who flee the war. Poland created a dedicated website\\nestablished to coordinate all the support and provide vital information\\nfor those in need. Despite all these efforts,\\nthere is a substantial number of outlets reporting false information\\nregarding Poland. Reports suggest Poland is blocking various\\nnationalities from fleeing war in Ukraine. This is false and hurtful. What we\\'re seeing now is a mix of miscommunication, Putin\\'s propaganda\\nand just lazy journalism, I guess. Here\\'s the example I\\nrecently stumbled upon. BBC News heartbreaking story about Gabriel, a Nigerian student\\nfleeing war through Poland. And Gabriel, you were telling me a little bit earlier about what happened to you\\nwhen you were trying to board onto the trains. What was your experience\\nof trying to get out of Ukraine? It was a very terrible experience for me. Like last ten days in Ukraine was very difficult for me\\nas I was expecting the military. They were very mean. They were just too mean to us. No humans, no food, nothing, no support. It was just on your own. All they said was \"go to your embassy\". If your embassy is not there,\\nthe rest is up to you. And this was in Lviv. Just to clarify, this was in Lviv. So how did you get\\nto the border with Poland? Yeah, we walked for like 12\\nhours from Lviv to Poland. We walked for like 12 hours. Also mine was like 12\\nhours with no food and nothing. You just have to and then when you got to the border,\\nwhat happened to you? What did you see? That was one of my worst experience. The soldiers\\non duty that it was mean. They were just so heartless. They treated us like animals totally. There were no human sympathy in any of them. There were some who did come around those places, the soldiers, the borders. We saw some of them with some\\nweapons that we tried to make. So just understand that we are seeing\\nthese weapons and he said we should go and there\\'s nothing you can do about it\\nand we\\'re like we can risk our life. So they started chasing\\nus away, hitting us. You can see that he hit my leg. The reaction on Twitter, to quote just a few:\\n\"Poles are only allowing white people in\" \"Polish border guards are racist\" This made me sick. Millions of Poles are helping war refugees\\nof all nationalities on daily basis. There\\'s a lot of things you can say about Poland but the way we\\'ve conducted\\nourselves during this crisis, during this war is definitely\\nsomething we should be proud of. So I reached out to BBC\\nto confront them about the story. Thanks to your support,\\nthey\\'ve noticed my comment and decided to replace their 40-second\\nvideo with a longer one. The longer video allowed\\nGabriel to finish his story. You can see that he hit my leg right here. Gabriel, when you got over the border, then when you were in that bit coming\\nup to the Polish part, what happened? Yeah, Polish. They were nice to me. At least they worked on me. Give you food. I had one or two conversations\\nwith you, a little bit of relief. I feel like I\\'m accepted again. thank you so much\\nfor sharing your experience. Thank you so much for talking. Now this is pure example of how easy it is to\\nmanipulate information to divide people. 40-second version of the video about Polish\\nborder and Poles are racist bunch who are providing help exclusively\\nto white refugees. Full two minute version of the video and Poles are heroes providing help\\nto all regardless of their nationality. Unfortunately, more and more news\\noutlets are making similar mistakes. Here\\'s another example where popular French media outlet La Figaro displayed\\na map of countries supporting Ukraine. Poland was excluded despite our country being a front line of support\\nto the Ukrainian people. After confronting reporters, they\\'ve updated the map to include\\nPoland as well as the Baltic countries.

       " \"in recent days poland has witnessed an unprecedented event in its modern history the migration crisis on the polish belarusian border is the first clear example for polish society of a change in the structure of the global order polish political elites so far preoccupied mainly with internal power struggles were mercilessly awakened from their geostrategic sleep why did lukashenko cause a crisis on his own border what scenarios are possible and what does the new polish army have to do with all this welcome to the 20s report [Music] border crisis war is a tool for achieving political goals in this sense a traditional kinetic war such as world war ii is no different than a hybrid war fought locally and with relatively few resources hybrid war or to be more precise hybrid conflict for this is how all actions below the official threshold of war are defined includes among others social activities weaponization of migrants information warfare and the activities of special forces and or paramilitary groups the world has observed such actions since at least 2014 the era of russia's aggression against the ukraine the next iteration of this form of political pressure is taking place now through the precipitation of a migrant crisis by the republic of belarus in mid-2021 the belarusian regime headed by alexander lukashenko launched a new migration channel at first the target was lithuania but after some time the belarusian authorities redirected the inflow to the polish border on november the 8th 2021 events escalated with several thousand and possibly more migrants being transported to the brewski kuznetsov border crossing interestingly a few days earlier on november the 5th at the meeting of the council of the union state of russia and belarus the two countries signed a package of integration agreements it assumes among other things the adoption by russia and belarus of a common migration policy and military doctrine this fact together with statements made by high-ranking russian politicians confirmed alexander lukashenko's belief that his actions have the full support of moscow one might ask why lukashenko needs a conflict on the border now the answer may seem simple it's clear that minsk's actions are a form of revenge by lukashenko against poland lithuania and the european union in general for supporting the belarusian opposition after the 2020 elections as well as for the sanctions imposed on his regime it is almost certain however that belarus's hybrid actions are above all part of the internal belarusian russian game with belarus acting as moscow's political bumper while it pursues its goals of destabilizing the eu's and nato's eastern flank as well as ukraine in fact the recent number of coinciding events is puzzling on november the 8th the data crisis escalated the lenergo a belarusian energy company announced that it was immediately breaking its contract to supply electricity to ukraine at a time when the country is currently experiencing an acute energy crisis perhaps there would be nothing surprising about this were it not for the fact that deliveries had begun only seven days earlier what's more moscow had recently stopped deliveries of gas through the yamal pipeline which runs through belarus and poland and on to germany and the eu although lukashenko boasts that belarus will buy gas from russia at prices several times lower than those paid by european countries blocking yamal will effectively cut off belarus from revenues generated by gas transit which gives the kremlin another tool to pressure lukashenko there is also speculation in the press about the dislocation of nuclear weapons to belarus and about extending the lease of two military facilities for another 25 years on the other hand belarus still does not formally recognize the annexation of crimea which russia considers a slap in the face although lukashenko makes it clear that informally this has already happened the kremlin expects a formal stance from him despite the seemingly friendly relations between minsk and moscow we were in fact dealing with a constant game of smiles and declarations in the foreground while in the background a merciless struggle for efficiency and political maneuvering is taking place it is likely that destabilization of the polish border is an additional tool for lukashenko to use in his maneuvers with moscow for example unleashing a crisis and allowing moscow to be the final arbiter may be traded for resumption of russian gas transportation through yamal the escalation of the border crisis is in the interest of the russian federation which treats it as part of its bullying strategy and as a form of pressure on western states while formally not bearing any responsibility for it the migration crisis fuels social and political discord in poland and tests the resilience of poland's security system its armed forces and nato as a whole information warfare one of the most important domains in any modern conflict including this current border crisis is the infosphere it is not important what happens on the ground what matters is the message that goes out to the world whoever wins the narrative war is the de facto winner of the entire game the russian and bella russian authorities report that the west is responsible for causing the migration because it supported american moves in the middle east the belarusian side and the russian language media accuse the polish state of inhumane actions and of violating human rights these include the forcible detention of migrants forcing their way across the border and the use of tear gas to repel the assault all of this is most often fueled by images of women and children appearing online this narrative is being joined by some political circles in poland who are calling for the admission of those camping at the border which is in line with the goals of belarusian propaganda the question that needs to be asked at this point is are we dealing with a humanitarian disaster now according to the european court on human rights poland must provide food clothing medical care and if possible temporary shelter to migrants camped at their border however belarus refuses to allow poland to send a convoy into its territory with humanitarian aid for migrants thus refusing to provide assistance besides it is clear that all people who received a visa to belarus first had to prove that they had sufficient funds for accommodation in normal life functions in belarus the price that migrants had to pay to smugglers approved by the lukashenko regime according to various media leaks ranges anywhere from 2500 to 15 000 the lukashenko regime sees this money in order to use these people instrumentally for its own game when the first people realized that they were victims of fraud they tried to return to the airport but the belarusian police turned back cabs transporting migrants this culminated in the belarusian authorities transporting these migrants to the border and then cutting off their way back in a word middle eastern migrants are now prisoners and hostages of lukashenko who plays with human lives to achieve his own political goals belarus used to operate several dozens of flights per week from dubai baghdad damascus beirut and importantly from istanbul and antalya this would not have been possible without the tacit approval of turkey holden's ally within nato whereas poland and turkey recently signed an agreement for the delivery of turkish baryaktar tb2 unmanned aerial vehicles worth over a quarter billion dollars the turkish ministry of foreign affairs denies that it supports lukashenko's smuggling activities but it is likely that polish-turkish relations will be damaged as a result as expected eu and nato countries reacted very differently to the crisis on their eastern border although lukashenko's actions have been condemned at the declaratory level and a fifth package of sanctions has been announced their impact is likely to be reduced relative to the initial intentions for example one of the sanctions is to exclude bellavia the state-controlled belarusian air carrier from the market for aircraft leasing contracts now this would effectively ground their aircraft because it would force minsk to buy them back for which it has no money however ireland where most of the providers of such services are located opposed the scenario proposing that sanctions be imposed only on new leasing contracts another idea was to exclude belarus from the global agreement on aviation data sharing but here too the lukashenko regime is preparing to get around that by creating a common aviation space with russia and a joint administration to manage it it's not difficult to guess that declarative support comes mainly from berlin one should remember that poland is only another stop on the way to germany so the polish buffer for the germans is very useful in this case although now the german media report that single groups of migrants from the direction of belarus have found their way to germany just as importantly the current game can be costly for belarus and russia a sudden influx of thousands of migrants destabilizes the situation in belarus if lukashenko does not bring the situation under control his legitimacy in the eyes of many influential people in his own regime's departments who in practice ensure his power may decrease the sanctions package imposed on belarus has not resulted in a freeze of trade on the contrary as belsat reports in the first nine months of this year trade with eu countries has increased by more than 40 percent and is now back to pre-pandemic levels the main trade partners of the republic of belarus remained germany and poland therefore a complete closure of the border with poland would be a real blow to minsk it would be equally costly for moscow since the main land route connecting russia with the european union runs through belarus added to that there is a dry cargo port moushaviche on the border with belarus this is the largest dry port in europe hundreds of trains from east and central asia are bound for it as part of the chinese belt and road initiative moashevich handles 90 of all goods brought from china to europe by rail if belarus climbs up the escalation ladder warsaw may take steps to close this artery this would certainly be met with a reaction from moscow and potentially even from beijing now it should also be remembered that the nordstream 2 gas pipeline which is crucial for the kremlin remains inoperable although it is very close to completion it is still a potential disciplinary tool in the hands of the west poland effectively guards the border so further steps up the escalation ladder by the republic of belarus are likely this may include provocations with weapons interestingly in the russian city of kazan the forces of the collective security treaty organization or russian nato are practicing protecting a refugee camp and exporting convoys with humanitarian cargo it is therefore possible that after a series of escalations vladimir putin will suddenly enter the game introduce russian guards to the border and present himself to the world as a stabilizer of the situation which will be welcomed with relief and even gratitude by western countries such a reaction in moscow will be taken as a success and confirmation that this type of policy brings the intended results the media reports that angela merkel has already made the first call to putin asking for help in solving this crisis on the border the end of strategic sleep the november crisis on the border was preceded by another very important event in poland perhaps even a breakthrough ending the period of strategic sleep in which polish policymakers have been stuck since the 1990s the leader of the law and justice party deputy prime minister yaroslav kaczynski who in practice is now the most influential politician in the country held a press conference about the fracturing of the world order hybrid war and russia's offensive posture he also pointed out the limited ability of nato to help poland in a new generation war which may last only a few days or weeks so by the time nato troops or the americans to be precise come to help it could already be over thus he stressed the need for poland's military autonomy which is not manifested itself in the views of the ruling party so far in response to these challenges kaczynski announced that poland must be able to defend itself and for this purpose it needs a large army perhaps several times larger than the current army of about a hundred thousand active duty troops and another fifty thousand reservists expert and strategic environments although they welcomed kaczynski's assessment of the situation immediately raised the question how much will a majorly beefed up polish military cost a well-equipped army of 250 to 300 000 for such of the estimates being given in the media would be a huge burden on the polish national budget it's all the more doubtful since poland despite currently allocating quite a large amount of money for defense its defense budget is comparable to that of israel or of turkey has an army with much smaller capabilities increasing the number of personnel which due to demographics is already difficult will only further dilute these capabilities grassroots polish think tanks are pushing for a debate on this issue and demand a very conscientious reform process so as not to throw big money down the drain although the outlook on the reform of the armed forces is not uniform all experts agree that a modern army should first of all have a high saturation of capabilities it is not the quantity but the quality of units that is most important according to the swedish military think tank foi despite the fact that the polish army presents a certain value on nato's eastern flank it suffers from low personnel and poor quality of the equipment used according to foi up to 75 of it is obsolete therefore declarations of a 250 000 strong army are simply unrealistic at the moment however a correct assessment of the situation is the first step towards useful change an unexpected side effect of the belarusian-induced migration crisis which is at least declaratively supported by russia may be an increase in public support for the idea of reforming the polish army conflict on the border is a reminder of the ruthlessness of the relationship between states for the last 30 years living under the american and eu umbrella in a unipolar world polish elites as well as its society at large have forgotten about this principle nothing is a given forever a modern military capable of protecting the state's interests is the foundation of the nation's functions and relations this was the 20th report as some of you know i'm polish so the events discussed in the video are quite close to me and whether i like it or not i'm exposed to the media operations in this area however i have tried to present the topic in the least biased way if that's even possible thank you for your attention today and see you next time [Music] you\",\n",
       " \"yo what's going on guys my name is MI from Poland I'm here with Chris AKA Rudy Rudy he's from the UK and today we're going to be reacting to why Poland is quietly becoming Europe's next superpower all right so this is a bit different to the kind of stuff that we normally do um but we wanted to sort of delve into some other some other stuff about Poland um we we were looking at sort of some football some football related stuff some history related stuff and we thought you know what this is a good subject um and it's stuff that I've seen happening recently as well like Poland is you know the their military might cuz they because they're soose to Russia and stuff like that and um you know even when we've been there and and because I've been there twice this year it's you can see that it's just becoming you know better better exactly some people might disagree so let us know also comment on I was going to say comment down below what town you're from just curious if someone goes Leicester or something then I'm going to be from Bogner reg just no um yeah let's get straight into it this is the classic stereotype of Poland a gray poor postcommunist country with nothing to offer but cheap unqualified labor but this stereotype is no longer true and Poland of today looks more like this in the past 30 years Poland went through an incredible transformation growing more than any other economy in Europe and faster than Asian tigers like Singapore South Korea or Taiwan today Poland is emerging as a major technological Hub the Polish economy might overtake the UK by 2030 and after years of suffering from a massive brain drain highly skilled poles are now coming back home and it goes Way Beyond the I need to go back home yeah I don't think they're talking about you they said big brains big brains ex you left the brains went up if I come back I'm they're going to make a video why Poland is quietly not yeah why why Poland is not deining unknown reason why it's declining economy as Poland is building one of the most powerful militaries in Europe and quickly becoming one of the most influential European countries as all of these changes continue to pick up pace it's getting impossible to ignore Poland's growing importance but there is still one thing that could destroy the entire polish Miracle a threat not from the outside but from within so how did Poland manage to become Europe's biggest success story this guy set up the story he's like it's not Russia it's from within why is it doing so much better than everyone else and what is the challenge threatening to end everything that it has achieved this R very dramatic the [Music] rise but first a word from the sponsor of this video blink anyway um we'll skip that sponsor thanks for the video thanks thanks for the sponsor and now back to the video but to understand why Bin's transformation is such a big stand there weren't we I'm pretty sure we took a picture like down here or something like that yeah was it here yeah yeah we walked in into that part there or was it this bit we did it over in the park bit it was something like that no no no no no I mean no we recorded the short there yeah yeah yeah if if you guys haven't seen the short it's on the channel we recorded a short literally right down here um ear this year to be fair we went all around there bro yeah yeah yeah we need to understand where it started from in the 20th century after becoming the first country to be invaded by Nazi Germany and L 20% of its population in World War II Poland became part of the Eastern block as one of the Soviet controlled satellite States like in the rest of the Eastern block the 40 Years of Communism were times of deep economic isolation stagnation and overall I couldn't imagine sorry um I couldn't imagine like going like back in the day when there was like nothing on the shelves you know you'd go to get bread and like potentially these days is too much like I feel like we have too much on on on on on on the shelves like they throw stuff away I remember even here they throw literally boxes of drinks away and stuff like that when when it's not get sold and it's just it's just waste but hopelessness had to import the Soviet system of centrally planned economy where state owned almost everything private businesses were mostly non-existent and since they were basically a Soviet Colony the Polish economy was subservient to interests of the Soviet Union and forced to make Buy and sell whatever Moscow wanted it to whether it made economic sense or not as a result the centrally plant economy was deeply disfunction average Polish person today were average smiling Polish person back the back in the day we was already already given the Polish smile was deeply dysfunctional and mismanaged crippled by constant shortages of basic goods and lack of resources when the Communist regimes of Eastern Europe finally fell in 1989 and Poland became free free and independent it emerged from behind the Iron Curtain as one of the poorest countries in Europe with highly dysfunctional infrastructure and public services and with basically no experience with where start as like a as like a government where do you even start to like recover from something like that all your people are just un not are not highly educated there's no jobs no I mean that's not their fault it's the fault of the Soviet Union we've always been highly educated shut up and and this from a non-educated wasn't right here anyway Mari cier was the first woman to that wasn't during the Soviet Union you donut doesn't matter I'm talking about us being Highly Educated okay we're talking about look at me we're talk can you stop talking about yourself for a moment we're we're talking about years like Decades of being under Soviet Union control like where did you even start from that that that's probably why everyone left and started coming to countries like this America and stuff yeah and participating in a global economy the average salary was 10 times lower than in Germany and the country was struggling with hyperinflation in other words it wasn't a country you would bet on to become a major success but skip 30 years ahead into the future and that's exactly what happened so how did Poland do it from 1992 Poland managed to grow consecutively for almost three decades achieving the longest period of growth in modern European history now not many countries are able to do that and the reason is that usually when they find successful strategy they tend to stick to it long after it stops working but Poland so far managed to find a different growth strategy for each of the three decades which allowed it to grow so fast for so long starting in the early 1990s its main challenge like in every other post-communist country was how to transition from a centralized state-owned economy to a capitalist one in most countries these transitional reforms were in one way or another quite problematic either they took too long or they became pretty corrupt and bu of the state wealth was transferred into hands of a few wealthy oligarchs who got rich because of their political connections Poland on the other hand it's always like that it's always like there's some rich people they getting power and then they they take away the money for themselves they corrupt it and they make it worse for everyone below but it doesn't seem like based on what he's saying it doesn't seem like that's what happened in Poland because you do hear about Russian oligarchs and Ukrainian oligarchs who own so much and have so much money um and they're basically in charge of the country but I feel like it happens everywhere you feel like that's in Poland as well surely come on man yeah but I but what I mean is is like if that is the case it doesn't seem like it's affected the economy of the country in itself where it has countries like Ukraine and it's interesting because I don't know I hear lots of different opinions right um about Poland in general like from this video it looks like Poland's doing amazing and stuff but when I'm listening to some people they they don't think it's doing that well so guys us know that's why that's why this video has some dislikes as well I mean people will disagree with the situation and they will say no well for me it's not like that but if you're yourself living where you are now and you ask your parents who moved away from from Poland surely they would look back now and they would go it's probably much better than it was true and manage this transition arguably better than others it transitioned to capitalism quickly but privatized most of the state-owned companies slowly and a few years later than most of its neighbors after the chaos calmed down and after it became a little bit harder to steal everything thanks to that it became pretty much the only post-communist country without an economy dominated by oligarchs and without an economic crash in the 1990s but despite the Good Start in the early 2000s this wasn't enough anymore in order to grow and so the next phase was about globalization in 2004 Poland joined the European Union and the open European market with a free movement of goods and services without any barriers between Poland and the rest of Europe it made sense for Western European companies to move their manufacturing over to Poland where they had a large and a very cheap pool of workers at their disposal and while these companies kept most of the profit Poland got enough out of it to keep growing at a pretty fast pace and joining the EU brought another major benefit since one of its ke principles is redistribution yeah sharing and stuff so if Poland was down here and every other country was up here you know it's going to balance itself out for Poland this was good yeah but you say but Greece for instance um went bankrupt and it brought like the Euro down as a whole for instance and stuff like that and even even though that even though they were sort of part of the EU um maybe it didn't work out for yeah I mean it doesn't work out for everyone but I think in Poland's case it's different because they joined for a reason to be able to join like globally and stuff I don't know the full history yeah of money from wealthier member states to the less developed ones in order to balance the wealth disparity across the union after joining the Eastern European states started to receive a lot of money and Poland managed to use them to build and improve everything from roads to universities and again in a lot more efficient way than in many other Eastern European I think for sure roads have improved since like when I was there even just recently I was actually making a joke to everyone cuz I was like with people in the car and I kept making a joke like oh there's a bridge being built over there and like I said it once right and then I just kept making it a joke like every time there was a bridge being built I was like there's another bridge and like it was just like at one point I was like how many bridges are being built in like roads and everything it was like that when we were in warsa there's so much building going on there's so much development yeah like and it was crazy I when I used used to drive to my grandma's house right um from my dad's side bcha yeah bap's house um he used to take me take us about 4 hours now it would take about 2 hours really so they've just made like I guess they made tunnels and bridges and blah blah blah to make it much easier yeah highways highways yeah countries but that can still only take you as far in many countries following a similar trajectory eventually fall into the so-called middle inome trap if your economy is based on providing cheap labor for foreign companies you can only grow to a certain level and if you can't offer anything else apart from that and you don't have any major companies of your own you're stuck but so far Poland seems to be avoiding that 15 years ago foreign companies were coming in to hire low-skilled and low paid workers for menial labor but today they're coming because Poland has one of the largest pools of engineering talent in Europe and instead of where bro I'm telling you so many of my cousin friends all engineers and developers software developers and I I didn't know that PO had such a big movement on that side like I didn't I haven't heard of any even the teeken Warsaw apparently is crazy though like um and there's well I don't know if there's a lot of jobs but I think so it sounds like it B based on this video but I mean he but he's going to tell us what's going to bring Poland down soon warehouses and basic factories companies like Google are opening search and development hubs now that said Poland is still relatively poor at least compared with most of Western Europe but the growth so far has been impressive and unusually inclusive average wages in the country massively increased while inequality remained low and so it's not a growth that would only exist on paper or only help select few but it actually trickled down to the rest of the society and there's one more area outside of economic growth where Poland has been getting a lot of attention lately and that's milary also just before we go into the military I just wanted to highlight like when I've recently been to Poland and the the people that I've spoke to I feel like I don't know even just looking at like how much they were able to like go out and buy like we was going to like restaurants yeah and I was thinking this is quite expensive whilst I was bringing pounds right um and these guys were like yeah we can go out like eat once a week in a nice restaurant like stuff like that and I'm thinking you know that that's a good sign right um and also like clothes wise and what what um what jobs they're performing and how much they're earning not everyone was telling me that but some of the closer friends and stuff yeah um there's definitely a difference there there definitely it felt like everyone was living fairly um okay but then but then but then you but then you can feel that here as well can't you you can feel that here but then you can you can go out down the street and see a homeless person or you can go and find people that aren't living well and stuff like that yeah it's it's obviously different based on different people and stuff um yeah but but but let's see what the military say it's unprecedented military buildup historically Poland has some good reasons to be a little paranoid Stu between Germany and Russia it has been invaded partitioned colonized and stripped of its independence time and time again and even though today it's in NATO this historical memory is still there and while most European countries were taking their peace dividends Poland has kept military funding at one of the highest levels in NATO and after the Russian invasion of Ukraine it went into an overdrive it announced that in just a few years it will increase its military spending to 5% of its GDP higher than any other NATO member double the size of its Armed Forces to 300,000 and buy thousands of Tanks fighter jets and other military equipment and before the end of the decade Poland plans to have the most powerful ground forces in Europe in what would be one of the most ambitious military buildups in modern European history now that being said what Poland has achieved so far is impressive and what it plans to achieve is that kov or g g SC I see this is the thing I've seen a street in kov that has a tunnel like this at the end no it's not like that though yeah I know what one you're talking about um no this is din we got a picture there as well is it what right here yeah yeah yeah damn I we need to go back to put in again even more so but it's yet to be seen if all that will actually happen despite its successes there are some significant risks that could kill the entire polish miracle and not everyone is so bullish on Poland's future for a long time demography has been considered the number one threat as around half a million people have left the country in the last 30 years but now it looks like Poland managed to reverse this trend in recent years it has seen a what was it this place that whiskey in a jaw I remember we had food at this place in GL but I don't know if it was this one or if they no it was it was next to the river right yeah yeah first brain drain as poles and people with Polish Heritage living abroad have started coming back to the country and since the country tooken over 1 and a half million Ukrainian refugees the demographic TRS are looking much better and so there are really two major risks first while the growth has been impressive Poland has not actually avoided the middle income trap completely so far it's still massively reliant on foreign investments and although tech centers are being opened in Warsaw they are set up by Foreign companies rather than by polish yeah I knew this so much of it so this is what what what it's saying is maybe is that Poland needs its own companies it needs its own spill like needs its own Googles and Samsungs and whatever's um built up but then how do you I feel like it's difficult in a market like that to be able to bring something in and have it dominate when you've got so many other massive companies that dominate everything else um I mean I'm I'm sure it come there are some there are some ones and while that brings jobs and growth once again there is a limit to how high you can grow since most of the profits will always end up leaving the country in the end in order to break into the big leagues you need your own domestic Giants in sectors with high eded value and Poland doesn't have that or at least not yet but the far bigger risk is of a completely different nature and it concerns a part of the Polish story that we haven't touched on yet the thing is that Poland is a deeply deeply divided country so much that we can almost talk about two different polands one liberal and Progressive and the other deeply conservative and religious like in the US the two that is I think that is a problem what a problem kind like the same as the American side of things where there are there are two there will always be two very different groups of people that that that want to see change you'll have the people that and I feel like you've had in con Poland's had this group of people who are you know so patriotic and and and they've been in power for so long now what if now what if a different government comes into Power based on younger people more liberal side of it who who want to see a lot of stuff legalized like you know like the LGBT side of things which isn't legal in Poland um you know that could cause a rift in in the way things like it does in America you got so many different group so staunch different views like I mean we saw it ourselves in G we walked through literally an LGBT protest with people in skull masks and and and other people waving the flags and stuff and police anti protest yeah like it was yeah and that I think that's that's one of Poland's thing if you look at it from the outside cool but yeah it is divided in terms of it people Civil War coming are finding it increasingly difficult to coexist together and surveys show that both sides are highly suspicious of each other intolerant to opposing views and increasingly refusing to compromise and for years the current conservative government has been criticized by the liberal opposition for supposedly bending the rule I mean obviously things are changing now as well with all the voting I'm not actually too sure as of today of what's Happening um I'm not really following it that much but things are changing um so we'll see if it's forther better but who knows yeah RS in order to stay in power and it has had a growing beef with the European Union that's threatening to cut Poland off from EU funds as a punishment for not upholding the rule of law and the thing is that whatever side you cheer for the end result is bad for both and for Poland in general the country needs both parts of the population to coexist and work together and it needs the EU if it wants to be truly successful and if it doesn't manage to do that the Polish Miracle will be over soon before it has really started damn he's he to be fair I think he made some good points in there I think he talked about some good stuff um thanks to explained with dom um obviously for this video and um yeah it's it was really good actually understanding what the different where it's come from what it's done and where it could go like some there's definitely some good like theories of how it could go and what what it need what Poland needs to do to to get to a to get to a good point basically um yeah good video um informative thoughts what do you think gonna happen I just well what do you want to happen what I want to happen is for Poland to keep growing obviously I mean that's that's crazy by 20 was it 2030 or 2060 2030 it could be a bigger economy than the UK like that's mad but then again our government here is just [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah I feel like Poland might be going up UK might be going down so yeah yeah it's it's it's a it's good it's great it's interesting though maybe I can go back one time maybe one day not one time get him out guys um anyway but yeah guys let us know what you think let us know what you think is going to happen your your theories what you think of Poland and where you think it's going to go just yeah let let us know in the comments um and if you want to see more videos like this uh just let us know as well leave some recommendations and thank you again to explained with dom for the video very good we'll link that in the yeah we'll link that in the description make sure to give him a like and and a subscribe and yeah what are you lying for what do you mean but from us also and we'll see you in the next one peace peace\",\n",
       " \"foreign [Music] [Music] good morning everyone we are on a\\nmountain trail going around Morskie Oko Lake leading us to another mountain lake called\\nCzarny Staw. Czarny Staw is on the way to the highest peak\\nof Poland called Rysy. It supposed to take us not longer than two\\nhours to get to that Lake, from there we will see how the weather will be maybe we will\\neven go to the top of Rysy and yeah pretty excited to see it, because it's the first\\ntime when I will be there it's hard to tell anything more, because it's not decided yet. We'll see what we'll do when we get there,\\nso see you later [Music] it took us around one hour to get the Chinese stuff from shelter\\nthe trail was very pleasant easy and then it was slightly stiff but I think that everybody\\ncan do that if you are at mosh keoko it's definitely worth to come here as both Lakes\\nare extremely beautiful and the views are just magical right now we're going over there\\nand we hope to see both Lakes from that point and to make some beautiful photos [Music]\\nso our goal for today was to get to the viewpoint on the way to Rysy. Rysy is the highest mountain peak in Poland\\nso it's a very popular trail and it's always busy there are many people so it's impossible\\nto be here alone it took us two hours to get here from the Schronisko Morskie Oko and the\\ntrail wasn't very challenging physically but if you're scared of heights it might be slightly\\ndifficult for you and scary, but believe me that the views are rewarding and it's totally\\nworth to come here. We spend a little bit of time here and now\\nwe're going down back to the shelter to have our breakfast [Music] thank you hey we're almost there and it's\\nCzarny Staw let's go [Music] it's 12:30 we just got down the mountain and\\nit's time for breakfast we bought ourselves very delicious traditional Polish food all\\nthe food here in the shelter it's below 10 euros but it's very delicious and despite\\nthat there are many people here they're cooking very fast we stay at the second floor On this floor we have four rooms.

       " \"Hello my dear friends thank you very much\\xa0\\nfor watching my channel again today we're\\xa0\\xa0 going to be talking about 10 things that\\xa0\\nshocked me in Poland so let's get into that. Shops are closed on Sundays. Don't think you can\\xa0\\njust go and buy something in the supermarket or\\xa0\\xa0 in a shop on Sundays because they are closed\\xa0\\nand this happens since 2018 when there was a\\xa0\\xa0 new law introduced which forbids shops to open\\xa0\\non Sundays and it was shocking for me because in\\xa0\\xa0 Guatemala I think Sunday is the most important\\xa0\\nday of the week for shops because people don't\\xa0\\xa0 usually work on this day so they have time to\\xa0\\ngo and buy, and in Poland there are only seven\\xa0\\xa0 Sundays during the year when the shops are open.\\xa0\\nYou don't want to go during those seven Sundays\\xa0\\xa0 because believe me they are packed, they are\\xa0\\nfull, they're so crowded, it's difficult to\\xa0\\xa0 find parking. Please let me know if in your\\xa0\\ncountry shops are open or closed on Sundays. Saturday is a day for cleaning. It\\xa0\\nis a tradition that families have,\\xa0\\xa0 that they deep clean the whole house, and it is\\xa0\\nfrom the youngest to the oldest, they all help\\xa0\\xa0 each other and they clean the whole house but\\xa0\\nit's a deep clean. In Guatemala there is not a\\xa0\\xa0 specific day for cleaning and I'm not saying that\\xa0\\npeople in Poland don't clean on different days,\\xa0\\xa0 I'm just saying that there is a tradition that\\xa0\\nI'm sure that a lot of families keep that on\\xa0\\xa0 Saturdays they clean, and that's something\\xa0\\nthat I have already got used to... on Saturday\\xa0\\xa0 mornings I usually deep clean the flat but\\xa0\\nat the beginning that was shocking for me People don't eat red meat on Fridays, and this\\xa0\\nis a tradition that is still kept nowadays,\\xa0\\xa0 I'm not saying that everyone does it, but\\xa0\\naccording to the Catholic Church Fridays are\\xa0\\xa0 of penitence so you shouldn't eat red meat, and I\\xa0\\nnoticed at least in Lubelskie and in Podkarpackie,\\xa0\\xa0 that a lot of people still follow this tradition\\xa0\\nand they don't eat red meat on Fridays,\\xa0\\xa0 instead they eat pierogi, or just spaghetti with\\xa0\\nsauce or pancakes, I don't know something else,\\xa0\\xa0 or fish and this was shocking for me because\\xa0\\nin Guatemala it doesn't happen. Guatemala is\\xa0\\xa0 a very Catholic country as well but this just\\xa0\\nhappens during Lent not during the whole year\\xa0\\xa0 and in Poland, they also don't eat red meat\\xa0\\non Christmas, and as I said I'm not saying\\xa0\\xa0 that it's everyone but I know that a lot of\\xa0\\npeople don't eat meat Fridays, please let me\\xa0\\xa0 know down in the comments if in your country\\xa0\\npeople do or do not eat red meat on Fridays The celebration of the name day. Yes, in Poland\\xa0\\npeople celebrate their name day or 'Imieniny' in\\xa0\\xa0 Polish and this is a celebration of the day of the\\xa0\\nsaint you're named after, but they don't celebrate\\xa0\\xa0 the Saints, they celebrate the name, and this is\\xa0\\na celebration that is mostly popular among older\\xa0\\xa0 people but it is still very strong, and people\\xa0\\ngather with their families and friends and they\\xa0\\xa0 eat, and they drink. In some cases it is possible\\xa0\\nto celebrate it in different times of the year\\xa0\\xa0 because the name is so popular that many Saints\\xa0\\nhad it that's why for example the name Maria,\\xa0\\xa0 I know that it is in different times of\\xa0\\nthe year that is possible to celebrate it,\\xa0\\xa0 and some people even decide to celebrate it\\xa0\\nmany times of the year because one time I\\xa0\\xa0 heard someone saying that Polish people like\\xa0\\ncelebrating for everything and the name day\\xa0\\xa0 is a great day for you to celebrate, and\\xa0\\ndrink, and eat with your family. Please\\xa0\\xa0 let me know if in your country people also\\xa0\\ncelebrate the name they like they do in Poland The darkness during the winter. In Poland it gets\\xa0\\ndark quite early during the winter and especially\\xa0\\xa0 during December it gets dark around 3 P.M and\\xa0\\nthat was completely shocking for me especially\\xa0\\xa0 because I'm from Guatemala, a country where\\xa0\\nit gets dark from 5 to 6 PM all year long and,\\xa0\\xa0 when I moved to Poland the winter was starting\\xa0\\nso it was one of the most difficult things for\\xa0\\xa0 me to get used to, and after three years it's\\xa0\\na bit better but I'm not gonna lie to you that\\xa0\\xa0 when it's 3 P.M and it gets dark... in my mind I\\xa0\\nhave that the day is over but it's not like that.\\xa0\\xa0 Please let me know in the comments at what time\\xa0\\nit gets dark in your country during the winter People take their shoes off when they visit\\xa0\\nsomeone. That is something strange for me because\\xa0\\xa0 in Guatemala I think I never removed my shoes when\\xa0\\nI entered someone's home, but in Poland every time\\xa0\\xa0 that you visit someone you're supposed to take\\xa0\\nyour shoes off before you enter the person's home,\\xa0\\xa0 and that is because the shoes contain bacteria\\xa0\\nfrom the outside and in some occasions it is\\xa0\\xa0 raining outside, and there is snow, so you\\xa0\\ndon't want to make a mess on the floor,\\xa0\\xa0 and people also have carpets and rugs,\\xa0\\nand you don't want to make them dirty,\\xa0\\xa0 so that's the reason why you should remove\\xa0\\nyour shoes when you enter someone's home and,\\xa0\\xa0 my recommendation would be if you're\\xa0\\nvisiting someone put on a good pair of socks. When you visit someone there is always a lot\\xa0\\nof food, one time even one person told me,\\xa0\\xa0 Jose my guests cannot leave my home if they\\xa0\\nare not full. And I think that is completely\\xa0\\xa0 true because when you visit someone, you're\\xa0\\ngoing to find salads, ham, cakes, sausages,\\xa0\\xa0 sandwiches, and many more things and,\\xa0\\nI think I don't know it's a it's a way\\xa0\\xa0 of Polish people making their guests feel\\xa0\\nwelcome, because they offer a lot of food,\\xa0\\xa0 and the food is delicious, and the host\\xa0\\nalways offers again, and over again,\\xa0\\xa0 and again, so believe me that when you visit\\xa0\\nsomeone you're going to leave this place full. In Poland studies are short. For you to\\xa0\\nget a master's degree you need five years,\\xa0\\xa0 of course the bachelor's degree is included in\\xa0\\nthat, and students graduate from high school\\xa0\\xa0 when they're 19 years old so if you continue\\xa0\\nstudying by the time you're 24 you're going to\\xa0\\xa0 have a master's degree. In Ukraine people graduate\\xa0\\nfrom high school when they're 17 years old,\\xa0\\xa0 and some of them decide to study in Poland so\\xa0\\nthat means that by the time they're 22 they\\xa0\\xa0 have a master's degree. On the other hand,\\xa0\\nin Guatemala you need five years for you to\\xa0\\xa0 get the bachelor's degree and two extra if you\\xa0\\nwant a master's degree and in some cases it's\\xa0\\xa0 even longer because of the bureaucracy at\\xa0\\nuniversities, which is awful. Please let me\\xa0\\xa0 know down in the comments how long it takes in\\xa0\\nyour country for you to get a master's degree The villages are so beautiful, the first time that I\\xa0\\nwas driving through a village I couldn't believe\\xa0\\xa0 what I was seeing, because in Guatemala sadly\\xa0\\nvillages are places where the living conditions\\xa0\\xa0 are not good in some cases there is not\\xa0\\neven electricity, there is no asphalt on\\xa0\\xa0 the streets and yes, in general, they are poor\\xa0\\nplaces and the living conditions are not good,\\xa0\\xa0 and that's something that is very sad for me,\\xa0\\nbut in Poland the villages are so beautiful and\\xa0\\xa0 sometimes people decide to move to the villages\\xa0\\nand they build a beautiful house with a beautiful\\xa0\\xa0 garden and a beautiful view. Please let me know in\\xa0\\nthe comments how the villages are in your country You always hear that Polish people drink a lot\\xa0\\nbut you don't really have an idea of how much\\xa0\\xa0 they drink until you go to a Polish wedding...\\xa0\\nyou see bottle after bottle after bottle of vodka\\xa0\\xa0 coming to the table and then you think: well they\\xa0\\nmix it and they prepare drinks, let me tell you:\\xa0\\xa0 they don't. They drink it straight, clean, in\\xa0\\nshots of 30 or 50 milliliters and, afterwards,\\xa0\\xa0 they might drink some water, some juice, some\\xa0\\nsoda, and they also have this beverage which is\\xa0\\xa0 called Bimber which is a homemade alcoholic\\xa0\\nbeverage which contains between 50 and 70\\xa0\\xa0 percent of alcohol and, yes, you guessed\\xa0\\nwell, they also drink it during weddings,\\xa0\\xa0 and they also drink the next day after the\\xa0\\nwedding...so a lot. It's just incredible for\\xa0\\xa0 me. Please let know down in the comments if\\xa0\\npeople also drink in your country a lot. And,\\xa0\\xa0 my dear friends, thank you very much for\\xa0\\nwatching, once again, please let me know\\xa0\\xa0 in the comments what things impress you or shock\\xa0\\nyou or are interesting of this beautiful country,\\xa0\\xa0 and make sure you hit the like button and you\\xa0\\nsubscribe and I'll see you on the next video.\",\n",

       " 'Welcome from Wrocław. I visitied Wrocław University of Technology, to take part in AKL STOL conference. I gave a speech on Etrich Taube pioneer airplane, you will see this speech in a moment. Most presentations were for people highly educated in aviation and studying it. There were also aviation corporations presenting their career opportunities. If you failed to graduate in technical university, try YouTube like I did. I admire students\\' inventions. This is the Aurora rocket, element of \"PWr in Space\" project. There were RC planes designed by AKL club, which compete in SAE Aero Design competition in the US. The \"regular\" category plane has to carry as heavy a payload in single bay as possible. One plane can compete only once. Even a successful plane has to be replaced by a new one the following year. The \"adcanced\" category calls for a plane tackling \"special\" mission. This craft is called \"PADA\". The large one carries PADA and water. Large plane (remote controlled) had to fly over a target, detect it and release PADA, which had to recognize the target and land on it. Than PADA was turned into a rover and carried water on the ground. Only Polish team had no problems releasing the PADA from the mother-plane. The target reach rate was 65%, and they were the only to succeed. Wrocław team has a stunning collection of trophies and is feared by the competitors each time. Mike Patey (Draco creator) signed students\\' plane. Polish students have little time to create their designs. Planes have to be shipped in February to reach USA by early summer. Local teams have few months more - this is significant. The shipping cost of planes alone is over $10 000, an enormous cost. I could see Wrocław from above for free. Students travel between university buildings in Polinka cable car. As a student I drove Toyota Celica GT-Four, and thought it was something... I thank all the channel supporters and patrons. Conference organizers recorded my speech, to show it to you. I have one more question (at the end). Watch my speech - Zabytki Nieba live! We have heard much about what is to come in aviation, let me now tell about what took place long ago. After the death of Otto Lilienthal Etrich family bought two of his gliders to develop them. Igo Etrich (1879-1956) lived in the era of progress. In 1879 a mild-steel oceanic ship was a novelty, in 1956 Lockheed Starfighter exceeded Mach 2. Etrich studied also biology. Javan Zanonia seed proved crucial. It looks like a palm tree, but is also described as kind of cucumber (?). The seed uses phugoidal oscillation to glide on great distances. Seed is heavy with lightweight wings. Maple seeds cover 5km, Zanonia flies much further, sometimes reaching ships far from coast. Etrich and Wels created a glider based on Zanonia seed. Later they tried 1908 Antoinette V8 motor, but this modification was a failure. Later Etrich continued developing seed-shaped wings, Wels went toward biplanes and craft with moving wings. Etrich added tailplane and created successful plane,  the Etrich Taube first flown in 1910 which resembled pigeon in flight. In 1910 plane was patented. License for production was sold to Rumpler company. But in 1910 something happened and patent protection was lifted. Probably the plane was claimed so good that (along with flag or anthem) it is a nationwide good, and should be widely available. By 1913 virtually any manufacturer would build some Taubes. About 50 (=90%) of German and Austrian airplane companies built Taube. They built great number of 500 planes. Records made Taube famous. These are record and pioneer flights. Taube carried first passenger over the English Channel. There was over 700km flight completed in one day. There was Berlin-Copenhagen direct oversea flight. Altitude records are described as between 6093 and 7200m. This postcard show Taube over Johanisthal airfield, with mountain range painted below. Taube flew over nearby Śnieżka mountain (1603m). Taube had traditional all-wooden fuselage with steel cable reinforcements. Covered in canvas with several metal parts around the engine and sometimes along the floor or top part of cockpit. Two-seat version quickly became a standard. Pilot was in the back, and controls were relatively modern, with yoke and rudder pedals. Front seat doubled as main fuel tank. Apart from license-built wooden version there was also Stahltaube with metal frame, built at least by Jeannin and DFW works. Closed cockpit version was proposed, either to protect the crew from elements while writing a report or as pioneer \"air taxi\". Here is the tailplane. Darker part was rigid, transparent part was made of bamboo and warped to act as elevator. Only the rudder was hinged. Two flag-shaped parts. This Taube in in Polish Aviation Museum in Kraków. It was built as an oldtimer in 1930\\'s hence the post WWI paint scheme. Landing gear was Bleriot\\'s patent with trailing swingarms. Rubber cables for shock-absorbing were tied to leading edge. Notice the hook acting as parking brake for engine trial. Some Taubes had wheels below wingtips and in the back instead of standard tailskid. There is also an era-specific skid in front to protect from damaging the propeller. Army required plane to take off from a field ploughtd single time. Stahltaubes had more modern gear. In case of landing gear damage it did not punch the radiator. Most Taubes had two radiators - one per side above the landing gear. ...floatplane... Wings clearle resemble the Zanonia seed. Distinctive shape. Airfoil was very thin, and not closed from the underside. This is the \"Bridge\". Wing had 2 standard spars, with third spar underneath. It was possible to make this into a folding wing, I read a description of it, but have never seen historic photo of folded wings. Bamboo wing segment used for warping. Many cables ran along the bridge and over the wing each wing was warped by about 10 cables. Taube was easy to fly, but required physical strength. There was a chain, cables, angles, pulleys - hard to move. This show the warping movement upward range. Some companies aliminated the bridge, fitted modern-style tailplane and hinged ailerons instead of warped wings. French dubbed the Taube \"invisible\" as trailing parts were covered on top side only, so when this 14m plane reached 400m it was hard to see and hear. In 1913 several crashed were caused by wings braking off. \"Klapptaube\" was a new nickname. Durability tests were performed. 3,42g made wooden Rumpler Taube disintegrate. For some reason Gotha Taubes were more durable, and only Stahltaubes withstood the test. Now new taubes were ordered by the army before the WWI. Only the ones already bought were in use. Engines: 4600-11000cc, 50-120HP, inline 4 or inline 6. One picture shows Taube with 7cylinder radial rotary engine, I guess it was the Gnome Omega 7. Taube had pressurized cooling system, with no coolant evaporation or loss. 16 litres of coolant for 6 cylinder version. THere was a gap between radiator and fuselage. In winter felt was squeezed there to limit cooling potential. Some ngines came fith radiator fitted in safe place above cylinder heads. Notice the small tank above the cockpit. Some planes have larger one, some have small spherical one or no tank at all. Take a look at this Albatros. Fuel pumps were not used back then. But tank was below the engine, so it needed pressurizing. Pneumatic pump behing engine generated pressure inside fuel tank pushing fuel to the engine. But to start the engine a small tank was used to make fuel go down to the engine upon cranking. This was what it is for, still some Taubes are pictured without this tank. In 1911 Italy was at war with Ottoman Empire, which had vast part of Northern African territory. THere was a batlle near Trypolis (today Libia). Italian pilot raided the Turks with Taube. Two 1,5kg grenades hit the target, two missed. Ottoman Empire claimed that Hague Convention was violated. It prohibited dropping explosives from balloons, airships and other inventions of similar nature. Is plane of the similar nature to the airship? This is Taube and Zeppelin. Turks were shot upon with 150 shells from warship few hours before, and had no problem with that. By 1914 Taube was obsolete. Still during the Battle of Tannenberg Taube observer helped by reporting unexpeted changes in Russian positions. Taubes dropped explosives and calls to surrender over Paris. But Chinese story stands out. There was a German colony Tsingtau, besieged by the Japanese. Gunther Plushow made one airworthy Taube out of two damaged ones with Chinese Oak airscrew which had to be reglued after each flight. He flew as reckon, delivered orgers, and escaped the siege in Taube, later crashed, and went through Japan, Hawaii, USA, Gibraltar and England to Germany. He was treated as spy, as such escape was considered impossible. Taube was \"armed\" only with handheld firearms. It was slow and not agile, many airmen shared such fate as shown, shot down by more modern planes. Taubes were withdrawn to training, and Ernst Udet, Max Immelmann and other future aces made their first flights in Taubes. There was a factory in Liebau, Austria (today: Lubawka, Poland). It is south-west from Wrocław, on Polish-Czech border. Etrich build factory there. Some buidlings may still exist. It was close to stadium and railroad. These fields were the runway. Few hindred meters from Polish-Czech border. Does this Taube fly over this modern landscape? Very likely. Etrich also built there: the Ertich VII monoplane, 4-seat Luftlimousine, and 1929 Sport Taube. It was faster than any Czechoslovakian fighter, so it was impounded due to risk of isung it for smuggling. This made Etrich withdraw and go back to making textile industry machines. Factory was no longer functional (as Etrich),  but in 1948-51 70 \"Lub-1 ABC\" gliders were built there. Then facility turned to a lumber mill. Taube was iconic. German book of the era divides planes into: Doppledecker (biplanees), Eindecker (monoplanes) and Tauben - the latter is not a type, but airframe configuration standard. I wish all students to make something that will be shown on stamps, coins, commercials, may all licensing laws be abided. If your today\\'s invention be as memorable as Taube, it will be covered during 2137 AKL Conference. Thank you. - Thank you, please remain for a moment, Kacper Adolf, chairman of our club will hand a gift. I was given a model of \"advanced\" plane. Made by designers of the original in the same workshop. Very valuable piece for my collection. Thaks to Wrocław University of Technology new films are to come. It will take more than one visit there to cover the topic and meet people involved, I do my best to create as good a content I can. One more question. I am searching for 1918-1939 Polish touring planes. RWD-4, RWD-5, RWD-9, RWD-13. but also twin-engined like RWD-11. Or planes of Polish airlines: older Junkers, Lockheed Electra, PZL Wicher? Models have to be large, over 1m span, so rather RC models. No need for extra detailing. If you have such model, write me, there is a chance to show it to many people interested (but not on my channel). Come visit Polish Aviation Museum in Kraków and meet me, and see you in future episodes. Bye!',\n",

comedy\\xa0\\xa0 sketch uh part of a show where it's a bit\\xa0\\nof satire that talks about real life and\\xa0\\xa0 learning about history as well um so let's\\xa0\\nsee what they have for us today in race ists if someone has to say no I'm not\\xa0\\nracist uh they normally have racist tendencies for Fore spee for speee what is going on here why are guns involved hang on excellent subtitles uh my\\xa0\\nancestors was zisha the black legendary polish\\xa0\\xa0 Knight who fought against the Tuton tonic order\\xa0\\num so I'm pretty sure that basically Z zavisa\\xa0\\xa0 the black was actually black if I remember\\xa0\\nrightly if i' I've done a tiny little bit of\\xa0\\xa0 research I think this certainly plays up\\xa0\\nto the stereotypes people have of Poland\\xa0\\xa0 and some stereotypes are true maybe there's\\xa0\\nless tolerance of of other races you know\\xa0\\xa0 um I think that's a key issue that's coming\\xa0\\nout here and it is satire at the end of the day for and that's straight away going back\\xa0\\nto the whole thing of it does seem look I\\xa0\\xa0 know like polls suffered from the Germans but\\xa0\\neverything always seems to go back to either\\xa0\\xa0 the Germans or the Russians even if like in\\xa0\\nthis example there nothing to do with the\\xa0\\xa0 Germans and nothing to do with the Russians\\xa0\\nbut to be fair polls do like to have a go at\\xa0\\xa0 the Germans and Russians for for for rightful\\xa0\\nreasons obviously but it's not always their fault what do you think you're doing you\\xa0\\nblack magic fatherfucker didn't even use word don't bring us British in it we haven't done\\xa0\\nanything this time now blaming us for the Titanic\\xa0\\xa0 honestly uh it's this spot on though isn't it it's\\xa0\\nspot on like it's not about offending anyone it\\xa0\\xa0 that's a SAT that's satire for you but it's you\\xa0\\nknow it's talking about you know the intolerances\\xa0\\xa0 that that some polls have um it's talking\\xa0\\nabout how how you know the Germans the Russians\\xa0\\xa0 the Brits get blamed for things even if it's\\xa0\\nnothing to do with them it's got some truth in it we're even having a shot at women now\\xa0\\nhonestly women are in like I I don't look\\xa0\\xa0 I know I know there was a female King many many\\xa0\\nyears ago but I I think within the whip side of\\xa0\\xa0 women you can see when women feel like they've\\xa0\\nbeen oppressed and and and pushed down and now\\xa0\\xa0 women are getting the power that's why you\\xa0\\nsee like for example in the summer all the\\xa0\\xa0 women with without any bras on because it\\xa0\\nstarts as a statement it then became just\\xa0\\xa0 the norm um you know in V all the young girls\\xa0\\nyoung women should I say um without bras on\\xa0\\xa0 and things because it's another thing it's not\\xa0\\njust a stereotype that women have been oppressed\\xa0\\xa0 they they have and now they are fighting\\xa0\\nand and and breaking away and and becoming equals oh fore fore foree for she is a very hot woman that was fantastic like I said it's it's a\\xa0\\nthat is a really really good Sati and and they've\\xa0\\xa0 done plenty of these obviously the the first one\\xa0\\nI watched was was about Hitler I love the the guy\\xa0\\xa0 that is um very extrovert very Camp very likes\\xa0\\nto flow and move um but this is this is clearly\\xa0\\xa0 picking up on things that are true to life that's\\xa0\\nwhat satire is it doesn't matter um it does when\\xa0\\xa0 it comes to satire it doesn't matter who it's\\xa0\\nlike political satti it doesn't matter who's in\\xa0\\xa0 charge you find comedy from the the realities and\\xa0\\nI and I you know I think there is a lot of Truth\\xa0\\xa0 in this like I said about women being oppressed\\xa0\\nand and you know the whole thing of I don't know\\xa0\\xa0 if I you know in the time that I've been to Poland\\xa0\\nwhat the five visits I've been on I don't recall\\xa0\\xa0 any black people well that's not necessarily a\\xa0\\nproblem maybe black people don't want to come\\xa0\\xa0 to Poland I don't know um but I think Poland's\\xa0\\nnot seen as a multi-racial country and I think\\xa0\\xa0 that's probably true um there's there's a lot of\\xa0\\nthings in here that they get spot on they get spot\\xa0\\xa0 on and sometimes things are stereotypes sometimes\\xa0\\nthere is some truth in them and I think they did\\xa0\\xa0 this really well and I think they do the the this\\xa0\\nreally really well where they make a joke of it\\xa0\\xa0 because sometimes when things aren't great it's\\xa0\\ngood to joke about them and make light of them\\xa0\\xa0 because it then it softens it a little little\\xa0\\nbit it's it's it doesn't make things as bad as\\xa0\\xa0 they no that's not right I don't mean they don't\\xa0\\nmake it as bad as they are um in terms of what\\xa0\\xa0 you know the actual issues are but it it makes\\xa0\\nit less of an issue I think less yeah less of an\\xa0\\xa0 issue it on the on the progression side of things\\xa0\\nso I've I thought that was absolutely fantastic a\\xa0\\xa0 really really good episode thank you so much

       " \"US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Friday\\nthat the U.S. will sell 250 M1A2 Abrams tanks to Poland, giving a key NATO ally that borders\\nRussia a significant boost in firepower. Austin was in Warsaw for talks with Polish\\nofficials about Russia’s military buildup around Ukraine. He noted that adding the tanks to the Polish\\narsenal will ensure more equitable security burden-sharing in NATO. As of now, no delivery timeline has been set. SEPv3 is the latest and most potent variant\\nof the M1A2 Abrams Main Battle Tank. In this video Defense Updates analyzes how\\nthe U.S plans to strengthen NATO's eastern flank with sales of M1A2 Abrams SEPv3 tanks\\nto Poland? Let's get into the details. Viewers may note that Russian actions have\\nmade the US and NATO extremely apprehensive. In January last year, the Polish military\\nconducted a massive simulated wargame against Russia's Western Military District named Winter-20. While the intricate details are classified,\\nthe outcome was demoralizing for Poland. As per reports, Poland was not able to defend\\nagainst the Russian assault for more than 5 days. Earlier several prominent members of Congress\\nare asking the US Defense Department to fast-track the sale and delivery. Citing the Russian build-up near Ukraine,\\nRepresentatives Mike Rogers (R-AL), ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee;\\nMike Turner (R-OH), ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence;\\nand Lisa McClain (R-MI), a member of the House Committee on Armed Services, had urged Secretary\\nof Defense Lloyd Austin to accelerate the transfer. Abram was first introduced in 1980 to replace\\nthe M60 main battle tank which was introduced in 1960. It was significantly more potent than the\\nM60 and featured many top-of-the-line components like a fire control system that allowed up\\nto 90% accuracy at ranges of 2,000 meters. The tank was technologically well ahead of\\nmost other tanks of its era. The U.S military has kept on upgrading the\\ntank to maintain its edge. For example, in 1986, the tank received a\\nmore powerful 120 mm German-engineered main gun and in 1988 it got a layer of depleted\\nuranium armor to increase protection. These upgrades were provided to Abrams so\\nthat it could dominate the Soviet tanks and repeal any armored thrust. This helped Abrams tanks roll over enemy tanks\\nin Afghanistan and Iraq. Abrams was designed so that it could accommodate\\nnew enhancements. This kind of forward-thinking has enabled\\nit to absorb new technologies. The M1A2 Abrams SEPv3 has added several features. Here is a brief overview: 1. It now includes an Ammunition DataLink. With this, the tank crew can set a distance\\nat which a shell will explode. So, if a building is targeted then the shell\\nwill explode inside the building instead of exploding after it has flown through it. This will enhance the precision of the hit\\n- destruction will be inflicted at the correct place and limit unintended damage. 2. M1A2 SEPv3 has added a better-infrared sight. Infrared sights basically enhance the night\\nfighting ability and with this improvement, the new variant will be better equipped for\\ntwilight missions. 3. The remotely-operated .50 caliber machine\\ngun will now be positioned at a comparatively lower height enabling better targeting position. 4. M1A2 SEPv3 has an auxiliary power unit (APU). This will allow the tank to keep running communications\\nand sensors and maintain battlefield awareness without having to use its powerful 1,500 horsepower\\ngas turbine engine. The engine is known to uses a lot of fuel\\nand is also a target for infrared homing weapons. 5. It also adds passive armor which will improve\\nthe tank's ability to survive when hit with the latest anti-tank weapons. 6. New explosive reactive armor (ERA) packages,\\nknown as the Abrams Reactive Armor Tile (ARAT) is deployed. ERA basically works by placing “tiles”\\nthat have explosives. When an incoming projectile hits them, they\\nexplode outward & explosive power of the projectile is deflected. These tiles are fitted on specific portions\\nof a tank. 7. The most important upgrade will certainly\\nbe the addition of the Trophy Active Protection System (APS). Israeli-made Trophy will be fitted on the\\nside of M1A2 SEPv3. Active or 'hard kill’ protection systems\\nconsist of sensors that are capable of detecting and tracking incoming anti-tank projectiles. After that, the targeted tank launches an\\ninterceptor projectile to shoot the incoming round. This is different from the 'soft kill’ approach\\nwhich involves jamming the projectile’s guidance or confusing them. In 2017, Colonel Glenn Dean a project manager\\nat the Army’s Redstone Arsenal had told Military.com that he “tried to kill the\\nAbrams tank 48 times and failed.” Russia operates as many as 12,000 tanks but\\na good percentage of them are older tanks and many of the newer T-90s have not been\\nupdated to the latest standards. In certain scenarios, numerically inferior\\nbut more capable tanks with longer range & better sensors can defeat or halt the progress of\\na much larger enemy tank force. This is especially true when these are deployed\\nin defensive formations. Poland’s defense minister Mariusz Błaszczak\\nhad earlier stated regarding the M1A2 Abrams SEPv3 deal, “So we are ordering the most\\nmodern tanks. Tanks available in the best-equipped version,\\ntanks that are combat-proven, tanks which were constructed to counter the most modern\\nRussian T-14 Armata tanks” T-14 Armata tanks are currently available\\nin very low numbers though the availability could increase in the coming days. It is evident that 250 M1A2 Abrams tanks will\\nbe a major force enhancer for Poland.\",\n",

Let's go, last meal, last meal and we'll report back . how does it taste and what does the in and out burger look like Damn, time has flown quickly Oh, there will be one more in the end there will be one more Homeless people in the video oh look, we found it, we finally found the districts There are some tents Hello Listen, today I will show you here the in and out burger founded in 1948 in the United States, we are in a great place because planes fly over this place and let's see what good things they have here, what kind of burger you can eat here, there is a very long queue for the Drive In, that stretches all the way down the street, but look what the menu is, they have basically four types, three types of burgers and fries plus drinks and three sets also a very simple menu s any gadgets what can be found in these burgers because I already know that the change will be stopped Polish theme thick thick Polish theme we have good for this We ordered we got a number I got two cups because they are available for sets, you can, I've already seen that lemonade is good, I think he once had such a menu, oh well, I'll add lemon to that for cola. McDonald's also had such a simple menu before he started making a million different kinds of crap. Okay, I've got a lemon here . there is still a place where you can get ketchup and peppers, but the peppers are not good, I praised the peppers, but you have to come soon, peppers, because the peppers are super spicy, but delicious planes are flying . 33 I guess too many of these chilies were lost, because I got so many in the box, the one we had yesterday, we could have had them. put on There is also one here, now the queue has decreased, but there is a whole street there, there was a queue there, a guy takes orders here, it's a very simple menu, here, the mill, where we were yesterday, it was the same, non-stop grinding, Okay, ours, this one, our order, such sets Janek, come on jio Okay, let's sit Look here at this one Look at this piece of onion I ch and midor and midor this But here's your tomato, here's your double tomato, instead of the onion I ordered it and I have a double onion We also have it but jaid but I won't give you mine all the time here are the orders, I beat my burger, I wanted to show you the peppers, which are very nice, spicy , I can recommend these burgers, they are definitely better than McDonald's, great. This is also the place. Planes are flying all the time, kids were fighting here for the chair, who should sit where, for the next one. See the plane. now there's one flying at us, there's one taking off Well, here it's normally non-stop take-off and landing, this one's flying a little low, look Janio, oh mother, come on Janek, let's run away, we'll return the car, I made it, it's cool, this application uploads photos here, my friend Emanuel has an add-on, he has two other cars, there's everything. ok here they are foldable The seats are also positive I hope there will be nothing more there later I will tell you about the prices nothing happened so it's finished we have all the suitcases now we have to rent a stroller for 8 dollars That's it and we're moving on what our stroller looks like on the way back, not a lot of pain for one stroller, big airport, big musts OB We're going to leave our luggage somewhere, it's somewhere in Warsaw, it's 10550 Okay, and here are the gates A53 A60 A53 A60 here we have C so we're going that way, this rental has ended, I'll tell you that this is a great deal I highly recommend this application no one pays me for it but they are great I don't know half the price I guess rental cars you can rent a car here for 40-50 dollars a day everything you put in the application photos make an appointment with the owner he is here he came to pick us up, now he left us because we were writing to each other in the chat, we also leave photos and everything is a problem. There's nothing to be afraid of, okay, and we're looking for ours here, there's bi in the end, it'll probably be there And there was such a big queue at the back, but luckily it wasn't for us, some Filipino airlines to the Philippines, so many people come here, they fly to the States, and we are looking for ours, there is A1, there will be a flight, I don't think there is a queue for the backdrop, we'll see what it will look like in the United States. Listen. 23 perfectly balanced by weight Ideal 230 our luggage is 230 d max loaded But look how nice we have this one, let's get rid of this luggage, only the seats will be loose, good we had stretch and raider tape with us, it's ready, there's a little more here, it's the wrong one, but he chose it for roof Oh mother, what happened, dad left the coffee on the roof Listen, we left, we knew at 10 p.m. The children fell asleep right after take-off, yes, and it's 1937. No, wait, we got up TR hours ago because it was 7:00 on the plane in the morning, we got off the plane and suddenly it's 7:00 p.m. instead of instead of 10:00 and 3 hours Now we're still on our way to Wrocław Well, I wonder if we'll go to sleep, well, that's cool, because we met some viewers on the plane Best regards, where will I leave it? Okay, let's go because we're in my home, hold on until soon, I'm sure Marianka and Welcome, they've teleported . here to me, to the barn, to my shop, the end of the good, the end, the end of the trip, the end of November and the end of the United States, yes, we came back in May, because if anyone hasn't seen it, the trip lasted almost 27 days, April, May at the turn, well, it's a revelation, it's nice to watch, it's nice to remember, but the last one the episode now, just a summary, one day we will finally be able to record it Well, maybe now, because we are flying out, we are flying out tomorrow, maybe we will record the podcast there, we will be able to do it, you know, maybe we will rest. Take a piece of paper, just in case, I have already taken a piece of paper with the expenses, but anyway, if you have it, Do you have any questions if you're watching and I don't know, are you planning a trip to the United States and you have, because now I, for example, if we're planning this trip, where are we going now, I also found videos, I found a YouTuber, I asked him, he replied to me and somehow it's like this, we already know something. We already know something. yes, because it's usually like that, when you come back, you're smarter no, so it's worth getting there in advance, especially since we also like to get a little more information so that we know exactly what to expect and we'll get something out of it, so it's nice to have this information they are there somewhere not to make any mistakes that can be avoided earlier Well, what's already in the episode, it's already Mainly there, yes, it was the burgers I liked the thick slice of onion, very important Well, there was onion, it's almost like home, because earlier, actually we haven't eaten any burgers, no, it's been a month, no. We went to McDonald's once, but we went to McDonald's to check the difference between Polish and American, and well, McDonald's is not good anywhere, it's just like that, you know, McDonald's is McDonald's, and we didn't find it here. really, these burgers were very, very nice, and then, what later, we just didn't have the strength, so you know, we have to film everything already, because what does the flight look like, this is the first episode, so to Stan Here, I use a camera, especially since there actually, we slept mostly on the flight, but he was there for the night and in this direction we slept, I was the best one, funny because I was sleeping, the kids were sleeping on the seats upstairs, and I miraculously squeezed in here, into the gap between the seats, and I was sleeping on the ground on the floor, and then I couldn't get out you stayed there, could you make a report from the floor, friend Grzesiu, I see that it's behind the grove there, hello, hello, it's creeping in, we're recording here, we're recording a summary of the distance, so this flight is fast, fast, bad, and the return flight, that's not the case at all, because it's at night we didn't even give here because there were a million meals as usual on the plane, we probably couldn't eat them all because the children were sleeping and we were sleeping And here And everyone gets Whether child or not child, they get a full portion and they just woke us up and here you are again Oh my God this there are already pull-out tables to fill with this food, so here's a piece of advice if you've just watched that one, don't take any of your food on the plane, because if you're on a flight, not if you're on a flight, well, I don't know, but now I was looking at 2,800 under 3,000, so don't worry. you can go both ways like this organize a flight to some different place now the flight has a lot of these many different destinations I looked in the United States We will probably slowly plan because I already see Yesterday was Wednesday again I didn't look and it's cheap Wednesday we check the tickets and it's already one Wednesday in a row maybe when we go away we'll see on for sure, but we were definitely captivated by the states and we will definitely go back there. Not every year, yet, a series from the states. No, now I've recorded as much as I have. We won't be recording that much anymore, and we won't be going back for that long. Well, not this one, but it was nice. to get back home, we managed to get there somehow Well, we already miss home because we know, cool, cool, cool, and not everything. That's it. We're packing today, so I don't know yet, we'll see Grzegorz while waiting, we'll record him sitting in his shelter somewhere. please leave it for the brushes, and in the meantime, if I do n't finish anything, we'll say goodbye. Thanks, and if not, there will be 10 greetings, there will be 10 greetings, but at this point, please, if you've been here once or maybe you liked something there, you want to stay longer, leave it. leave a subscription , write a comment, maybe if you have any questions, I will be happy to reply. Bye, take care. Hey, okay, I'm back for a moment. I would like to remind you that there are prizes waiting for you for subscriptions. First , there will be a small motorbike for PLN 30,000, then Comos, there is a plan for PLN 500,000. Enjoy. I'll light it up because we were supposed to start the Road King Zaz, we'll see about the pump-and-pump transfer. I don't know if there's fuel, but there's no fuel.

I was about to do a lasso, some kind of competition, something, I don't know, maybe someone wants to buy an original lasso from the United States, what if we had a show, a show, or a competition in Łeba, but there's so much going on in Łeba? that it's hard to take it somewhere next year, I had a video on how to throw such a lasso, God, I'm tired.

       " \"Ta Dahh! here we go The Poland Experience episode\\xa0\\nnumber two with an old old friend of mine bianca\\xa0\\xa0 from brazil if you don't know our backstory we met\\xa0\\nin what was it 2000 and 2009 2009 we both worked\\xa0\\xa0 for ringling brothers in barnum valley circus many\\xa0\\nmany many years ago it's like another life yeah so\\xa0\\xa0 i was shocked when i put that facebook post out\\xa0\\nand i said oh you know oliver being that you know\\xa0\\xa0 you know welcome to the world oliver lombardo and\\xa0\\nyou're like oh you're in poland it's like yeah\\xa0\\xa0 yeah i'm living in poland oh me too it's like what\\xa0\\ndo you mean you're in poland yeah so we're going\\xa0\\xa0 to start with how did you out of you know all\\xa0\\nthe travels and things are going on in your life\\xa0\\xa0 how did you get to poland we would have to go back\\xa0\\nlike about six years ago i was planning a trip to\\xa0\\xa0 india so i went to india for about three months to\\xa0\\nstudy yoga and there i met lots of polish people\\xa0\\xa0 and i really enjoyed their vibe and everything and\\xa0\\nof course i kind of felt in love with a guy there\\xa0\\xa0 but nothing very serious so um i went through\\xa0\\nlots of personal changes in my life related to\\xa0\\xa0 my previous relationship so i was living in states\\xa0\\nback then and yeah after one month i changed\\xa0\\xa0 everything i i packed my bags and i just decided\\xa0\\nto come to poland to meet him mateos my my husband i was not planning to settle down here i just like\\xa0\\nyou know i'm just gonna go there for a few months\\xa0\\xa0 and see how it's gonna go that's how it always\\xa0\\nhappens that's how it that's how it usually is\\xa0\\xa0 like oh i'm just gonna go try it for a couple\\xa0\\nmonths or i'm gonna take a trip and then you you\\xa0\\xa0 never go back to where you were going to yeah\\xa0\\ni was like summer or beginning of summer and\\xa0\\xa0 yeah i came but i was i think i was kind of\\xa0\\nready because i came with lots of bags anyway\\xa0\\xa0 and yeah i just stayed yeah i just stayed\\xa0\\nand yeah that was the beginning of the story\\xa0\\xa0 so you didn't love me so you hadn't visited\\xa0\\npoland before i never even heard much about\\xa0\\xa0 poland before in my life i didn't even know much\\xa0\\nabout you know anything about poland really yeah\\xa0\\xa0 at all at all i was like kind of googling before\\xa0\\nto try to know more a little bit about the history\\xa0\\xa0 or what is in the map or which borders with each\\xa0\\ncountry is like it was really like i didn't know\\xa0\\xa0 much at all and you just said i met this guy i'm\\xa0\\ngonna you know i'm in a terrible situation back\\xa0\\xa0 over here where i'm at i need to get out of\\xa0\\nthis thing i'm packing my bags and i'm going\\xa0\\xa0 to this country yeah yeah i mean i had to like\\xa0\\nyou know i i didn't feel living estates anymore\\xa0\\xa0 when i was back in states and i had a different\\xa0\\noptions to go to different countries for work and\\xa0\\xa0 and other things but i felt coming here and i felt\\xa0\\nmeeting him so i was like you know i'm gonna give\\xa0\\xa0 a try so i came and i don't regret it at all zero\\xa0\\nregrets coming regrets yeah like how hot how easy\\xa0\\xa0 or hard was the immigration process it's very hard\\xa0\\nvery very hard i just stopped dealing with them\\xa0\\xa0 like this month for example and i'm married since\\xa0\\n2016. yeah it was like such a big and long process\\xa0\\xa0 wow yeah five years yeah i just got my permanent\\xa0\\nresident status which is like after five years\\xa0\\xa0 so long that's incredible yeah i don't know if\\xa0\\nit's um uh because i'm i'm brazilian i i you know\\xa0\\xa0 most of the times when we need to resolve some\\xa0\\nsituation or fill up new papers that will join\\xa0\\xa0 is my husband doing and dealing and talking to\\xa0\\nthem in polish so i am kind of not really into\\xa0\\xa0 what is going on or why things are like this\\xa0\\nbecause he's taking care of all those things\\xa0\\xa0 very often but i just know it's take a long time\\xa0\\nit's just like five years i can't imagine i i\\xa0\\xa0 had to wait a year and about a year and a half\\xa0\\nfor my temporary residence call yeah mine too\\xa0\\xa0 but for the permanent one it took me that long\\xa0\\nfive years yeah so what was what's the biggest\\xa0\\xa0 difficulty besides everything has to be\\xa0\\nin polish um i think it's just like time\\xa0\\xa0 for me i think it's like a rule in my case\\xa0\\nthat is only after five years to get the\\xa0\\xa0 permanent residence that's just that's a policy\\xa0\\nyeah you have to be here for that amount of time\\xa0\\xa0 before you're granted that yeah did you have to\\xa0\\nlearn polish no i have to learn polish if i if\\xa0\\xa0 i think it's after seven years or after 10\\xa0\\nyears that if i want to apply to have like\\xa0\\xa0 a citizenship for example to have the passport\\xa0\\nthen i will have to learn polish and do like a\\xa0\\xa0 proper exam and things like that yeah\\xa0\\nman i know it takes such a long time\\xa0\\xa0 it really does yeah even for simple stuff i'm\\xa0\\nsaying why does this why does it take so long all\\xa0\\xa0 the papers why can't this be electronic and was it\\xa0\\nlike we had a very very funny um situation when i\\xa0\\xa0 was pregnant and we were trying to accelerate\\xa0\\nthe process to get the papers to get married\\xa0\\xa0 and because i was pregnant so we went to ujan\\xa0\\nand we tried to talk to them and they're like\\xa0\\xa0 no we cannot accelerate and we don't even know if\\xa0\\nthe baby is is your baby if he's a polish baby and\\xa0\\xa0 you're like whoa okay that's hysterical yeah can't\\xa0\\naccelerate this process yeah no i i think i think\\xa0\\xa0 we tried the same thing and we one of my friends\\xa0\\nhas a contact in uh or shot and it's like no\\xa0\\xa0 no you gotta wait your turn it seems that\\xa0\\neverything is very very very slow get your\\xa0\\xa0 patients together people and complicated\\xa0\\nso how different is the immigration process\\xa0\\xa0 from brazil to poland like i think it was a huge\\xa0\\ndifference is it quicker easier much quicker you\\xa0\\xa0 know after you have your marriage certificate\\xa0\\nyou just you know apply in the consulate for the\\xa0\\xa0 passport and you know and that's it you don't\\xa0\\nneed to do a portuguese test or anything like that\\xa0\\xa0 no portuguese test no did you hire a firm to\\xa0\\nhelp you with all your documents or did you\\xa0\\xa0 no no no no my husband he did everything yeah\\xa0\\nyeah everything even the interview as you go\\xa0\\xa0 for an interview yeah yeah yeah i went for\\xa0\\nan interview um just this month when i went\\xa0\\xa0 to get the the permanent uh status and i had\\xa0\\nto go with a friend so he couldn't help you\\xa0\\xa0 in that interview no he cannot be in the same\\xa0\\nroom because they're kind of making questions\\xa0\\xa0 to me and then they kind of make the same\\xa0\\nquestions to him and see if the answers they match\\xa0\\xa0 like where do you put to the vacuum cleaner in\\xa0\\nyour house seriously yeah that's a question yeah oh well yeah what we're gonna do who goes to the\\xa0\\ngrocery shop uh shopping uh more often and things\\xa0\\xa0 like that serious questions here security\\xa0\\nis really tight seriously they don't want\\xa0\\xa0 people putting their vacuum cleaner into different\\xa0\\nplaces in this country not here yeah not here\\xa0\\xa0 not allowed no so yeah for the interview\\xa0\\ni had i felt like i could have made it\\xa0\\xa0 through my interview for my for my karto pabetsu\\xa0\\nbecause the woman spoke english you're told like\\xa0\\xa0 no one's going to speak english but you're alone\\xa0\\ni wasn't alone i brought a friend too but i feel\\xa0\\xa0 we were waiting for this person to come and\\xa0\\nshe was saying why do you need it you don't\\xa0\\xa0 need to you don't need a person you know to\\xa0\\nhelp you i'm like i don't know if you speak\\xa0\\xa0 english like we were told everyone says get a\\xa0\\nperson yeah right hire someone and the prices\\xa0\\xa0 are rather expensive to hire someone to help you\\xa0\\nwith translation yeah man yeah so yeah that was\\xa0\\xa0 i had the impression that she did uh you know she\\xa0\\ncould understand everything that i would respond\\xa0\\xa0 to my friend in english but she was just with\\xa0\\nthe poker face and kind of like pretending that\\xa0\\xa0 she just the polish poker face i love that that's\\xa0\\none of my favorite things here like how you doing\\xa0\\xa0 good to see you no yeah yeah yeah there are some\\xa0\\npeople like our nate we are very lucky to have\\xa0\\xa0 a neighbor that they are very friendly and we\\xa0\\nhang out together all the time but usually i\\xa0\\xa0 think most of the people they are very serious\\xa0\\nabout like interacting super yeah that's a huge\\xa0\\xa0 if we really go back to that question so that's a\\xa0\\nbig thing i have like friends that sometimes they\\xa0\\xa0 come to poland to visit or whatever and they're\\xa0\\nlike why poland people don't smile like they\\xa0\\xa0 think like they they are sad all the time it's\\xa0\\nlike you know they're just you know very serious\\xa0\\xa0 how do you think the government could make this\\xa0\\nbetter how could the government improve efficiency\\xa0\\xa0 or what's one of the things the time limit for\\xa0\\nyou to get the permanent residence that's the\\xa0\\xa0 time limit that's that's just what it is but like\\xa0\\nmeanwhile i would say you know how to make the\\xa0\\xa0 process a little smoother yeah i think just a bit\\xa0\\nquicker and you know less papers less things and\\xa0\\xa0 you know like when they feel like there is a\\xa0\\ncouple already with a baby and their marriage\\xa0\\xa0 like why complicate things for so long you know\\xa0\\nwhat i mean it's like you know it just makes sense\\xa0\\xa0 it's a you know it's a new family you know give\\xa0\\nyou know the the status of a resident and so i\\xa0\\xa0 can travel with our problems and things like\\xa0\\nthat it's just like in brazil it's like that\\xa0\\xa0 if you prove you're married you have a family\\xa0\\nit's like oh okay fine come on in settle down\\xa0\\xa0 yeah maybe because he is very um they don't\\xa0\\nwant so many foreigners here like i don't know\\xa0\\xa0 you hear that you definitely hear that about\\xa0\\nyou know poland not taking certain refugees or\\xa0\\xa0 migrants and and you know limiting the\\xa0\\nnumbers you know which i mean it's their\\xa0\\xa0 country they have the right to do that\\xa0\\ni feel but i also feel that you could\\xa0\\xa0 you could make things easier digitally right you\\xa0\\ndon't need to go to the line and stay for hours\\xa0\\xa0 to just drop off documents yeah right i had\\xa0\\nto wait you're waiting three hours to go hand\\xa0\\xa0 in a piece of paper yeah like come on you\\xa0\\nknow just there's got to be a way that you\\xa0\\xa0 can log into a portal upload a document and it's\\xa0\\nofficial it's safe and away you go yeah definitely\\xa0\\xa0 yeah i know that i had two tries of with the\\xa0\\ncard simple better the first one uh we waited\\xa0\\xa0 a long time like you were saying the second\\xa0\\ntime around i was working with the foundation\\xa0\\xa0 that i'm employed through and they were\\xa0\\nlike just go to window whatever it is 7b\\xa0\\xa0 and i'm like 7b what do you mean just go to\\xa0\\nwindows 7b just go grab a number maybe five\\xa0\\xa0 minutes you'll wait drop your documents off and\\xa0\\naway you go i'm like is this gonna get the right\\xa0\\xa0 person yeah yeah it will no problem just go drop\\xa0\\nyour documents off sure enough roll up together\\xa0\\xa0 and cut the pizza find whatever that's not the\\xa0\\nreal number 7b i'm just making this up for the\\xa0\\xa0 story and drop them in pick the number drop them\\xa0\\noff no problem yeah so just a little tip for you\\xa0\\xa0 you don't always have to wait in line next time\\xa0\\nyou want to do this process okay in the next five\\xa0\\xa0 years whatever but yeah there's definitely one\\xa0\\nyou can go and just drop drop stuff off that and\\xa0\\xa0 it made it so much simpler but yeah digital eyes\\xa0\\nwhen you don't know like the process you're just\\xa0\\xa0 like oh okay let's wait and see yeah yeah when you\\xa0\\ndon't know it's an issue but when you go through\\xa0\\xa0 it and you have more experience that's what it's\\xa0\\nall about after a few years after a couple of\\xa0\\xa0 years yeah yeah so you come to poland for a person\\xa0\\nyeah how did you meet this person the first time\\xa0\\xa0 did you you know where was it how did this\\xa0\\nall happen the story tell me your love story\\xa0\\xa0 all right so i was traveling in india as i told\\xa0\\nyou and towards the end of my trip i met matos yeah and you know it was really nice\\xa0\\nwe had many things in common and was\\xa0\\xa0 very nice to spend time with him and then\\xa0\\nwe decided to travel a bit more together\\xa0\\xa0 but i was just like we were together but we\\xa0\\ndidn't have any plans to be together of course\\xa0\\xa0 uh he has his life going on i had\\xa0\\nmy life and we're like okay bye bye\\xa0\\xa0 so i went back to states tried to figure out\\xa0\\nmy own life there he came back to katowice\\xa0\\xa0 i was thinking about which country to move i got\\xa0\\nsome job offer and some country in the middle east\\xa0\\xa0 and or i was thinking about moving to california i\\xa0\\nwas a bit confused and then talking to him we were\\xa0\\xa0 having contact every day talking uh\\xa0\\nevery day on the phone or through skype\\xa0\\xa0 so we are kind of very bounded but even though\\xa0\\nwe're abundant we didn't have any plans to be\\xa0\\xa0 together or anything like that but it like\\xa0\\nthis subject came up like oh why not poland\\xa0\\xa0 so why not you come to poland and see and\\xa0\\ni was like all right okay so i checked the\\xa0\\xa0 flight tickets and i packed my stuff i can't\\xa0\\nso yeah where'd you stay when you got here\\xa0\\xa0 in where where did you stay when you're in here\\xa0\\nin katowice you just went right to what you\\xa0\\xa0 you moved right into get out of here yeah you\\xa0\\njust moved right into matteo's apartment yeah\\xa0\\xa0 that's crazy yeah yeah it was it\\xa0\\nwas a time where he was living in a\\xa0\\xa0 big apartment with other people like roommates and\\xa0\\nwas kind of very cool because we're like different\\xa0\\xa0 open-minded people and doing different things some\\xa0\\npeople like stew students other people working and\\xa0\\xa0 you know it felt very very very nice and it was\\xa0\\nalso my first experience of having roommates of\\xa0\\xa0 course after quite some time you want some\\xa0\\nmore privacy and you don't wanna you know\\xa0\\xa0 be in a shared apartment but in the beginning\\xa0\\nit was really fun it was very very nice that's\\xa0\\xa0 ridiculous i meet this guy in india talking over\\xa0\\nthe internet says come to poland yeah pack my bags\\xa0\\xa0 jumped on a plane and where do i stay not in\\xa0\\nhostel didn't didn't rent my own apartment i just\\xa0\\xa0 went right into him with his roommates that's like\\xa0\\nthat's i give you that's courage man for real some\\xa0\\xa0 people fall like you may be crazy you don't even\\xa0\\nknow if this relationship gonna work at all i can\\xa0\\xa0 hear the comments right now like you're nuts it's\\xa0\\nlike no it was very nice it was very very cool\\xa0\\xa0 that's super super awesome did you have a\\xa0\\npolish wedding or a brazilian wedding or both\\xa0\\xa0 no we just had a very simple polish wedding\\xa0\\ni was married i was pregnant already\\xa0\\xa0 and we just had like a very simple\\xa0\\nceremony with closed friends so no\\xa0\\xa0 massive ceremony the church no crazy party no\\xa0\\nno and i was pregnant you were pregnant and i\\xa0\\xa0 know that the polish weddings they are very\\xa0\\nintense oh my god i mean traditionally right\\xa0\\xa0 like three days or something and lots of vodka\\xa0\\nand and i was you know it was not a time for us\\xa0\\xa0 so just chill yes close friends close family and\\xa0\\nwe went out to have some some dinner and it was\\xa0\\xa0 very simple like that did your family come over\\xa0\\nfrom brazil no because you know we're depending\\xa0\\xa0 on the ooze on for the paper so we didn't know\\xa0\\nexactly the date we could get married we just\\xa0\\xa0 knew one week like you can get married on this\\xa0\\ndate and then we're like organizing some court\\xa0\\xa0 like okay we're gonna get married next week\\xa0\\nand what's everything like that super quick\\xa0\\xa0 decisions bing bang boom yeah in and out making\\xa0\\nit happen yeah it was nothing like how we have\\xa0\\xa0 seven months to plan and invite family over you\\xa0\\nknow that takes so much planning yeah with an\\xa0\\xa0 international wedding of that you know and it's\\xa0\\nnot even not even it being of a large scale it's\\xa0\\xa0 just there's a ton of planning that goes on for\\xa0\\nstuff like that parents cousins siblings friends\\xa0\\xa0 and this idea of getting married in brazil is\\xa0\\nvery romantic but at this time of our lives i\\xa0\\xa0 don't think we're planning anything like that\\xa0\\nokay especially now with pandemia it's just like\\xa0\\xa0 yeah yeah have you been to a polish\\xa0\\nwedding in your time here those traditional\\xa0\\xa0 yeah no no i haven't no okay i was going to ask\\xa0\\nyou what are the differences between you know a\\xa0\\xa0 brazilian wedding and a polish wedding i know like\\xa0\\nthose little uh you know games and traditions they\\xa0\\xa0 usually do during the polish wedding but i haven't\\xa0\\nbeen one no no no no you've gotta experience\\xa0\\xa0 a polish wedding it's crazy you have to it's\\xa0\\nunbelievable okay i'll wait for you to get married you're on you're on the fence list for sure you're\\xa0\\ncoming over definitely all right cool so you've\\xa0\\xa0 never been to a polish win that's so crazy no i\\xa0\\nhaven't all your friends and stuff here but um\\xa0\\xa0 every five years matthieu's family make this\\xa0\\nbig family reunion that is about 300 people\\xa0\\xa0 do we go somewhere you know and spend like a\\xa0\\nweekend together and that was for me like crazy\\xa0\\xa0 like just like probably like a polish wedding but\\xa0\\nlike a polish family reunion of 300 people with\\xa0\\xa0 like alcohol and kielbasa all day long and like\\xa0\\ncrazy stuff time yeah all the time you know in\\xa0\\xa0 one of the clubs there's a few clubs i do this\\xa0\\nyear once the clubs get open again but you can go\\xa0\\xa0 it's like a fake wedding that happens and\\xa0\\nyou can go experience a polish running just\\xa0\\xa0 in the club you know you have to pay of course\\xa0\\nyou're not invited free of charge but yeah um\\xa0\\xa0 that's recommended go go do that once the clubs\\xa0\\nopen up there's that there's like someone gets\\xa0\\xa0 i mean it's a fake bride and groom of course and\\xa0\\nokay but the food and the drink and the dancing oh\\xa0\\xa0 that's funny i never heard about that yeah i know\\xa0\\nwhen i saw the advertisement first i was like what\\xa0\\xa0 monica's like yeah like you can go be a guest\\xa0\\nat the wedding you have to pay but it's like\\xa0\\xa0 a polish wedding you're like this is a great\\xa0\\nidea you know i would love to bring my friends\\xa0\\xa0 something like that bring a suit guys bring a suit\\xa0\\noh you need to dress up accordingly yeah of course\\xa0\\xa0 yeah dude get on your best clubber nice put the\\xa0\\nput the dress on the heels with the makeup on\\xa0\\xa0 let's go have fun right yeah man definitely check\\xa0\\nit out after this crazy pandemia is over maybe\\xa0\\xa0 yeah what made you say that this is where i want\\xa0\\nto live like what kind of solidified it for you\\xa0\\xa0 um yeah i mean it felt very easygoing to be here\\xa0\\nlike you know the it's just a very easygoing\\xa0\\xa0 lifestyle comparing to united states or brazil\\xa0\\nfor example i feel like i feel safe i go out on\\xa0\\xa0 the streets i don't feel like that much paranoid\\xa0\\nabout being robbed like in brazil or it just feels\\xa0\\xa0 easier like of course the language for me is not\\xa0\\neasy it's super difficult everyone every every\\xa0\\xa0 person i've interviewed so far has said the same\\xa0\\nthing and every foreigner i talk to says that too\\xa0\\xa0 like it's just such a difficult language\\xa0\\nto understand and to speak so so yeah but\\xa0\\xa0 safety 100 yeah i feel you yeah the cost of living\\xa0\\nis it's not that that expensive comparing to it's\\xa0\\xa0 going up though it's going up yeah it's more like\\xa0\\nkato pizza is becoming more like worse so now yeah\\xa0\\xa0 but comparing to rio where i'm from\\xa0\\nit's definitely not that crazy and then\\xa0\\xa0 i feel like the quality of life even though we're\\xa0\\nin the city which is katowice i feel that is still\\xa0\\xa0 like not crazy busy as a big city you know what\\xa0\\ni mean definitely yeah it's not like the warsaw\\xa0\\xa0 hustle and bustle it's not the krakov traffic it's\\xa0\\nlike it's it's on a different scale if you will\\xa0\\xa0 it's a city and you have all these things readily\\xa0\\navailable to you i mean yeah walking distance yeah\\xa0\\xa0 exactly jopka florist butcher taylor you go out\\xa0\\nyour flat and you have everything available bank\\xa0\\xa0 pizza yeah so it has the big city it has a city\\xa0\\nvibe without yeah it's very easy going here i\\xa0\\xa0 would say definitely i can agree i can 100 agree\\xa0\\nthere isn't the sense of uh i know people say you\\xa0\\xa0 know but america isn't it better for you blah blah\\xa0\\nblah and i said well it's a lot it's a lot easier\\xa0\\xa0 to live here it's not so much stress yeah you\\xa0\\nknow you're not you're not being pounded with\\xa0\\xa0 you have to make a million dollars money\\xa0\\nmoney money money two jobs three jobs\\xa0\\xa0 four jobs yes it's yeah people don't and you\\xa0\\nsay like i work three jobs and people like\\xa0\\xa0 you're crazy yeah like you're you're nuts\\xa0\\nhow many jobs did you work was like i worked\\xa0\\xa0 i was out from 7am to like 10 p.m at night you\\xa0\\nnever saw your kid rarely i was like what are\\xa0\\xa0 you doing with your life yeah you're like i'm\\xa0\\nchasing that dollar you're like you're stupid\\xa0\\xa0 but i think it's just it's uh it's a you come\\xa0\\nto i don't know if it's in europe in general but\\xa0\\xa0 at least here in poland i feel like people give\\xa0\\nmore value on staying with family spending time\\xa0\\xa0 holidays together and as in states you have a\\xa0\\nfree time you want to fill it up your schedule\\xa0\\xa0 with another job right so i feel like a huge\\xa0\\ndifference um moving to poland but i had that\\xa0\\xa0 mentality before as well but i couldn't see it so\\xa0\\nhere i felt like oh okay i don't need to be in the\\xa0\\xa0 rat race you know super yeah and what was the\\xa0\\nmost attractive thing when you were looking\\xa0\\xa0 at poland you're doing all this research what\\xa0\\nwas the most attractive thing to say i have\\xa0\\xa0 all these options of other countries but\\xa0\\ni'm really interested in this country what\\xa0\\xa0 was the most attractive thing well i didn't\\xa0\\nchose poland because of attractions right\\xa0\\xa0 i came here because of a person but uh when i\\xa0\\nwas i saw that like the big green forest here\\xa0\\xa0 was like just wall poland is really green and i\\xa0\\nreally like that you know everywhere you go you\\xa0\\xa0 is surrounded by forests so you can you know have\\xa0\\nuh contact with nature in a very easy going way\\xa0\\xa0 yeah you don't need to drive to a national park\\xa0\\nand you know like it's just very accessible to\\xa0\\xa0 be in the nature in poland yeah you're the second\\xa0\\nperson or actually a few people have said that too\\xa0\\xa0 that you just i know that i go out of my house\\xa0\\nand if i just take a left and i drive i don't know\\xa0\\xa0 five minutes forest yeah like forest yeah there's\\xa0\\nand in nature is all around you i mean it's\\xa0\\xa0 it really is successful when you think about it\\xa0\\nyou're not and you're driving you would have to\\xa0\\xa0 go out of the suburbs through the city limits get\\xa0\\nout go to the national park um i feel like and\\xa0\\xa0 it depends on where you live in america for the\\xa0\\naccessibility to nature but i can definitely\\xa0\\xa0 understand your point of view of it was really\\xa0\\ndifficult sometimes and you have to go drive\\xa0\\xa0 yeah and in rio in brazil the same you know even\\xa0\\nthough we have like this abundance of um you know\\xa0\\xa0 wild force or beaches you still need to drive\\xa0\\nto get stress in the traffic and you know\\xa0\\xa0 the stress in the traffic after you a few hours\\xa0\\nyou'll try to relax in this nature spot but it's\\xa0\\xa0 not easy to get after you've decompressed from\\xa0\\nall the traveling all the stress you get out\\xa0\\xa0 of the car and you're like and then you need to\\xa0\\nget stressed back back you got to go back in the\\xa0\\xa0 car to get back to where you were go through all\\xa0\\nthat yeah oh my god yeah so what's some of your\\xa0\\xa0 favorite nature spots around here um i really\\xa0\\ndon't know the name in polish but you know like\\xa0\\xa0 um i like to go to this uh kojov park it's just\\xa0\\nlike a very short uh park you're talking about\\xa0\\xa0 yeah it's a very short uh drive or train uh\\xa0\\ndrum um ride i don't know 25 minutes 30 minutes\\xa0\\xa0 and yeah we always have lots of fun there it's\\xa0\\ngood for kids is we always find places there we\\xa0\\xa0 can be alone so there's not a lot of people around\\xa0\\nand yeah it's very calming and relaxing there\\xa0\\xa0 so three similarities of poland and brazil and\\xa0\\nthree differences okay similarities i would say\\xa0\\xa0 uh this type of connection with family which it\\xa0\\nseems very strong here and in brazil is the same\\xa0\\xa0 you know like you it's very often that you see\\xa0\\nthat younger generation they are like going to\\xa0\\xa0 spend holidays with their elders\\xa0\\nand things like that it's very\\xa0\\xa0 important for them to have easter together\\xa0\\nchristmas together and it seems that the holidays\\xa0\\xa0 here they're a bit longer than in the other\\xa0\\ncountries maybe because of the catholic church\\xa0\\xa0 but i feel like it's very important for them to\\xa0\\nhave this time together which in brazil is very\\xa0\\xa0 similar as well during the holidays to spend time\\xa0\\nwith family um i also feel that people here are\\xa0\\xa0 very open and friendly once you meet them once\\xa0\\nyou get in the circle yeah but it's like i think\\xa0\\xa0 it's a bit easier going than in other countries\\xa0\\nlike if you compare to norway for example i feel\\xa0\\xa0 that people there they are very close and very\\xa0\\nhard to try to understand if the person is up to\\xa0\\xa0 a friendship or not but here it's like you know\\xa0\\nyou feel the person it's like it's once you have\\xa0\\xa0 the opportunity to talk and you know the person\\xa0\\nopen ups is is very easy just like in brazil\\xa0\\xa0 um yeah but i would say the number one\\xa0\\nuh similarity is the the family bound\\xa0\\xa0 and also the catholic church as well not as\\xa0\\num let's say strong as in poland i feel that\\xa0\\xa0 poland is the most extremist catholic\\xa0\\ncountry that i ever have been same here\\xa0\\xa0 um but yeah in brazil the majority is\\xa0\\nalso catholic but not as much as here\\xa0\\xa0 yeah i can agree with you with the uh\\xa0\\nholidays feeling longer christmas is\\xa0\\xa0 three days yeah yeah yeah 24th 25th 26th yeah that\\xa0\\nwas crazy for me like what 26. yeah what are you\\xa0\\xa0 doing to 26 like i'm going to work like no no no\\xa0\\nyou're not you're sitting home you're going to eat\\xa0\\xa0 some more car there's plenty of food to be eating\\xa0\\nstill and then easter also you have easter monday\\xa0\\xa0 you know so those and then of course other\\xa0\\nholidays and this is going to be a reoccurring\\xa0\\xa0 theme i've people love taking off the uh\\xa0\\noh i have i have a monday after the holiday\\xa0\\xa0 oh maybe i'll take tuesday off as well or i'll\\xa0\\ntake the friday before and extend my weekends like\\xa0\\xa0 people people love doing that here yeah it's very\\xa0\\nsimilar to extend the holidays or like if you have\\xa0\\xa0 a holiday on thursday you just like eat friday\\xa0\\nright so you don't do anything on friday and then\\xa0\\xa0 you extend completely that is very uh similar\\xa0\\nas in brazil as well so three differences now\\xa0\\xa0 oh the weather for sure that's number one number\\xa0\\none yeah the lack of sun here it's big i feel like\\xa0\\xa0 the summer is very nice but like for example right\\xa0\\nnow it's supposed to be spring and it just feels\\xa0\\xa0 like an extension of winter still winter um this\\xa0\\nis april april 17th yeah so it feels like most of\\xa0\\xa0 the year is gray and cold and then it's like three\\xa0\\nmonths of hot weather where you can use a t-shirt\\xa0\\xa0 and maybe sandals and then just go back to jackets\\xa0\\nand boots so the weather is the main thing and the\\xa0\\xa0 lack of sun is big as well for me comparing to\\xa0\\nbrazil where it's like sunny mostly all year\\xa0\\xa0 and of course like when you want to buy some\\xa0\\nuh let's say something silly like bananas right\\xa0\\xa0 you go to the store all the bananas they're green\\xa0\\nthat's like 90 percent super green for sure there\\xa0\\xa0 will be green so like buying fresh fruits like\\xa0\\nin brazil is it's completely different right you\\xa0\\xa0 you can go to brazil and buy a banana or avocado\\xa0\\nand eat on the same day basically and here you\\xa0\\xa0 you wait for a week to eat avocado when we\\xa0\\nsee it's already bad you need to throw away\\xa0\\xa0 because you forgot to eat avocados are so hard\\xa0\\nto get yeah nail here for sure but the cherries\\xa0\\xa0 are very good when it's cherry season and\\xa0\\nyeah it's my favorite the polish cherries\\xa0\\xa0 but for sure weather fresh fruits give me one more\\xa0\\none more the differences right yeah and the safety\\xa0\\xa0 of course the safety of course here in poland\\xa0\\ni it's like you feel as a brazilian you feel\\xa0\\xa0 so free you go out on the street you can open your\\xa0\\nbag and get your cell phone and you know just do\\xa0\\xa0 whatever talk on your phone and you're not scared\\xa0\\nthat somebody's gonna come and say like look give\\xa0\\xa0 me your phone it's mine now or give me your\\xa0\\nshoes it you know it's like that doesn't happen\\xa0\\xa0 not well i got i got robbed in katowice not like\\xa0\\nin brazil i forgot the door of my apartment open\\xa0\\xa0 i left it open somebody entered and took my my\\xa0\\nwallet but you know we're in the city center so\\xa0\\xa0 those things happen but no one ever forced\\xa0\\nyou like give your nah like in brazil i got\\xa0\\xa0 i got uh the gun pointed on me like two times so\\xa0\\ni know those things there they don't happen here\\xa0\\xa0 which makes me feel very safe and relaxed\\xa0\\nespecially now that i have a small child\\xa0\\xa0 yeah i can totally agree with you with\\xa0\\nyou there for sure three things you love\\xa0\\xa0 and three things you hate okay i think i'll\\xa0\\nstart with the three things i hate because\\xa0\\xa0 it comes first okay it's not that i hate the\\xa0\\nlanguage but i it's a love hate relationship\\xa0\\xa0 when i arrived here i entered her school in\\xa0\\na language school so i could be kind of legal\\xa0\\xa0 as a student and i entered in um foreign\\xa0\\nschool that was supposed to be every day\\xa0\\xa0 from monday to friday and with so much work\\xa0\\nand material and i got like i really disliked\\xa0\\xa0 and for me it's just very difficult to understand\\xa0\\nthe structure of this language it's like it's keep\\xa0\\xa0 changing there's so many variations and when i\\xa0\\nthink i learn the correct way to say something\\xa0\\xa0 there are like more ten different types yes just\\xa0\\nsay the same thing i just feel like man i don't\\xa0\\xa0 have time to learn this language i need at least\\xa0\\n10 years of living working here yeah it's just\\xa0\\xa0 like when i feel i have some time to study polish\\xa0\\ni want to just read something else it's just like\\xa0\\xa0 very hard for me but i know it's important\\xa0\\nas a brazilian living in poland and i have uh\\xa0\\xa0 you know a son that he's half a brazilian and half\\xa0\\npolish and he's going to preschool now and he gets\\xa0\\xa0 home and he starts saying polish things and i'm\\xa0\\nlike what are you saying i have the same issue\\xa0\\xa0 sometimes with with my son because he'll come and\\xa0\\ni'll say what does that mean and he's like daddy\\xa0\\xa0 he looks at me and he's like he'll say it back\\xa0\\nto me i'm like i don't know what you're saying\\xa0\\xa0 like i don't man i'm trying also by the way so\\xa0\\nyeah the language i i told you the language is\\xa0\\xa0 a loving hate relationship i feel very happy\\xa0\\nwhen i try to speak polish and people get\\xa0\\xa0 excited like whoa bianca you say it in polish\\xa0\\nyeah very good and i feel like i'm proud of myself\\xa0\\xa0 i ordered the black coffee one time i was like\\xa0\\nand they were like you speak polish i'm like i\\xa0\\xa0 just ordered a coin man that's all i said\\xa0\\ndon't ask me anything else so yeah polish\\xa0\\xa0 is uh one of the things that i would put on\\xa0\\nthis list of hate okay it's not that i hate 100\\xa0\\xa0 but it's it is there all right so there you\\xa0\\ngo yeah number one number two number two\\xa0\\xa0 weather of course come on it could be a bit warmer\\xa0\\nhere definitely i agree i love the sun i hear you\\xa0\\xa0 however when it's very cold and snowy it's\\xa0\\nvery beautiful i really it's it's very\\xa0\\xa0 it's like magical when everything is white it's\\xa0\\nlike super super nice but when it's just like\\xa0\\xa0 wet and rainy and all this like funky weather it's\\xa0\\njust like oh gosh and and i made sometimes beach\\xa0\\xa0 you know a very nice beach and baltic sea\\xa0\\nfor me it's not considerately to go to swim\\xa0\\xa0 maybe some polish people will feel offended by\\xa0\\ni when they tell me i'm going for holiday stood\\xa0\\xa0 about taxi like that place is not for holidays\\xa0\\nit's too cold and it's the water's so cold i was\\xa0\\xa0 oh we went in august last year yeah i mean it's\\xa0\\nbeautiful but it's just way too cold yeah it's\\xa0\\xa0 like nonsense oh i hear you those three things um\\xa0\\nyeah for me it's crazy now there are many things\\xa0\\xa0 i love about poland and the easy going lifestyle\\xa0\\nhere the access to health care and to education is\\xa0\\xa0 i would say that is much better than in\\xa0\\nbrazil for sure here i get very good and and\\xa0\\xa0 fast healthcare comparing to brazil that i\\xa0\\nwould stand on the line for many hours and\\xa0\\xa0 things like that comparing i mean compared to\\xa0\\nthe public health care system the education also\\xa0\\xa0 my son he goes to a public preschool and the\\xa0\\nquality of the preschools here it seems much\\xa0\\xa0 better than the public schools in brazil i'm\\xa0\\nsuper impressed with the education system here\\xa0\\xa0 and how accessible oh your son's three great\\xa0\\nhe can go free of yeah yeah mother gets paid\\xa0\\xa0 years one to three stay home with the child paid\\xa0\\nby the by the country and then three years old\\xa0\\xa0 no i'm not we're not paying out of pocket for\\xa0\\nnursery school here or day care you can but\\xa0\\xa0 we don't in states to go to a university\\xa0\\nyou need to invest so much money right\\xa0\\xa0 and then you like in-depth and have to work\\xa0\\ninstead at the same time or like you need\\xa0\\xa0 to pay for many years whatever money you you\\xa0\\nyou took from the government right to go to\\xa0\\xa0 school and in in poland is different as a\\xa0\\npolish you can go to university for free\\xa0\\xa0 yeah so it's like i'm still paying off debt from\\xa0\\nmy university and i will be out of school for\\xa0\\xa0 close to 15 years now and i'm still paying off\\xa0\\nuniversity debts and i'm not using my university\\xa0\\xa0 degree by any means so yeah so in terms of health\\xa0\\nand education comparing to to brazil or to states\\xa0\\xa0 because the health in state is extremely expensive\\xa0\\nlike i was talking to an american woman other day\\xa0\\xa0 that her son broke the arm while in states and\\xa0\\nwas about with ambulance and these and that\\xa0\\xa0 blah blah blah was i think almost twenty\\xa0\\nthousand dollars because he had surgery\\xa0\\xa0 and nights in the hospital and the ambulance and\\xa0\\nblah blah blah blah blah he stayed for a few days\\xa0\\xa0 in the hospital and it was about twenty thousand\\xa0\\ndollars and me you know x-rays everything else\\xa0\\xa0 right right in states is not less than 500\\xa0\\nyeah so in screw for the bone is a thousand\\xa0\\xa0 and in poland it's like you go you do something\\xa0\\ncomplicated it's like you know it's not that much\\xa0\\xa0 money right or none at all no none at all so i do\\xa0\\nfeel that the health system and the the education\\xa0\\xa0 here of course is much better inter in f in terms\\xa0\\nof you know uh financially or or quality as well\\xa0\\xa0 maybe not quality as in states but like public\\xa0\\nequality comparing to to brazil for sure\\xa0\\xa0 it is much better 100 yeah yeah i i can agree\\xa0\\nwith you on those points how would you rate the\\xa0\\xa0 polish health care system here the rate like in\\xa0\\nnumbers you mean like give me a number one to ten\\xa0\\xa0 poor to superior excellent awesome however you'd\\xa0\\nwant to rate it what how would you rate the polish\\xa0\\xa0 i mean i can only rate according to the experience\\xa0\\nof the countries i have lived before right\\xa0\\xa0 so i would say superior to to brazil\\xa0\\nor in terms of quality for sure um\\xa0\\xa0 yeah definitely superior compared to america uh in\\xa0\\nterms of accessibility price yeah superior as well\\xa0\\xa0 from my experience being there right even though\\xa0\\ni had health care in in states if i had to do like\\xa0\\xa0 i don't know some visit that was after seven\\xa0\\no'clock or something like that i would have\\xa0\\xa0 to end up paying you know 150 dollars\\xa0\\njust for a little chuckle here and there\\xa0\\xa0 so that's one of the things i'm so impressed\\xa0\\nof here is that i can call at you know doctors\\xa0\\xa0 with lux med i have lux med private health\\xa0\\ninsurance and six o'clock i'm not feeling\\xa0\\xa0 good call hey we have an appointment for you at 7\\xa0\\n30. 7 30 today yeah 7 30. come on down no problem\\xa0\\xa0 so yeah accessibility is is awesome i would say\\xa0\\neasy yeah yeah in brazil even though if you have a\\xa0\\xa0 healthcare you need to make an appointment\\xa0\\nmaybe you're gonna have to wait for one month\\xa0\\xa0 and then you you know if you're ill if you if\\xa0\\nyou know it's there is emerge emergency and\\xa0\\xa0 non-emergency right so if it's like non-emergency\\xa0\\nwho knows how long you're gonna have to wait to\\xa0\\xa0 have your appointment seriously yeah wow yeah okay\\xa0\\nthat's that's a yeah and here it's like maybe i\\xa0\\xa0 mean with nfs that do you have you have public\\xa0\\nhealth insurance or private health insurance\\xa0\\xa0 yeah so i know it's like maybe you might have to\\xa0\\nwait a day for an appointment to get in to see\\xa0\\xa0 a doctor but usually it's fairly quickly yeah\\xa0\\nfor specialists though i hear it's definitely\\xa0\\xa0 longer cardiologists ophthalmologists yeah if you\\xa0\\nneed something complicated like i don't know like\\xa0\\xa0 a hip surgery or something like that it may take a\\xa0\\nlong time a couple months i've heard and even for\\xa0\\xa0 an eye doctor i've definitely heard the wait time\\xa0\\nis about two three months to go see an eye doctor\\xa0\\xa0 so but then you know in something like that\\xa0\\nit happens that i would just go for a private\\xa0\\xa0 doctor yeah so i'll get the appointment there and\\xa0\\nlike uh it's not that expensive comparing if i go\\xa0\\xa0 to a private doctor in states for example yeah so\\xa0\\nsame with the dentist i mean i've gone private to\\xa0\\xa0 a dentist and you know some i would say a really\\xa0\\na really deep cavity that will require some heart\\xa0\\xa0 some hard you know drilling and filling and\\xa0\\nsculpting 250s what day yeah okay in states\\xa0\\xa0 that would not even be that'd be i mean that'd\\xa0\\nbe thousands maybe thousands we got quoted for\\xa0\\xa0 one root canal it was 2400 2500 because monaco\\xa0\\nwas uninsured and yeah it was 2500 i said we\\xa0\\xa0 both agreed it'd be cheaper to fly to poland have\\xa0\\nvacation yeah get her entire mouth fixed yeah fly\\xa0\\xa0 back then go visit a dentist when you're uninsured\\xa0\\nyeah and it's not a big deal here it's so like\\xa0\\xa0 things with things with that are are in that realm\\xa0\\ni'm just so impressed with that it's that cheap\\xa0\\xa0 mm-hmm yeah like 250 yeah that's it yeah do my\\xa0\\nwhole mouth man you know yeah when i was living\\xa0\\xa0 in portugal um about two years ago we were there\\xa0\\nfor one year because matthias was doing erasmus\\xa0\\xa0 program and there were a lot of people just flying\\xa0\\nyou know portuguese people that lives for example\\xa0\\xa0 in switzerland or sweden or whatever they are\\xa0\\nflying from those countries back to portugal just\\xa0\\xa0 to get those type of cheaper services and good at\\xa0\\nthe same time because you know it's just cheaper\\xa0\\xa0 in poland the same i'm pretty sure there\\xa0\\nare people that you know i know people that\\xa0\\xa0 for example they live in germany and they\\xa0\\nfly from there here to get their stuff done\\xa0\\xa0 yeah go back yeah so yeah it just makes more sense\\xa0\\nno i i hear you definitely so you gave birth here\\xa0\\xa0 yeah in poland which which hospital oh god i don't\\xa0\\nknow the name of but it's like the hospital worker\\xa0\\xa0 i don't know that's where oliver\\xa0\\nwas born should we televoy vodski\\xa0\\xa0 yeah it's the same hospital where matteos was\\xa0\\nborn so it's right off the s1 the highway do\\xa0\\xa0 you take that exit and it's on the left-hand\\xa0\\nside maybe maybe they're like i was giving try to get this baby out of my body i don't\\xa0\\nknow where i'm being taken yeah walked it was a\\xa0\\xa0 okay experience was was good so talk to us about\\xa0\\nthe care you received if you remember during birth\\xa0\\xa0 but mainly i'm really concerned about after the\\xa0\\naftercare of mother child care i was going to a\\xa0\\xa0 doctor in tehei and i told him in the beginning\\xa0\\nthat you know i wanted to to have a more natural\\xa0\\xa0 birth as much as possible so he recommended me\\xa0\\nthis hospital in tehe that was good we had some\\xa0\\xa0 classes in the afternoon in this hospital from\\xa0\\nthe nurses on like what works fact during the\\xa0\\xa0 pregnancy how to do after and all those you know\\xa0\\nnewborn cares and everything and was pretty cool\\xa0\\xa0 was free and was like um yeah it was nice the\\xa0\\nexperience of giving birth in the hospital was\\xa0\\xa0 very positive i felt supported and even though\\xa0\\nwe i couldn't communicate at all in english\\xa0\\xa0 with them with the nurses matus was he or he were\\xa0\\nallowed he was allowed to be with me all the time\\xa0\\xa0 and that is something that usually uh in in\\xa0\\nbrazil i don't think it's possible to i didn't\\xa0\\xa0 think about that that you don't speak any polish\\xa0\\nand you have polish nurses taking care of you yeah\\xa0\\xa0 and you can't even communicate with them you're\\xa0\\ngoing through this life event of giving birth to\\xa0\\xa0 your child but yeah i tell you i was i was there\\xa0\\nfor oliver's birth too i was i was around i was\\xa0\\xa0 next to monica yeah so even though we didn't speak\\xa0\\nthe same language we couldn't communicate i felt\\xa0\\xa0 well supported um the after birth i had to stay\\xa0\\nthree days as a rule in the hospital and the after\\xa0\\xa0 birth i got like many times a visit from a nurse\\xa0\\nto checking the baby to help me to take care of\\xa0\\xa0 the belly button thing and how to breastfeed\\xa0\\nand you know like it was really cool i felt\\xa0\\xa0 like really well supported like it was very nice\\xa0\\ndid you have the midwife coming to the hospital\\xa0\\xa0 uh coming to your house yeah after yeah how long\\xa0\\ndid that last um it was coming like every week\\xa0\\xa0 maybe four times yeah so the first month so it's a\\xa0\\nmonth of yeah so she was checking the belly button\\xa0\\xa0 um checking how to br you know in the beginning\\xa0\\nthe breastfeeding it's complicated right sometimes\\xa0\\xa0 i have no experience you know like uh it's\\xa0\\nsometimes it's too much milk production and\\xa0\\xa0 then many things happen anyway she was like\\xa0\\ngiving really good tips and how to baffle the\\xa0\\xa0 babyship bath him with me and how to hold how to\\xa0\\nput to sleep how to make comfortable she was like\\xa0\\xa0 really giving out her experience and like yeah it\\xa0\\nwas very natural for her and it was very natural\\xa0\\xa0 for me too even though i didn't know her it was\\xa0\\ni felt like she was a very nice person to be in\\xa0\\xa0 my house in that moment yeah i can agree with\\xa0\\nyou there i was i was shown how to bathe oliver\\xa0\\xa0 dress him you know if he had the colic or the\\xa0\\nstomach issue and turn the baby over pat like\\xa0\\xa0 this put the baby on your chest lay down like\\xa0\\nthis it's like i would have never thought about\\xa0\\xa0 that yeah for me it was really important because\\xa0\\nyou know i'm all my family is back in brazil so\\xa0\\xa0 i don't have like support from my mother or my\\xa0\\ngrandmother i don't have their type of wisdom\\xa0\\xa0 in in this subject they can tell me something\\xa0\\non the phone but they are not there physically\\xa0\\xa0 so having this woman from time to time was really\\xa0\\nhelpful yeah i agree yeah it's such a great thing\\xa0\\xa0 here i would say all right so now let's let's\\xa0\\nmove forward to some schools and such how do you\\xa0\\xa0 how do you what are some differences between\\xa0\\npreschool and brazil and preschool here yeah in\\xa0\\xa0 poland the preschools um in brazil they are good\\xa0\\nif they're um not from the government let's say if\\xa0\\xa0 they're like private private yeah so you have all\\xa0\\nthose different options those extra classes and\\xa0\\xa0 very nice toys and playground and things like\\xa0\\nthat if it's public it's probably the quality\\xa0\\xa0 it's not that good and you know public teachers\\xa0\\nthey don't pay they are not paid that well so\\xa0\\xa0 maybe sometimes they don't even\\xa0\\nthey they they don't go to work\\xa0\\xa0 and then you know the kids are like okay no\\xa0\\nteachers today so probably the parents need\\xa0\\xa0 to take them back home and then they miss a\\xa0\\nday of work so i think it's more complicated\\xa0\\xa0 teachers aren't paid well here either the\\xa0\\nteachers are not paid very well for sure and uh\\xa0\\xa0 i noticed that the i can say the pat\\xa0\\nexcuse me the passion with the teachers is\\xa0\\xa0 superb man yeah they really love what they do\\xa0\\nright so you have it's it's not as accessible\\xa0\\xa0 in brazil public preschool to preschool here\\xa0\\nin poland yeah i would say that i feel much\\xa0\\xa0

       " \"When you will be doing business in Poland you will have to pay some taxes First of all, you will have to pay a VAT tax. This is obligatory for all companies with turnover exceeds $200,000 which means the majority of companies will pay it it is basically 23 percent for all goods and services majority of them have this rate some of them top eight five four zero percent depending on the industry and depending if the good is delivered inside the country or outside the same applies to services, but basically what you should remember is 23% of VAT Another tax is CIT, which means corporate income tax in this case Most of the time you will have a flat rate which is 19 percent when you start a business You have something which is called a discount for a start. And in this case the tax rate would be nine percent pretty nice this tax rate can be applied for the enterprises which have an income lower than 1.2 million euros loss per year there are some exceptions from this rule and Actually there ho there is a whole list of exceptions I would just like to tell you that there is a window that you might be the lucky one who would buy nine percent The third type of tax is your personal income tax when you get some income from your company in terms of sole proprietorship you will either pay your corporate income tax or You will have your personal income tax in this case. It is divided into three Thresholds first one is 18 percent For let's say approximately eighty five point five polish złotych You will a 18 set of tax for this amount up to this amount And then the second threshold is between eighty five point five up to 1 million. You will have to pay 32% from this amount and then the third threshold is additional 4% so summarize you have eighty five point five and you have 1 million here is a 18% here is 32% and here is 36% But what is worth remembering? You have to consider that when you have the company you first earn your income then you deduct your cost and you pay the tax from what is left and That is the big advantage of having business in general\",\n",

       " 'Last month, The European Union took an unprecedented\\nstep against Poland, one of its member states. The Union invoked its strongest sanction against\\nthe country, which could strip it of its voting rights within the bloc of nations. The move is so extreme, that many foreign\\npolicy experts have even called it the EU’s diplomatic “nuclear option.” But what led to this historic decision, and\\nwhat exactly does it mean for everyone involved? First let\\'s start with the move by the European\\nUnion on December 20th, 2017. The European Commission, which is the executive\\nwing responsible for implementing laws in the EU, announced that it was triggering Article\\n7 of the Union’s Treaty. This action was a big deal too, because it\\nwas also the first time it had ever been used in history. Article 7 was created to prevent nation’s\\nin The Union from adopting policies that threaten democratic institutions, like legislative\\nor judicial branches of government. To be implemented, the measure has two key\\nparts that must be approved. First, after the motion has been triggered,\\nit has to be approved by four-fifths of all Union members and have the backing the european\\nparliament. After that, the European Council gives the\\nnation in question a formal warning and recommendations. The country then has three months to respond,\\nbefore E.U. members have to unanimously vote to launch\\nsanctions and suspend the nation’s voting rights. That makes it pretty hard for these types\\nof measures to go into effect. So while the triggering of Article 7 remains\\nhistoric and could lead to sanctions against poland, it’s pretty much seen as just a\\nsymbolic gesture by the EU. But why Poland and why now? The triggering of Article 7 came as Poland\\'s\\nparliament approved controversial laws that could limit the independence of its judicial\\nbranch. The laws have been seen as consolidation of\\npower for the nation’s right-wing Law and Justice party, which currently hold the most\\nseats in parliament and the presidency. The judicial reforms would essentially allow\\na ruling party to select lower-level judges and dismiss many of the nation’s Supreme\\ncourt Judges. That is what the European Union has a problem\\nwith. They say this type of political interference\\nwith the judicial branch is a risk to the rule of law in Poland, which is a fundamental\\nvalue of the European Union. \"Sadly, our concerns have deepened. Within a period of two years, a significant\\nnumber of laws have been adopted -- 13 in total -- which put at serious risk the independence\\nof the judiciary and the separation of powers in Poland.\" While historic, the motion by the EU didn’t\\njust come out nowhere either. Since the Law and Justice party came to power\\nin 2015, they’ve adopted multiple laws that have affected the judiciary branch. The EU even warned Poland’s President that\\nit might trigger the “nuclear option” if he signed the bills into law, which he\\ndid anyway. This all brings us to the reaction and whether\\nthis will have a lasting impact on Poland and the European Union. While many EU members have voted to take the\\nmeasure against Poland, not all members plan on supporting the implementation of Article\\n7. Hungary, another central european country\\nthat has faced criticism from the EU over its right-wing, populist policies, has said\\nit plan to veto the union’s actions. And since the next phase of the implementation\\nrequires a unanimous vote by European Union members, the action is pretty much dead in\\nthe water. Meaning, Poland’s Law and Justice party’s\\nconsolidation of power appears to be set to continue for at least the near future. The recent laws passed by Poland’s Law and\\nJustice Party really shouldn’t come as a surprise. Since it gained power in 2015, the nation\\nhas become increasingly nationalistic. But what other countries around the world\\nhave seen a rise in nationalism last year? Find out in the video to the right! Thanks for watching NowThis World!

It has a burst rate of fire of three rounds per 15 seconds  and a maximum rate of fire of six to eight rounds a minute for three minutes Sustained rate of fire is two to three rounds a minute for one hour The gun’s firing is controlled by onboard fire-control equipment The information can be transmitted through a data digital radio link or voice communications The automatic loading system places the projectiles onto the ammunition tray ready for fire The K9 Thunder can open fire within 30 seconds at stand out position or within 60 seconds during movement With a price of 10 million USD with the K-10 ammunition truck, or 6 million USD only for the cannon the K9 is one of Korea's most popular weapons thanks to its top-notch technical and combat features as well as its relatively reasonable price\",\n",

       " 'I worked as a KFC service staff member. I was a university student. I used to work with some blokes at a start-up. I worked on a project as a freelancer. I worked at Belarusian Railway. To be frank, I had plenty of time to watch YouTube videos. I felt like I’d reached a glass ceiling and needed to develop in a completely different way. And then I made up my mind to find my calling To change something in my life to start growing. I wished to work with colleagues who have many years of experience  I wanted to work on a project that would keep on evolving. I came for a job interview and I liked it. Right from the start, we got along well. As for communication, it was simple. I\\'ve been working already for three years since that communication episode. In six months I got a promotion. After some time, I got second promotion I came from a junior position to become a middle staff member; and relatively recently I have become a Head guy. Now, I am a Tech Lead. I started in First Line Support, while now I am a Team Lead. The company offers good growth opportunities. If you feel like working hard, it is like a Tinder Match. You will be noticed. It happens quickly. Wouldn’t know in English… Talent foundry Every team has its Tech Lead with whom you can talk or say: in six months, I want to be better than I am today. Company supports this. So, the company gives trainings, gives conferences, pay for it  We follow the careers of our people and do our best to guide them. Well, these are not just words; you can see it by the example of your colleagues who have already reached a certain level. We have training courses, English courses or various workshops for the employees to choose. Half a year later, you approach your Tech Lead and say: “Man! Look here, I do think I have improved!\" And you discuss it. If it is the case, then the promotion process is initiated. You can climb up the career ladder, yes, you can. But at a certain point you hit the ceiling. Yet, a horizontal growth is an alternative To switch between products so because company has like twelve products Many interesting  projects are carried out concurrently. I would like to be part of them all. It is perfectly understandable that you might fall short of  time and effort;  however, it’s much better than having no choice at all, isn’t it? I want to  develop and grow very much. And I do think that every SOFTSWISS employee shares my mindset. I see the prospects and the opportunities that pushed me to think bigger I have an idea, let’s say, a dream about leading positions on the iGaming market. I am still far away from being on par with the most experienced  guys working for us. I am planning, maybe, to try to catch up with them in the years to come. I understand that I want to develop further. I would like very much to find myself on a leading position in a year or so. In a larger sense, I am planning to grow to a senior position so far to become a manager later. You feel it - how the company grows, how your team grows, how changing your tasks, how you get promoted. Аnd to see how I see myself even three years it’s super hard. In SOFTSWISS it’s possible everything.',\n",
       " 'Hey everybody and welcome back to\\nanother Tip Thursday with me Conor Clyne, the Language Tsar, and yes\\nyou are on the right video. It doesn\\'t look like Warsaw, Poland because I\\'m\\nactually in Tenerife but this is the video hundred dollars what it can get\\nyou in Warsaw, Poland. The reason I\\'m shooting this intro in a\\ndifferent location is because there are gonna be some big changes to this\\nchannel, including the name. I\\'ve been playing around with a few different names and don\\'t\\nbe surprised ... it\\'s gonna be the same channel with me Conor so one thing I\\nwanted to know is what you think about this 100 dollar series. Do you think the\\nmoney being should be higher like $500 $1,000? I\\'m thinking of changing that\\nas well as I travel around Europe. Keep your comments coming. Write them below! I\"m\\ngonna be talking a lot about not just about languages also about travelling in\\nthe region and how you can have a more locally epic travel experience and also\\nabout dating because I get a lot of questions about dating. Let\\'s get into\\ntoday\\'s video which is $100 Warsaw, Poland. So let\\'s start with accommodation here\\nin Warsaw. Now if you want a nice apartment in the city center it\\'s gonna\\nset you back about 60 to 80 US dollars. Now you can of course get a lot\\ncheaper if you go outside of the city center so there it\\'s probably gonna be\\ncosting like 40 or 50 US dollars. I used the Airbnb to find my apartment. It\\'s\\nkind of my default when I\\'m traveling and I don\\'t know the city and maybe an\\nagent for apartments in the city where I\\'m traveling to. So that\\'s the kind of\\nprice range you should budget for an apartment in Warsaw. So next up is food: a\\ntwo course meal in a decent restaurant with drinks in the center of Warsaw seems\\nto be costing between 17 and say 23 US dollars so we\\'re doing like 15 yeah\\napproximately 18 or 20 euros depending on where you go and what you eat. Of\\ncourse that fluctuates if you want to eat you know fast food is coming a lot\\ncheaper if you want to go to fine dining if it\\'s gonna be much more expensive but\\nthat\\'s to give you a general ballpark figure and they are the kind of places I\\'ve\\nbeen eating in so I can talk from personal experience that\\'s the kind of\\nbudget that you should expect for food here in restaurants in Warsaw. So next up\\nare drinks if you want to go for a cocktail after a long day of sightseeing\\nhere in Warsaw or maybe you just been hanging out with friends or working from\\na cafe like a lot of you digital nomads tend to do, it\\'s gonna cost you around 20\\nzloty which is five dollars 80 cents US pretty much or a little bit under\\nfive euros for a cocktail here in the center of Warsaw and if you want to go\\nfor a local beer that\\'s gonna be about half that so ten zloty so yeah that\\'s\\ngonna be a little bit more or less three US dollars and if you\\'re a coffee addict\\nlike I am then as you\\'ve seen from my Instagram stories I\\'m always having a\\nfew flat whites somewhere in a nice cafe when I\\'m working that is gonna cost you\\na little bit more than a local beer it\\'s like about 12 zloty as I can see as the\\nprice and that\\'s like about 2 euros 80 or yeah just a little bit over at 3\\nUS dollars that you should budget for. In terms of transport I\\'ve been going\\naround the city actually by Uber and that costs you know more or less between\\n10 and 20 zlotys so yeah anything from maybe three to five or six US\\ndollars is kind of the normal price range for a trip here. I didn\\'t take any\\nofficial taxis I just use Uber because it\\'s my default go to when I\\'m traveling\\nand it\\'s just a lot more convenient and I don\\'t need to download extra apps. So\\nif you actually use taxi apps here in Warsaw or you know a better option and\\nplease write below in the comments section and help everyone else out who\\nmight be coming here to Warsaw. Now if you feel like going to something\\ncultural like maybe the National Museum here in Warsaw. That\\'s also gonna cost you\\ntwenty zloty so that\\'s gonna be a little bit under six US dollars a little\\nbit under five euros for entrance to that. So let\\'s tot all that up and see\\nwhat you can get for your 100 bucks around 80 euros. You\\'re gonna be able to\\nstay in an apartment outside of the city centre, go for two meals in restaurants\\nand then you can throw in maybe two flat whites, two coffees and maybe a\\ncocktail, two beers, your uber to the National Museum and you\\nshould be more or less at a hundred bucks. If you\\'ve been here and you find\\nthe price range I\\'ve given to be too high, too low, you know better ways to\\nsave money then definitely let everybody know in the comments section below the\\nvideo. We\\'re building a great community here of people who are interested in\\ntraveling to the more eastern part of Europe in general so definitely help\\neverybody out and share your experiences and also let me know if you find the\\nprices here in Warsaw expensive or cheap compared to what you were expecting\\nmaybe where you live or where you\\'re normally travel to do you think that\\nWarsaw is good value for money or you think it\\'s a little bit more on the\\nexpensive side.

       " 'The legend of the Warsaw Mermaid According to warsawtour.pl A long time ago,  when Warsaw was a fishing village,  the sea and the river were inhabited by golden-haired mermaids. One day, one of them set off from the Baltic to the south. She swam along the Vistula, admiring the landscapes she passed,  and when she got tired, she decided to rest on the sandy bank of the river at the foot of  today’s Old Town. The area seemed beautiful to the mermaid. “How nice it is here! Why would not I live here?” she thought, and she did.  During the day she splashed in the shallows and she spent the nights in the deep. She liked to play tricks, and the local fishermen suspected  that someone was stirring the water and taking fish from their nets. “We have to do something about this pest!” they shouted. The mermaid was not scared of the fishermen and began to sing a song about the Vistula. The animals listened to her singing, the beavers raised their snouts from their burrows, and the cormorants sat on drifting logs.  The fishermen were moved so much that they gave up their plans and  promised that they would not harm the mermaid. There was still danger, however, for the mermaid. One day, a greedy merchant decided to get rich on her beautiful voice by putting her on display at fairs. He tricked her, kidnapped her and imprisoned her in a wooden chest. The mermaid, accustomed to freedom, was very unhappy. Her crying was heard by the young son of a fisherman who with his friends released her and punished the evil merchant severely. The joyous mermaid, thankful for being free again, pledged to the fishermen that she would always guard them and their village. Over time, the small fishing village became a large and beautiful city. Today, the image of the mermaid armed with a sword and shield appears  in the coat of arms of Warsaw.',\n",

       " \"Hi, very warm welcome! Very warm welcome to each of you! Come see the video where – let’s call it – much has happened! So much has happened, that you, Mr. Editor, forgot about the race… Of a GTR doing 100-200 km/h in barely 3 seconds… Against a twin-turbo R8. So, sit back comfortably and enjoy the show. And such thicc videos like this one... Which we realize both in Poland and USA, by basically combining two videos into one… We’re able to do thanks to your involvement. WWW.7AUT.PL I invite each of you, individually. This is the last event from me, where you can win 7 cars and 30 side prizes. Stop by the website, buy e-books and get the tickets in addition. Enter the game and see the backstage of how we create this channel for you, through the amazing e-books. I hope for the drawing livestream to be a huge event. Also, we prepared a few dope surprises for you. Enter the game and remember, that the Supra you see now… Will be drawn during the first minutes of the livestream, so now is the time to play for it. Without prolonging the introduction, give it a try and I wish good luck to each of you. Remember, your winning chances are equal to zero only, when there’s no tickets to your name. However, like I said – let’s not prolong. I give the floor to myself. We’re moving onto the topic of a car, which has been strongly haunting me for some time. Ever since I was 18, until 23, the R35 GTR’s didn’t cross paths with me… Despite the Godzilla probably being a dream of every kid. Since the Fame GTR, however, I truly fell in love with these cars. I really think, they’re a great base for doing various stuff with them… For example, things like this: Today however, we begin a video under the sign of R35, which will be much wider than the standard R35. We find ourselves under the garage of Łukasz, whom you may remember from the Liberty Walk Huracan project. In addition, that Huracan also has a twin-turbo. There, Łukasz was responsible for the visual part. Come inside then, I’ll show you all the parts in the first minutes of the video… The whole widening pack, the whole idea for the car… And even the wheels, which – come on – aren’t the usual choice. Follow, so we can officially begin the case of Widebody R35 GTR. Welcome very much. Łukasz has such a beautiful garage. Tight but mine. Tight but mine. Beautiful floor, beautiful decorations. Han Golkowicki is with us, as well. No need to introduce that guy, he’s here for a reason. Because the car that’s under the cover, which we’ll show you in a moment… Is the car, to become the brand identity, that we’ll build with Han. But, I don’t f**ing know about the release date. Maybe, it’ll release when the brand is already on the market? No, probably not. I don’t know when this video is gonna come out. It’s f**ked up, how we’re recording this in September, and I don’t know if it doesn’t release in February! Or in 4 to 5 months. I’ll have a f**ing beard in that time. Children! I might have children by then. So, the brand connected with Han – you either already know about it or soon will. But, it’s gonna be very cool and around the topic which interests each of you, I think. Now, having these few words of introduction behind us… Come, we’ll take the cover off and show you the base, that we’ll work on. Looks cool, standing like that. Yo, check this out. This is one of the beautiful things about the R35. Back to order, though. First, let’s discuss the base, that I’m resting my ass on. It’s the R35 GTR from late 2018. This is a car, which interestingly, is in perfect paint condition. That’s because ever since it left a Polish dealership, it’s been wholly covered – including the roof – with a PPF. So, since it was new, it never experienced the streets. What can we say besides that, hybrid turbo’s, the whole MG Motorsport exhaust… And at the moment, 800 HP at 990 Nm of torque. Thus, a very fast machine. A 0-100 km/h in about 2.6-2.7 seconds, I think. Before us, programming this car the same way, like we did the Fame GTR. To have a true flame thrower on four wheels. However, that’s that about the base. Speaking of the body kit, we spread it out and you probably saw it already. Speaking of it, let’s consult the specialist. Who am I to speak. Lucas, by how much is this kit going to widen the GTR? By about 8 cm, we got 22 parts here and it’s a special kind of kit, because it’s the first…\\n(As you’ll see soon, that’s 8 cm EACH SIDE) That I designed all by myself. -What year came the idea for a GTR with this kit?\\n-In 2018. We made a small upgrade here, as we’re adding the Cyberwing… And also, we got the AL-13 rims, so that’s a really nice set. Alright, besides that, your GTR rode the air. Ours is gonna stand on standard springs, to keep it driving like the standard GTR’s. So besides it having a body kit, breathing flames and being the first GTR with a Cyberwing… Look, the same as the Liberty Walk Huracan. We got that wing, which in my opinion, is an absolute world-class masterpiece. We’ll be able to program it in a cool way. On top of all that, it’ll also drive. What’s interesting, Łukasz doesn’t require much time, because as we put the GTR here and you got the whole kit ready here… How long do you plan to take on this job? Installing the parts alone will be around 10 days, but finishing up with the electrics and suspension, should be about two weeks. To have it ready to drive. In my opinion, for such a drastic change of installing such a wide kit and all that… That’s an amazing time. I told you about the rims doing an amazing job in case of this car. Truly, the choice wasn’t obvious. -All the AL’s rims coming in…\\n-Are for you. Fire as f**k. I like that! Alright, let’s agree: Such a rim choice for a GTR… Isn’t one’s daily bread. -Looks cool.\\n-Looks amazing! The wheel appears to be very futuristic, very innovative. It’s an unobvious choice for a car like that. But, we decided for it, as in the history of this channel, we created dozens of cars… And keep on searching for even more creative and outstanding solutions. That applies to the rims, too, to draw people’s attention and have them wonder: “What even is this?” So, I think this wheel does just that. Here, we got the front rim and it’s already impressive, but look: The rim edge here is about half an iPhone. But, as we move to the back, we got a f**ing pot here. We could do a f**ing Letcho here. Just look, the rear rim’s edge isn’t half an iPhone in size. This is twice as big. Here, it’s an absolute Armageddon. What’s interesting, we could have had the edge even bigger, as the car’s shockingly wide. However, we chose it such way – not sure if you’ll see it through the camera, but the place where the edge ends… The rim curves concavely to the middle, so once we place the phone at the spot where the wheel is bolted… We got space for half of another iPhone, to reach the edge’s top. To show you how the rim fits the car and also by how much the car’s gonna be wider than stock… I think we could lift the GTR up, remove the stock wheel and install this one… It’ll show by how much the rim sticks out, showing how much the kit is gonna widen the body. -You can measure that with an iPad.\\n-A f**ing MacBook. Also, speaking of interesting facts, to install this kit... Like in case of most body kit, but not all – you got to cut the body up, right? Most importantly, we got to cut and protect the bodywork, to prevent leaks. Let’s lift it up then and install that wheel. To show the people what this all is about. The people – that’s you. You. We’ll show you what this is about. It’s quite alright now. Stanced, slammed, tucked, bagged. All good. An offroad GTR. I got another fun idea, hold on. Hand me the stool. Generally, come closer. Lukas has such rotating stools here. Now watch, what came into my mind. It isn’t that lightweight. It’s a bit heavy, the stool doesn’t want to rotate, but… Hold on, maybe I’ll do it. -Oh, so we’re now testing the driving looks?\\n-Yes, exactly so. I’ll wheel throw you an ashtray in a moment.\\n(La Buda Pottery Services) S**t, it’s sticking out a bit. Did we order the right one? Oh f**k! Oh f**k!! Alright, even I didn’t expect this here. Have we ordered it correctly? I don’t know if you ordered it correctly, because there’s no way in hell, that this is 8 cm per side. It’s f**ing 16. No, it’s… Don’t know what to compare it to. Has to be 20 cm. Yeah, yeah. Come on. -Dude…\\n-This much may hide. It’s gonna be wide. Nah, this is a wheel of the future. Wheel of the future. No, it’s as wide as my head. Han’s wondering if it was ordered correctly. A head each side. It’s gonna be like Huracan – left wheel touches the line and look for the right one, not to scratch on the curb. Gonna be the same thing here. Fire. Better and better stuff’s being uploaded for you, let me tell you, honestly.  Let’s start it up, because interestingly, it’s way louder than the Fame GTR. It’s got different exhaust valves and is much louder on low RPM’s. Sounds great, gotta tell you, it really sounds great. Alright, it’s cold so we won’t mistreat it. But it’s the same thing again, the interior of the GTR. We discussed it all before, when we did the Fame GTR. The center console, showing all these parameters. A fun fact is, that this exact GTR has been owned by us for 3 or 4 months, as of today. Just, everything we do on the channel – uploading videos for you, the trips, recordings, some events… Also, there’s a kind of queue of cars, which I wish to show you in certain order. Re-do them, build them and so on. The queue formed in such way, we’re only getting to this car after 3 or even 4 months now… Ever since we bought it. Alright, let’s not prolong. We got the whole introduction behind us, you got to know the project’s base. You got to know Łukasz, you got to know the whole body kit, that we’ll install. Now, it’d be cool to do something with all that. Leave a like, subscribe to the channel if you don’t already. I don’t speak redundantly, time to work abundantly. Upon installing the tire on the wheel, wheel on the car, and installing suspension to lower the car down… It appears, that it’s gonna be so much wider, that I can stand here. But, without unnecessary prolonging, my loves – a few days have passed. We’re free to get to cutting the fenders, bumpers, installing everything that’s coming to this GTR. However, the rear diffuser is huge. I can count on the boys – which side do I stand on? -This or that?\\n-This one. I’m the… How was he called, from Toy Story? Buzz Astral. What did he say, what were his lines? To Infinity, and Beyond! Or something like that, right? -Does it show how big this is?\\n-It does. Can’t talk now, we’re doing important stuff. I’ll call you back in a moment… We are… We’re cutting the fenders. Does it work? To Infinity, and Beyond! Or something! To Infinity, and Beyond! Watch out, you’ll hit something, wait! Hold on, I won’t hit anything. Yeah, sure. Watch it! F**k, if you fall down, I don’t know what our excuse is gonna be. “Why men live shorter than women” The door’s f**ing closing! I came in flying. Hold on, my phone’s ringing now. Krystian, I can’t talk now, doing important recordings. -We’re on a mission, yeah.\\n-Get it done, see ya. What will the neighbors say to that! From that side. These mosquitos are getting bigger. Alright, let’s get to serious work, because… Finally. It even flies! Alright, let’s remove it and get to serious work. If it isn’t flying with compressed air and removing panties… Those who didn’t see, let me remind you: If not that, I turn into Buzz Astral and run around the garage with a diffuser on my back. Got to have some fun around these cars, right? Yes or not? Yes. I hit something, gentlemen. We got it! What is it, the fuel tank? No, probably some screw from the inside. Do I cut through it? What, the blade? This won’t be an A, but you’re getting a B+. I got a B+ from Han! With a signature! Each time, I do better. Alright, seriously now – the first fender was cut, but this wasn’t our first cut off fender, from the cars, which usually aren’t cut. (LBWK Huracan build video) Throughout the channel’s history, we cut a few such parts. But, it’s the first time for a Nissan GTR. This is the memorable part, the first one to fall off the car. -Is this gonna stick out so much?\\n-No, hold on. F**k, I was scared it’d be sticking out so much. All four fenders were cut. Basically, we’ll be fitting the kit in a moment. Currently, the diffuser. It is really huge. However, I think you know that best from what we showed you. Makes an impression, it’s massive, really massive, huge. Heard that so many times. Now, I can say that with full conviction, too. Quite a diffuser. This is gonna be a completely different machine, now. Once we add the Cyberwing here… It’s over 210 cm of width, that’s wide. We only got a single semi-trailer that takes cars of such width. If we wish to bring both, we’ll have to do two trips. Or drive it. Or re-do the long one. Already, you got such an early view of what the car’s gonna look like, when ready. However, another fun thing… I move around this way, here. This look is also cool, just so you know – there’s lots of tape here, this isn’t fitted in any way, yet. The body kit isn’t even painted yet, just black, so it disappears a bit. The other nice view, moving so fast… I hit the wall. Sorry. This view here, look how it shows the perfect fit of the tire to the body kit. Notice, how nice the cars looks from this perspective. It looks like some GT3. Like a track-made Nissan. Nice, how we already got the large exhaust tips from MG. A bigger wing for sure, this one disappears completely. And that rim – matches the car like no other! A very unusual choice for this car, I said it already, but I’m 100% satisfied. It looks great and will look even better, once we add the huge, white, sporty letterings here. And the tire will sort of disconnect from the rim. So, that’s fire. I’m super delighted. And the car’s face! Once we take a look with this add-on… Looks aggressively, forget about the final condition, when it’s in correct color, and so on. And so on. Half a year ago, I bought a 2000 HP GTR.\\nWe’ll take delivery of it, now.\\n(We’re going to the USA) Are we really going to move from a small garage between Cracow and Zakopane, to Los Angeles in the USA? Am I really seated at the airport, waiting for a plane to California, because half a year ago, I bought a 2000 HP GTR? And during the whole season, we had no time to import it to Poland… Due to constantly recording content and doing lots of side projects, 7 days each week? -Yo, what’s going on? Thinking much?\\n-Dude, I was lost in thoughts. I had these… Didn’t know what was going on for a moment. I likely fell asleep, right? -But the USA. That GTR’s been waiting there for… When did we go to USA?\\n-Half a year ago. Half a year ago, in March. Seriously, now. The video now, we’re really going to the USA, California, just to record half of a video. With the GTR, we got to pick it up, put into a container and send to Poland. We got to have a 2000 HP GTR in Poland, right? That GTR, it’s from Illinois, Chicago. It’s currently being transported to California on a trailer. To record it under sunlight, for you. I’m still sleepy, you know? But, we’ll get back to the other GTR, between Cracow and Zakopane. We’ll have two GTR’s today. This is f**ked up, way too f**ked up. We’re doing just that, on this channel. Dude, this is the third location. The dude you see now, might be familiar to you – we share the name, we visited him during our last stay in the USA. He had that 2000 HP GTR, and so on, and so on. You probably remember. -So, they just stop in the middle and block the highway?\\n-Yes, they close it down. -And the people take the exit?\\n-No, they stop behind. -How long do they block it for?\\n-As much as they want. -And the police does nothing about it?\\n-Right! You got it all f**ked up in here! The jam was terrible. The traffic here, this f**ing Burgerland of yours lacks organization! We covered 800 meters in like 40 minutes. (???) Yeah, yeah. F**ing look! -One, two!\\n-And that’s it. Just get mine in, f**k the rest! Quiet, quiet. Give it, we’ll fit it in. There’s a big one there, too. We’ll fit the big one between the rear seats, don’t give me that s**t. It’s in. All the lenses f**ed up. Worry not, look! The big one will fit, too. -This won’t close.\\n-What won’t close? Here. -Somebody will sit on one.\\n-One won’t, come on. Where are you going, I’m the one driving! -Okay, but I got to back it out!\\n-Why you? We took one driver, to cut costs. We’ll throw it in the back. I did some math, the fact that we flew here, is one thing. Here, here. Here, friendo. Yeah, now drive your tank here. 3218 km – they did this much, one-way. -That’s f**ing extra size!\\n-How else could it be? You drove all the way from f**ing Chicago! We’ll park here. You gotta stand by the curb, this is the middle of the street, dude. Hello, friend! Do we leave it this way? No… Tiny. A bit “tainy”. A bit “tainy”, a bit of a dialect. Yo, what the f**k is this? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9... A f**ing 10 meter long trailer! And it’s plugged in, with 3 axles, too. What is this invention. They drove 3200 km for us to enjoy the sun of California. So, do we park it aside, to unload it? Doing it in the middle is a bit whack, isn’t it? Nah, in the middle. “We’re California”. -Can we?\\n-We can, everywhere. “We’re so”. -You sure?\\n-Yes, for sure. -So, we unload it in the middle?\\n-Yeah, why not. “Whay not”? So, turn that 6.6 liter off… And we’ll “unloud”. Let’s put it a bit aside, the guy who we’re renting the house from, will inform us of a complaint in a moment… That the truck can’t pass. The thing I said in the Lambo video! -What was it? I had my knee at the mirror’s level!\\n-Yes, yes, the knee. Were it to hit me on the crosswalk, the mirror would hit my knee. And in the USA, we saw cars, which would hit my head with their mirrors. Here, my head’s on the mirror’s level. Now, completely seriously. I mean, it’s all completely serious. It’s a bit abstract and even I’m totally shocked. But, they really covered 3200 km and truly, there’s a GTR inside. Truly, we’re then bringing it to Poland. And truly, the GTR was bought long ago. But, I’ll rewind you that story in a moment, so you can understand the Inception of it all. Now, that’s Perfetto. Come, Pete. We’ll f**ing open. Kamil said, you guys had an adventure regarding the fuel. He didn’t want to say it, stating it’d be better, if you tell it. So, we were in New Mexico. And the cold driver drove the truck. When I fell asleep… -Hold on, so you moved to the passenger seat, and he was driving?\\n-He drove. And you fell asleep. When I woke up, because we went off-road and stuff… I’m like: Where are we, you know? He looked at GPS and said: “Oh, we got no fuel left.” We had 30 miles of range, and the place we had to reach was 34 miles away. Let’s do it, I’m f**ing done. I heard some “uh-oh”. The guys are professionals. They’re looking for a key. We’ll find out, that the car passed so many kilometers, with the key waiting in Chicago. Peacefully chilling. Now, just to interlude for a moment, as we’re gonna unload the GTR in a moment, we’re here at Halloween season in the USA. The house is nicely decorated, there’s a spider, spiderweb, graves… Smells like someone empties their septic tank. That’s right, it’s got a parachute! Damn, it’s nice! Nice, nice! Haven’t seen it in a long time. It’ll look great on Polish roads. Let’s unstrap and f**ing unload it. All the neighbors of this quiet suburb of California, just found out… It’s not gonna be a peaceful week. -How do I enter it, through the window?\\n-Yeah. F**k. Basically, the magic that accompanies this channel’s making for years, starts now. And for all these years, I can’t logically explain it. I’ll explain what I mean, in a second. Let’s take it out of the trailer and see if it works. Right, suddenly everyone’s riding bikes, paused their work, dude’s walking his dog for the third time… The lady just happens to leave her house. We’re not the locals’ favorites anymore. Got to take it out somewhere. This takes up two properties’ space. What, is it loud? The neighbor was already leaving the… You know, she never saw such one before, just wanted to see. Sure it’s not anything else. You can tell it’s a bit re-fined. With good manners, though. Alright, dude. These bumpers are f**ing out for the post-lift ones. These are f**ing terrible. Why does it have ceramics? A GTR with ceramics… No, it’s cool, but you rarely see that, you know? Yo, wanna play Rock, Paper & Scissors for who stands at the back, while the other starts it up? No, no, no. My balls are f**ing important. There’s many examples of the magic present on the channel, which I mentioned. For example, many of you probably remember, how during our recordings in Hungary, suddenly and out of nowhere… A guy came up and said: “Come with me!” And took us to his spot for drift learning. Hold onto your chairs now, because the magic struck hard. Upon parking on the driveway, suddenly, the landlord messaged us: “Do your friends need the C16 fuel? I own race cars, too.” A bit of confusion, a bit of laugh. Basically, the E85 fuel which powers the GTR, is available at the American gas stations. So, we replied saying, we don’t need it. The dude says, he’d like to come and see it, because he’s a fan. We replied saying: Sure, what’s your ETA? He comes, we talk. The brainwashing starts now. Three weeks ago, I saw this TikTok – many of you probably saw it, too. Because it’s got 10 million views. It went viral. But, the basic question: Does this driveway look familiar? That’s right. Completely randomly, we chose this exact house out of thousands available. Just the one, that went viral on TikTok. We wouldn’t even realize, if the owner weren’t an enthusiast. Inside the garage, which is now an arcade room, he put a dragster together. All alone. A dragster based on the Camaro SS. He’s showing us photos, videos, scrolling through street races in California… Suddenly, he offers us to go with him, so he’ll show us his project. No need to persuade us, that’s absurd. But, we got to know him 3 minutes ago and we’re getting inside of his car. Grażyna, you asked me about what we’re recording today. We sat on the driveway and the video’s recording itself. Basically, the dude’s got 3500 HP here. He says that the blower is the same size as mine. And I’m f**ing shocked. I already know what that’s gonna be like. Much quieter! 25% of loudness, compared to the one in Poland. (Video on the Big Block from USA) The hand fits easily. Much stuff would fit there, after all. Look at these. -What, he says it does a quarter in 6.6 seconds?\\n-Yeah. -6.6 seconds is fast as f**k, isn’t it?\\n-Well, hard not to pull 6’s with 3000 HP. But, the regulations state, that if he were to race it… He needs two parachutes and the wheelie bar. Surely a wheelie bar and on the inside… He’s got an attitude from Golkowice, sort of. It’s a street car, he never did quarter mile races in it. That’s how we do it in Golkowice. Going to the mountains We begin the next day quite early, at around 8:00 AM we leave to a car wash, as the car’s super dusty. The car wash remembers the 60’s, more or less. But that applies to most of infrastructure in the USA, that’s what gives it such a vibe. The boss is cleaning the GTR in the back, while I will tell you, I never had such a jet-lag like this one. 9 hours backwards in Los Angeles. When I went to bed at 6:00 PM, yesterday… To catch some sleep before further, night recordings at 10:00 PM… I slept until today, 6:00 AM. A total of 12 hours. I didn’t wake up for the night shots, so I’m hopeful to get them done today. Let me tell you, regarding the recent pace of recordings, special episodes… Regarding the lottery currently happening for you. To have it buttoned down and maintain high standards. The pace is well capable of ruining and wasting me down. But, great things and great videos result from that. You, my viewers, are somewhat satisfied with that, I think. And somehow appreciate it, somewhere. So, we keep on going. That was a short, informative morning, as it’s currently 8:30 AM here. The neighbors were delighted, when we started it up at 8:15 AM. Truly delighted. The next stop is 6 miles further. The gas station with ethanol – E85. -They’re on the left.\\n-Where? There, behind the M3. We pass them and it perfectly shows the attitude of American police. You got a parachute in the back? The car screams like crazy? But, you don’t mess around and drive calmly? Keep driving, then. I love that approach, it’s just chill. Good thing they didn’t stop us, because the license plates we got behind the parachute… Are from another car. Such a side note. F**ing hell! You didn’t even kick it down! I know, but that’s f**ing crazy! This car’s really f**ing fast! Runs fast as f**k! -Why didn’t it shift?\\n-It turned the service mode on. -Not sure, if we should recalibrate the sensors.\\n-Of what? Clutch pressure? -Doesn’t want to shift.\\n-Yeah it doesn’t. Stop by the side, I wanna see it. -Meaning, you wanna drive?\\n-Yes, I want to drive it. -Come on, then.\\n-Now? Yeah. I couldn’t shift. What, is it broken again or needs recalibration? Needs calibration. Like you heard in short, we need to calibrate the clutch oil pressure sensors, in the gearbox. These sensors were replaced a moment before our arrival, as they started misbehaving a bit. So, recalibration didn’t load up, has to be done now. We hope it can be done remotely and that Kamil has a suitable cable to connect to the car’s ECU. Anyway, for today we planned going to Joshua Tree, 2 hours from Los Angeles. To record something really beautiful and the car in amazing surrounding. So, we’ll risk and drive there, to try recalibrate there, because we need space to really kick the car down… To calibrate it at high clutch pressure. Can’t really be done here, as it’s the morning and traffic in LA and around, is basically everywhere. It’s alright, friend. Why doesn’t it work? It’s broken again. Motorsport – expensive and no warranty. -Where are we, honey-bunny?\\n-On a desert. -But, is this some town or something?\\n-No, a desert. This is a f**ing desert? I see it’s some sort of town. -Does it have a name?\\n-Hold on, let’s check. You got to check it yourself! So, the town’s called a palm on the desert. Or a desert of palms. But, it’s very nice around here. Tell you honestly, this is one of the more charming and American-vibey places, I ever visited. It’s definitely prettier here, than in Beverly Hills. Anyway, what you see in the B-rolls now, is a really beautiful, American vibe to live in. I could live here, easily. I’d likely get bored to death and the people would likely disown me, due to the loud exhausts. But, I like it. Yet, the town is just a stop on our way… Because a lawyer, Kamil’s friend – John -  wishes to go with us. So, we stopped by to pick him up and brought the GTR to the place. We’re in Banning, around 1.5 hours away from Los Angeles. In a moment, we’ll be headed there. These mountains and behind them, there’s a town called Pinewood. There, I’ll be able to show you the GTR in beautiful scenery, and not just that. Here in the USA, we got the sound recorder, which will show you many fun things about the GTR. It makes really interesting noises, it’s very loud. It’s got no exhausts, the downpipes aim straight at the ground, right from the turbo’s… As befits the GTR, it sounds quite brutal, with lots of mechanical sounds, like the gearbox. In a moment, we’ll check if the clutch sensors work. We’ll calibrate them. Here, I went on about what we’ll do, but a malfunction awaits us. Didn’t know that when we recorded, but I do now. So, allow me to shorten the talk and get to the point. John the Attorney never sat inside a 1000 HP car, so what did we do? We sat him inside a 2000 HP one. Time to keep going. The plan is simple. Beautiful, mountain roads. Breathtaking drone shots… The combination of an iconic car and amazing views… Simply a dream. Until after half a day of f**ing hauling it here, the most idiotic bulls**t, that immobilizes the car, broke down. Nothing serious, we could fix it right away. But we don’t have a belt. Simple as f**k. You got some bad, f**ing luck with the cars. I never ripped the V-belt. Just a good driver… -The f**k did he say?\\n-He was happy. F**k me, this is such a bad luck of this car. Half a year ago, the f**ing unbreakable axle broke down. A front one! Now, the previously unbroken V-belt snapped, when I didn’t even f**ing push it, just drove culturally… Recording the content, nice views and everything. What are you doing to these cars, in America? Here’s the thing: Nothing. It just stopped. That’s what happens when you ask for 2000 HP. I don’t want 2000 HP, this thing goes like having 800. I got such one, that’s 800 HP and is quicker. Well, fast it is, when it drives. But it currently doesn’t. At the moment, even a lawnmower is faster. Don’t tell me, we need a semi-trailer for it, now. What else can we do? Won’t start. It’ll be ready for tomorrow morning. Also, the dude from R8 needs to get his ass kicked. Now, a shopping cart could smoke us. Right now, I’d smoke it walking. Not going there. Let me tell you, I prefer drones. Well, once they fall, you got to walk, too. But that’s a rarity. -It flew out nicely, though.\\n-Yeah. -With such little space to gain speed, amazing.\\n-The fact it made it, at all! Landed! On the wheels, just like that. -Yo, it did nicely just now.\\n-It was higher than you! -Did it show?\\n-Yes. The USA always leads to the same thing. (An hour later) You even broke the RC car. You broke the GTR, broke the RC car… -They sold you a lemon.\\n-Not just them. Then, he says the car broke down by itself. We carried it all the way back to LA and changed the V-belt. The procedure isn’t very complex, we initially call it a success. A test drive with our friend, straight from Dominican Republic. But, as they say in the USA: It is, what it is. Which means… Just that. -Did something break?\\n-No, nothing. -What is our friend doing, then?\\n-Don’t know, playing with the V-belt. With a second one, now! -Isn’t it loose on the power steering pump?\\n-No, it’s supposed to do that. No, that’s factory condition. -They release it this way.\\n-Oh, alright. Even if we stayed until midnight here, another V-belt’s gonna f**ing break. Belt after belt. A belt per day is alright. -We’ll refuel and change the V-belt, each time.\\n-Yeah. That’s right. F**ing alright! Auto Zone’s open until 11 PM. Off we go to pick up the next V-belt. We’re not giving up today, the R8’s getting its ass kicked! Heard that? Don’t f**ing laugh. -Friend, the R8 is still getting its ass kicked today.\\n-Right… I’ll sit here and eat this cereal. I bet something’s gonna break, when you’re back. Don’t open the parachute. Doesn’t matter if something breaks down or not. -Taking two more V-belts with me today and I’m out to kick R8’s ass.\\n-Yeah? Bet $1000? $1000. Hold on, I’ll call the shop and ask if they got these belts. -Hello?\\n-Hello. F**ing hello? Bet $1000? Sure, $1000. In a moment, we’ll have a change to proportions – two belts per each refuel. We’re out to buy a new belt. -I feel like the R8’s gonna kick your ass.\\n-Worry not. Look at that, that Auto Zone’s open until midnight! They got 8 f**ing belts! They’re sure to last until tomorrow. I’m out to buy a belt. Peter! We’re getting a belt. Midnight. Replacing another belt. We’ll make it. Move it, the GTR’s warmed up. -Got the Insta 360, Czaja?\\n-Yeah, already mounted. F**ing hell, to drag me over during the night, just for me to witness you getting your ass kicked by an Audi… Dude, you started it up like 20 minutes ago. The whole house’s shaking, I thought the chandelier’s gonna fall on my head. So, this is the GTR’s killer. Have a good look, to recognize its back. I see all well. I’m wearing slides, no f**ks given. You’re wearing slides, because you forgot to bring other shoes. Let’s go. Just bring the R8 out first, as the whole house’s shaking. Attempt no. 1\\n(Failed) -He bribed him!\\n-No f**ing idea what happened, the guy didn’t go. We got no walkie-talkies, won’t find out what’s up. There he is. Attempt no. 2 First of all, that was fast. Second, it appeared like the GTR was at the front. However you put it, I’ll never lose here. If I lost $1000, then my GTR is faster than a 1500 HP twin-turbo Audi R8. But, if the R8 was faster, then I won $1000. -F**ing cool. Pretty fast, right?\\n-Yeah, I couldn’t turn the camera on time! And I was ready for it to be fast. Nice. F**ing hell!! I need my twin-turbo Liberty Walk Huracan to shoot such flames! Interestingly, such rolling races in LA, done during the night, have a silent approval of the police. Two cars are headed towards the highway. One of them with a parachute – that’s normal – and drag tires. The police knows all well, why they’re going there, because it’s daily bread here. But, if the roads are empty – they don’t care. I like it. The plan consisted of bringing the camera inside and tell you about the car… But trust me, dear viewer – it’d sound like I was speaking inside a freight train. GTR is now basically a legend. Ever since 2009, it’s a base for experimental rebuilds in thousands of different styles. You likely noticed, that this video is about two R35’s for a reason. That’s a perfect example, of how versatile this base has since become. In that time in Poland, the body kit parts are being painted. Lots of carbon, pretty fittings and mostly visual changes. In the USA, we’re recording a variant indifferent to unique rims, beautiful paintjob or the body kit… Instead, has a gearbox fully made on CNC, that withstands over 2000 Nm of torque. Different approaches, but the same hobby – motorsport. We already established, that the Godzilla is fast. If even the middle tune and no nitrous is enough to smoke a 1500 HP R8, there’s no doubt. We prepared a nice opportunity for you, to experience that car’s interior. I hope you’ll enjoy it and would like to quickly mention, that we’re able to deliver you such quality content, here on the channel… Thanks to how involved community we create, together. For example, how many e-books you’re buying, during this last event. This is a kind of mutual respect, because you take part in our actions… And thanks to that, we’re able to deliver the highest quality content to you, the motorsport enthusiasts. So, if you like it, stop by 7AUT.PL and get yourself a dope e-book, showing the backstage of creating the channel. In the same time, you got the biggest chances ever, to win one of the 7 cars, from my event… Or 30 side prizes. That’s a kind of product placement. If you wish to, stop by, you’re invited. First place takes the M3 plus the A45s AMG. We, however, move to the video’s highlight. Let’s begin gently, standing still. That’s revving under the supermarket. Alright, #2 please. A standing start. That’s f**ked up! #3 – we’re going 60 on the highway, then give it full gas. In the end, crème de la crème. You may wonder, the task got the best of our microphone. Actually, no. The ALS shoots like 3 machine guns next to each other. That’s indescribable. (Anti-lag) F**k! Thank you for attention, the best is still coming. Don’t repeat such stupid ideas, we do it, so that you don’t have to. Task codename: “Parachute” Two uncles from America promised you a high quality parachute in today’s video. It’s currently 2:17 AM, call it night time. Behind us, probably widely known Golden Gate Bridge. -There were none in California…\\n-They had no such Golden Gate Bridges in LA, but they do in San Francisco. So we’re here. It’s gonna be legendary. I’m absolutely serious, we came here to Golden Gate, to San Francisco, basically… Just to open the parachute here. That bridge was built in 1937 and I’m not sure if someone passed it with a parachute… But, 3 600 000 cars pass it each year. Yet, only this one does it with a f**ing parachute. Only. Now, I’d like to introduce our stuntman. -Don't (???) speak Polish…\\n-No, come on! Waiting’s impossible! You screw that! Alright, let’s arm the parachute and do it. If this works out, it’s history, you know? It’ll f**ing work! Do it then, remove! It’ll be ready now! Here you are, Pete. Take it with you, attach it to your head. Come on, it’s cold! It’s 2:30 AM and we’re gonna open the 2000 HP GTR’s parachute on f**ing Golden Gate… Alcatraz is somewhere over there, right? We don’t have a place to stay in San Francisco yet, but this could all change during the next two minutes. A cold and long water trip to Alcatraz. “Inside safe travels!” No suspicions. No suspicions – back then, we laughed about it. But had no idea, it would all change the next moment… And we could face: An entry ban to America, a night in jail or even being deported to Poland. However, allow me to explain you some stuff. Because if I left it like that, it’d be hard to understand. Especially, as they deleted part of our recordings from SD cards. The first key element is that, the bridge’s pedestrian paths are completely closed past 10 PM. We didn’t know that, so we were kind of left loose from the pick-up, on the middle of the bridge, and jumped the fence. Not because both left and right entry gates were closed for pedestrians, we simply wanted to save time, not to have to walk. We didn’t notice, that nobody’s walking on the bridge… Because it was a middle of the night, and the bridge is a few kilometers long… So we thought, if someone wishes to cross it during the night, he’d take an Uber instead of walking for a dozen of minutes… Especially, as it’s very windy on said bridge. Another key thing here is that, at the end of the bridge, there are such exit gates… There, some collision took place, an accident. And a few police cars were there. First of all, it’s huge. Second of all, just over there, just look at zoomed footage – these gates over there. These are such exit gates from the bridge. Kamil called a moment ago… -Kamil…\\n-There was some accident here, by these gates. -What will he do, then?\\n-It’ll be hearable as f**k, you’d have to move back to that construction. So, we’re walking between the first and second bridge spans. Just like you heard, there’s been some accident and the police is there. Therefore, we need to move back, so they don’t hear the parachute or the accelerating GTR. What the f**k are we doing? Just how f**ing crazy is this? And how huge this bridge is! -Huge, isn’t it?!\\n-I can’t cover it in a shot with you! Damn, there’s some “Follow” standing there already, or whatever that is. Some uniformed services. We’re ready. I sent you a location pin. -Before the second one, we’re way before the second one.\\n-Okay. Alright, let’s maybe move back a bit. So we don’t stand like douchebags here, when the police passes by. -Yo, look. That’s to catch the…\\n-People. Yeah, people. The “Follow” is backing up, hopefully not to us. Stop, don’t come here, please… Damn. Like I said, we had no idea about not being allowed to walk the bridge. So, we didn’t hide about being there. Quite the opposite, we stood by the fence, didn’t hide behind bars and so on… As it turned out, we couldn’t be there and it turned out, we’ve been spotted. So, the bridge’s maintenance car, that passed us a second ago, passed us due to not seeing us… Received information from the CCTV guy, that he should back up to us, to remind us of not being allowed there. I suppose many of you know, what happened next. The GTR already accelerating at the end of the bridge, can’t be stopped. It’s already speeding up, it’s inevitable. And 15 meters in front of me, there’s a bridge maintenance guy… Telling me, we shouldn’t f**ing be there! And I just hear it coming f**ing closer and closer… -He’s coming!\\n-Oh f**k! (Przemek and I)        (Bridge security) Did we just shoot a f**ing parachute, while arguing with a guy telling us, about being on a bridge... Yeah! That’s closed on both sides! He asked how we got here, and we jumped the fence after getting out of a f**ing car… And I f**ing pretended, that the flying GTR in the middle never happened!! That didn’t happen. Oh no, the police. We’re f**ked. -Do I replace the card, or what?\\n-Yeah. Trust me, if two cop cars approach you in the USA… It’s either gonna be a shootout or big trouble. And that was the case here. They told us to head right, but listen closely, as absolute Matrix begins. The cop cars, that turned around to reach us, after getting information from that guy, who we passed with the parachute equipped GTR… They freed up space for Pete to pick up the parachute and load it inside the trunk. Since it’s completely impossible to turn around on that bridge, these cop cars passed Pete, while going at us. Had they stayed there, the car would likely be scrapped! That’s the Californian law for such stunts, like opening a parachute on Golden Gate Bridge! That’s not a f**ing parachute in the middle of nowhere, but Golden Gate Bridge! However, we go where instructed. We also dropped a walkie-talkie in the water, not to be accused of having contact with him, all that time… We knew about being in trouble, so we switched the camera’s SD card. The card with all the parachute content was hidden inside a sock and shoe. However, we quickly shoved in another card, which we filled with a few photos, to show we only went there to take pics. Speaking of trouble, we definitely weren’t wrong – trouble was there, huge trouble. We approach the end of the bridge, six policeman immediately show us to stop… With one hand on a cocked gun. Two of them approach us and immediately order us to place the camera on the ground. Then, immediately start searching us for guns, knives and so on. They run an ID check on me, so I hand them my document and they order me to go to the side. Przemek the Cameraman, however, has neither the ID nor passport on him. To prevent him from escaping, they put his hands behind his back and handcuff him… While reading him information, stating that: Everything he says, will be used against him. Just like from a f**ing movie. I’m already certain of huge trouble, they bring us to that bridge security building. They began interrogating us. Just to let Grażyna know of huge trouble and to have her call the lawyer, I began making up a story about intestines illness… That I need to go to the bathroom. That didn’t work at first, of course. I tried for 5-10 minutes. Lastly, after 10 minutes, one of the guards felt for me and took me to the bathroom. There, I quickly called Grażyna and told her, huge trouble was coming, to have her call the lawyer… That they’ll search us, we’re waiting for a police car, which is to take us away. They kept us like that, my loves, for an hour. They also took our camera, that’s where something really interesting happened. Namely, by deleting all the files from the card, all these fake photos, we supposedly wanted to take… They miss-clicked and began recording themselves, these cops. You’re seeing that now. They asked why there’s no recording of the GTR flying by with the parachute. Because they saw that on CCTV. And then, we said something that saved it all. Because we wanted to record it fly by, we didn’t know he’d open the parachute… And we didn’t record that, because your security guy approached and talked to us. So, how were we supposed to record that? (Like that) And they believed that. They told us to call the GTR guys and tell them to come, that they’ll be arrested. To give them their phone number – we told them, that we met them at a car meetup… That they only talked about doing a quick fly-by, but nothing about the parachute – we’d never agree to that. My loves, after almost an hour of keeping us, they let us go and… I’ll never, ever f**ing forget that day. -Well, such s**t never happened before!\\n-Dude, I was handcuffed. -Damn.\\n-F**k, I was certain it’d be: Search, police and jail. Yeah, right. By the way, I think the recording of me dropping the walkie-talkie was there. He watched all the files from yesterday. But, I showed him that the date doesn’t match and he wouldn’t check these. Because he began scrolling past that and the R8 races were there. So, as we threw the walkie-talkie, he saw that? He saw that and paused to see what we dropped out, if it wasn’t “the stuff” or something. Damn, dude! He approached me, and did it like: “Okay, guys!” -He took me like that…\\n-I know! -He didn’t handcuff me only because I handed him the ID.\\n-Yeah, I didn’t even have my ID with me. Damn… There it f**ing is. A fun fact – the next day, we swam under the bridge to see it during daylight. The f**er’s so huge and commands such respect… Had I seen it like that before the “Task codename: Parachute”… I’d likely cancel the plan. That’s that for our adventure in the USA. You may ask: Did we fly there just for a single part of the video? The answer is: F**ing of course! So, what else’s left, other than coming back home? A Polish-American video. Hello, homies! You might have forgotten, but we got this unraveled thing in Poland! Indeed, we flew to the USA to only record half of the video… Indeed, speaking of the white, 2000 HP GTR, the topic could be called exhausted. It’s currently being moved from America to Europe on a ship. But, when we recorded in the USA, the guys worked on this GTR all the time… To have it ready for assembly. Everything regarding the perfect fittings, carbon fiber, even the paintjob – that’s that. The car’s ready for assembly and because we wish to drive it on the beautiful, nightly roads of Cracow tonight… Let’s not prolong. Let’s throw all of that on the car and finish the project in a single video. I forgot to mention, in order to assemble that in one evening – follow me… Hello, welcome, welcome, my respects. This here is just the beginning, they’re there too. The whole army was called in for the task. It’s not usually possible to finish such stuff in a single evening. Łukasz, will we drive it tonight? -In two hours.\\n-Alright. Cool. This man’s positive attitude appeals to me so much… I've simply practiced it, already. A group of kids sat in freezing cold, so I announced a competition Oh s**t! Follow me. Come on inside, form a row. One, two… I’m offering 50 EUR for describing the thing you see here, in a single sentence. The best sentence wins 50 EUR. Our friend’s got a second to think. -The best car in the world, GTR.\\n-Good. It’s really cool, I like it very much. -You?\\n-A very beautiful wonder. -You?\\n-It’s wonderful.\\n-Well, that’s… Our contestants likely got stressed and didn’t do their best -None of you succeeded, 25 EUR for you...\\n-Thank you. -For you, for you… Here, buy yourselves some sweets.\\n-Thank you very much! No need to thank me. Here, our friend gets 50, as he’s the smallest. None of you did well. Nothing too crazy, let’s keep going. Yo, Łukasz? Didn’t you get a bit f**ing carried away? -No, this is the smaller one.\\n-Smaller than the one you had? Mine reached up here, but we cut it off, impossible to drive. -It sticks out a f**ing lot!\\n-You just place your hot dog buns here and warm them up. It now sticks out, like in some GT3… Lemans. -It isn’t big.\\n-Isn’t f**ing big? No, it’s modest, tiny. I wanted to say, more like draw attention, to something hard to notice with a naked eye. But, all the screws used by Lucas are laser cut. With CRBNRE on them. That’s the company, that’s the brand. -Yes or not?\\n-Right. -Right?\\n-Yes. We put it in, screw it in and we’ll have the wing in no time. When we do, it’ll match the diffuser – it’ll be neat – that’s what Łukasz says. I don’t know. Now, it’s a bit like lacking eyebrows, come on. It’s like having huge f**ing moustache and no eyebrows. But it’ll get eyebrows in a moment and be beautiful. We support small, Polish endeavors and companies, to let them pay taxes. But, I’ll show you something interesting – look, there’s the whole electrics, cables. Because the wing’s gonna light up. If the wing is to light up, it needs electricity. If it needs it, then it needs cables. And we’re not gonna drive around with such cables. We’re not gonna guide them through the body either, take a look. This is like, the wing support. That’s how it is mounted to the body. Watch, how Łukasz drilled a hole on the inside. Said hole is like a solution from RC cars, there’s such a sleeve on the inside. We have to guide all the cables through, nicely. They’ll be completely invisible, while delivering power like crazy. Lift it up somehow. Come on… That’s the idea, technology and engineering. Amazing, Polish exertions. They do it well. It’s all done alright. Let me shake your hand again. Just two more cables now, it’ll be tight. Get something for an easier fit. Damian always recommends WD-40. Do we have some WD-40 here? I could f**ing use some, to make it slide in easier. Oh s**t, I won’t enter here. A bit of WD-40 like the boss suggested, needed a little push and we got immediate results. Not one McMeal shall fit here. Can’t deny that. When I was a kid, it’s not that I hadn’t such a TV – I hadn’t such a table in the kitchen! Not only is it carbon fiber, huge and could eat from it… You could sit here… -I heard it’s alright to jump on yours.\\n-You may try. -Will these mounts really withstand standing on them?\\n-We’ll see. -So, Łukasz. Do you recommend to begin stress tests with some child?\\n-I mean, whatever you like. I don’t know. -How much do you weigh?\\n-Around 80 kg. Around 80 kg?! We’re getting a child, come on. Can you organize some child? Sure. It’s waiting outside, there’s a queue. Then you, then me. If it survives me, it’ll survive everything. Hi, we’re choosing you. Come. You’ll be the best, come, come. We need to do it in order. Worry not. How much do you weigh? I don’t know, 38 kg? Alright, hand me the… Watch it, 3… 2… 1! -How is it?\\n-Nice! Oh, you madman! Did you see, what you’ve done with your feet? It lit up. Check it out, 40 kg. Now it’s your turn. -Will you place me there, too?\\n-Not you… We got the ladder for you. Oh s**t! Alright, alright! Don’t swing, don’t swing! I’m… For now, 102 kg, easily. 102 kg?! I thought you weighed less! Oh, man! Damn! F**ing of course! Yo! You did it, man! 102 kg and it lights up! Anyone wants to join? Come here, little one! No, alright, no, no! No, we could fall down. But I feel, like I could hold him, too. You did it, brother! The way it should be! Didn’t expect that. Like I said, we support small, tiny Polish enterprises. We’re not gonna shoot it too much in here, as I promised you, we’d do that in the city. However, you may take a look – that’s f**ing crazy. All I wanted to say. -Lucas, how do you like it?\\n-It looks like my ex. -Brings back memories?\\n-That’s right. A piece of history. Nice to hear. I like this car. The only thing, I’m gonna complain about – we need to add a spacer at the front. -Don’t know, whose job was to calculate these wheels’ ET?\\n-The Americans. I didn’t calculate that. Alright. Anyway, it surely needs another centimeter, to be perfect and si qu'a la font. But, we need to order such a spacer and replace these wheel hub bolts. The car from the back, however – f**ing hell! Not sure if you weren’t carried away, it’s f**ing crazy, man. You could lay down here, sideways. Looks amazing. That’s so aggressive, the look, right?! Show them, amazing! -Damian! What will you say, Han?\\n-Super fire. -You’re so talkative.\\n-No, just… But here… What else… What else can be said? You already said it, it’s so amazing, that… The fascinating offense on this video’s logic is that, this is just the half of it all, you know? That, there also was the other GTR with 2000 HP. And now, we’re gonna bring it outside, because why not? Let’s do it here, too. Let’s show you that. Those of you, who watch till the end. -Your wing didn’t light up, right? The Cyberwing wasn’t there, back then?\\n-Yes. -And had the lower wing?\\n-Lower and the rims were a bit more straight. These AL’s are cool. F**ing hell, look at that. That’s a millimeter tight fit, right? There’s not a single centimeter on left or right, it’s like the Liberty Walk Huracan, if not wider by a centimeter. I’m super stoked about it. Good evening, I'd like a cheeseburger. I wish you, my lovely viewer… Doesn’t matter if you’re a turbo fan of JDM, Italian cars or maybe American. Or maybe German. To have your dream car - Just like I got my dream car of the childhood, the Nissan GTR… To drive it to McDonald’s, turn your Cyberwing on… And place your order on the huge wing. Then eat it. It isn’t all that impossible. The video slowly comes to an end… And I, my dear, lovely viewer… Invite you to 7AUT.PL – it’s such a simple website. You buy an e-book, which by the way, is an amazing thing. You greatly support the channel and also, you can win a car. Now, listen to this. It’s not even about the 7 cars, not about the e-book. It’s not about the possibility to win. This GTR didn’t cost as much as it might seem – despite what you think. Such a GTR as a base for a project, can be had for 64… Call it 80 or 91 thousand EUR for a post-lift version. Of course, that isn’t cheap. The body kit, wheels… Let’s include the exhaust, ECU tuning, maybe something from the interior. Let’s even count that as 23 000 EUR. Allow me to remind you, that the main prize at 7AUT is the M3 and the A45s AMG. Together, well over 230 000 EUR. Second place – the RS6. Don’t want it? You may sell it. You could buy a flat for that. You can build such a GTR and buy a flat. Even the new Toyota Supra, which, let me remind you – will be drawn during the first five minutes of the livestream. I invite you homies very much and hope, I brought you real quality content today. Truly, we recorded this for many months… While we did f**ing crazy stuff in the USA, the car was being assembled here, so I could present you two GTR’s in a single video. Wish you all the best, logging off and thank you all, for participating in our event this much. It’s dope! This is the last event in our history, so I invite you very much. Now simply, to put it in one word, shortly… Two words, actually. Thank you. Have a good one, logging off and good luck to each of you, individually. -Do you like it?\\n-A lot! -Nice as f**k?\\n-Yeah! -You playing for any of the cars?\\n-Actually, no.\\n-You should! -Do you, gentlemen?\\n-We do! -Do you?\\n-We do. -Now…\\n-Hi! There’s such a GTR, take a look. Let’s assume, you win the M3 and A45. You sell one of the two and build one like this. Let me tell you, your voice is kind of convincing. I don’t think it’s my voice, think it’s him! -Dope, isn’t it?\\n-Great! -How much out of 10? Without a 7.\\n-F**ing 100. Dude. -So, the 7 wasn’t needed.\\n-Wasn’t needed. The scale was too small. So, would you prefer this one or the new A45s? -This one.\\n-This one, right?\\n-Sure. -Now, the Touring M3 or this one?\\n-You know, this one. Oh you! My blood! Can we have that photo? Yeah, sure. A memorial photo and we’re f**ing off. The homegirl will do it for us. Come on, then. I’ll stand in the middle and you come here. -Wish you all the best!\\n-Same to you! Keep tight. Smile!\",\n",
       " \"Why did you decide to come here to Poland to see and visit Katowice? What was the reason? Yes, for us, apart from volleyball, it was of course a great opportunity to come to Poland and see different cities. So far we've had a really great tour, we've seen old parts of the city and completely new ones. We learned about the culture and, of course, we had a taste of good Polish food. Exactly. What will remain in your memory from this country?  Well, the memories are definitely, of course I hope, a very nice match and a very nice meeting with Polish volleyball. And on the other hand, of course, cultural experiences, as I mentioned, and food. Also what the city looks like and what the spirit of life in Poland is like. Learning about culture. These are truly the memories I want to take with me from here. Referring to the tour here in Poland, in Katowice - is there anything that will remain in your memory forever? Especially housing estates. I like it a lot. I also think the story behind them is very exciting. Would you come to Poland again? Yest, for a more detailed insight. With pleasure, yes.

Welcome to a new video on my channel I'm Xavi Luque if you like the content of the channel, don't forget to subscribe at the bottom where the description or the button that I will leave you above I will continue reacting to the videos that were seen in Eurovision TV 2022 I'm going with Poland 🇵🇱. I have had the channel a little quite forgotten. But it's just that I'm running out of time And now with 3 days of celebration for Sant Joan I've had a while. Let's go with Ochman, River and Poland! The effects! That obviously Being live I couldn't see them What a voice Ochman has! Wow the falsetto! It has some bass and treble ... spectacular! And how handsome he is! What eyes he has The proposal is very good But it is true that the dancers are a bit misleading And the cameraman who is not quite as good as he should be For a show like this. The plans could be much better What it said. This part is very chaotic With the dancers You pay more attention to them than to Ochman But what a voice!!! Wow Well spectacular Ochman's voice. For me one of the best male soloists of 2022 One of the best positions achieved by Poland And it could have been better For my taste! But this is the level that Poland should take. As I was talking to a Polish friend of mine, Lukas. In the Junior they have some impressive singers I don't know if you have seen Sara James in the Junior last year She has won the gold button in America's Got Talent By Simon Cowell .. Brutal! Brutal that woman, well that woman. That girl! Because I think she is 13 years old . I hope to see her from Junior to Senior in a few years . Because she is impressive . So far the reaction to Poland. We will continue in the next video. If you liked it, give it a LIKE AND SUBSCRIBE\",\n",
       " 'Hello, Warsaw! (Applause.) Witaj, Polsko!\\n(Applause.) Mr. President; Mr. Prime Minister; Madam Mayor;\\nheads of state and government, past and present -- including the man who jumped that shipyard\\nwall to lead a strike that became a movement, the prisoner turned president who transformed\\nthis nation -- thank you, Lech Walesa, for your outstanding leadership. (Applause.) Distinguished guests, people of Poland, thank\\nyou for your extraordinary welcome and for the privilege of joining you here today. I\\nbring with me the greetings and friendship of the American people -- and of my hometown\\nof Chicago, home to so many proud Polish Americans. (Applause.) In Chicago, we think of ourselves\\nas a little piece of Poland. In some neighborhoods, you only hear Polish. The faithful come together\\nat churches like Saint Stanislaus Kostka. We have a parade for Polish Constitution Day.\\nAnd every summer, we celebrate the Taste of Polonia, with our kielbasa and pierogies,\\nand we\\'re all a little bit Polish for that day. (Applause.) So being here with you, it\\nfeels like home. (Applause.) Twenty-five years ago today, we witnessed\\na scene that had once seemed impossible -- an election where, for the first time, the people\\nof this nation had a choice. The Communist regime thought an election would validate\\ntheir rule or weaken the opposition. Instead, Poles turned out in the millions. And when\\nthe votes were counted, it was a landslide victory for freedom. One woman who voted that\\nday said, \"There is a sense that something is beginning to happen in Poland. We feel\\nthe taste of Poland again.\" She was right. It was the beginning of the end of Communism\\n-- not just in this country, but across Europe. The images of that year are seared in our\\nmemory. Citizens filling the streets of Budapest and Bucharest. Hungarians and Austrians cutting\\nthe barbed wire border. Protestors joining hands across the Baltics. Czechs and Slovaks\\nin their Velvet Revolution. East Berliners climbing atop that wall. And we have seen\\nthe extraordinary progress since that time. A united Germany. Nations in Central and Eastern\\nEurope standing tall as proud democracies. A Europe that is more integrated, more prosperous\\nand more secure. We must never forget that the spark for so much of this revolutionary\\nchange, this blossoming of hope, was lit by you, the people of Poland. (Applause.) History was made here. The victory of 1989\\nwas not inevitable. It was the culmination of centuries of Polish struggle, at times\\nin this very square. The generations of Poles who rose up and finally won independence.\\nThe soldiers who resisted invasion, from the east and the west. The Righteous Among the\\nNations -- among them Jan Karski -- who risked all to save the innocent from the Holocaust.\\nThe heroes of the Warsaw Ghetto who refused to go without a fight. The Free Poles at Normandy\\nand the Poles of the Home Army who -- even as this city was reduced to rubble -- waged\\na heroic uprising. We remember how, when an Iron Curtain descended,\\nyou never accepted your fate. When a son of Poland ascended to the Chair of Saint Peter,\\nhe returned home, and here, in Warsaw, he inspired a nation with his words -- \"there\\ncan be no just Europe without the independence of Poland.\" (Applause.) And today we give\\nthanks for the courage of the Catholic Church and the fearless spirit of Saint John Paul\\nII. (Applause.) We also recall how you prevailed 25 years\\nago. In the face of beatings and bullets, you never wavered from the moral force of\\nnonviolence. Through the darkness of martial law, Poles lit candles in their windows. When\\nthe regime finally agreed to talk, you embraced dialogue. When they held those elections -- even\\nthough not fully free -- you participated. As one Solidarity leader said at the time,\\n\"We decided to accept what was possible.\" Poland reminds us that sometimes the smallest\\nsteps, however imperfect, can ultimately tear down walls, can ultimately transform the world.\\n(Applause.) But of course, your victory that June day\\nwas only the beginning. For democracy is more than just elections. True democracy, real\\nprosperity, lasting security -- these are neither simply given, nor imposed from the\\noutside. They must be earned and built from within. And in that age-old contest of ideas\\n-- between freedom and authoritarianism, between liberty and oppression, between solidarity\\nand intolerance -- Poland\\'s progress shows the enduring strength of the ideals that we\\ncherish as a free people. Here we see the strength of democracy: Citizens\\nraising their voices, free from fear. Here we see political parties competing in open\\nand honest elections. Here we see an independent judiciary working to uphold the rule of law.\\nHere in Poland we see a vibrant press and a growing civil society that holds leaders\\naccountable -- because governments exist to lift up their people, not to hold them down.\\n(Applause.) Here we see the strength of free markets and\\nthe results of hard reforms -- gleaming skyscrapers soaring above the city, and superhighways\\nacross this country, high-tech hubs and living standards that previous generations of Poles\\ncould only imagine. This is the new Poland you have built -- an economic \"Miracle on\\nthe Vistula\" -- Cud nad Wisłą. (Applause.) Here we see the strength of free nations that\\nstand united. Across those centuries of struggle, Poland\\'s fate too often was dictated by others.\\nThis land was invaded and conquered, carved up and occupied. But those days are over.\\nPoland understands as few other nations do that every nation must be free to chart its\\nown course, to forge its own partnerships, to choose its own allies. (Applause.) This year marks the 15th anniversary of Poland\\'s\\nmembership in NATO. We honor Polish service in the Balkans, in Iraq and Afghanistan. And\\nas Americans, we are proud to call Poland one of our strongest and closest allies. (Applause.) This is the Poland we celebrate today. The\\nfree and democratic Poland that your forebears and some who are here today dreamed of and\\nfought for and, in some cases, died for. The growing and secure Poland that you -- particularly\\nthe young people who are here today -- have enjoyed for your entire lives. It\\'s a wonderful story, but the story of this\\nnation reminds us that freedom is not guaranteed. And history cautions us to never take progress\\nfor granted. On the same day 25 years ago that Poles were voting here, tanks were crushing\\npeaceful democracy protests in Tiananmen Square on the other side of the world. The blessings\\nof liberty must be earned and renewed by every generation -- including our own. This is the\\nwork to which we rededicate ourselves today. (Applause.) Our democracies must be defined not by what\\nor who we\\'re against, but by a politics of inclusion and tolerance that welcomes all\\nour citizens. Our economies must deliver a broader prosperity that creates more opportunity\\n-- across Europe and across the world -- especially for young people. Leaders must uphold the\\npublic trust and stand against corruption, not steal from the pockets of their own people.\\nOur societies must embrace a greater justice that recognizes the inherent dignity of every\\nhuman being. And as we\\'ve been reminded by Russia\\'s aggression in Ukraine, our free nations\\ncannot be complacent in pursuit of the vision we share -- a Europe that is whole and free\\nand at peace. We have to work for that. We have to stand with those who seek freedom.\\n(Applause.) I know that throughout history, the Polish\\npeople were abandoned by friends when you needed them most. So I\\'ve come to Warsaw today\\n-- on behalf of the United States, on behalf of the NATO Alliance -- to reaffirm our unwavering\\ncommitment to Poland\\'s security. Article 5 is clear -- an attack on one is an attack\\non all. And as allies, we have a solemn duty -- a binding treaty obligation -- to defend\\nyour territorial integrity. And we will. We stand together -- now and forever -- for your\\nfreedom is ours. (Applause.) Poland will never stand alone. (Applause.) But not just Poland\\n-- Estonia will never stand alone. Latvia will never stand alone. Lithuania will never\\nstand alone. Romania will never stand alone. (Applause.) These are not just words. They\\'re unbreakable\\ncommitments backed by the strongest alliance in the world and the armed forces of the United\\nStates of America -- the most powerful military in history. (Applause.) You see our commitment\\ntoday. In NATO aircraft in the skies of the Baltics. In allied ships patrolling the Black\\nSea. In the stepped-up exercises where our forces train together. And in our increased\\nand enduring American presence here on Polish soil. We do these things not to threaten any\\nnation, but to defend the security and territory of ourselves and our friends. Yesterday, I announced a new initiative to\\nbolster the security of our NATO allies and increase America\\'s military presence in Europe.\\nWith the support of Congress, this will mean more pre-positioned equipment to respond quickly\\nin a crisis, and exercises and training to keep our forces ready; additional U.S. forces\\n-- in the air, and sea, and on land, including here in Poland. And it will mean increased\\nsupport to help friends like Ukraine, and Moldova and Georgia provide for their own\\ndefense. (Applause.) Just as the United States is increasing our\\ncommitment, so must others. Every NATO member is protected by our alliance, and every NATO\\nmember must carry its share in our alliance. This is the responsibility we have to each\\nother. Finally, as free peoples, we join together,\\nnot simply to safeguard our own security but to advance the freedom of others. Today we\\naffirm the principles for which we stand. We stand together because we believe that\\npeople and nations have the right to determine their own destiny. And that includes the people\\nof Ukraine. Robbed by a corrupt regime, Ukrainians demanded a government that served them. Beaten\\nand bloodied, they refused to yield. Threatened and harassed, they lined up to vote; they\\nelected a new President in a free election -- because a leader\\'s legitimacy can only\\ncome from the consent of the people. Ukrainians have now embarked on the hard road\\nof reform. I met with President-elect Poroshenko this morning, and I told him that, just as\\nfree nations offered support and assistance to Poland in your transition to democracy,\\nwe stand with Ukrainians now. (Applause.) Ukraine must be free to choose its own future\\nfor itself and by itself. (Applause.) We reject the zero-sum thinking of the past -- a free\\nand independent Ukraine needs strong ties and growing trade with Europe and Russia and\\nthe United States and the rest of the world. Because the people of Ukraine are reaching\\nout for the same freedom and opportunities and progress that we celebrate here today\\n-- and they deserve them, too. We stand together because we believe that\\nupholding peace and security is the responsibility of every nation. The days of empire and spheres\\nof influence are over. Bigger nations must not be allowed to bully the small, or impose\\ntheir will at the barrel of a gun or with masked men taking over buildings. And the\\nstroke of a pen can never legitimize the theft of a neighbor\\'s land. So we will not accept\\nRussia\\'s occupation of Crimea or its violation of Ukraine\\'s sovereignty. (Applause.) Our\\nfree nations will stand united so that further Russian provocations will only mean more isolation\\nand costs for Russia. (Applause.) Because after investing so much blood and treasure\\nto bring Europe together, how can we allow the dark tactics of the 20th century to define\\nthis new century? We stand together because we know that the\\nspirit of Warsaw and Budapest and Prague and Berlin stretches to wherever the longing for\\nfreedom stirs in human hearts, whether in Minsk or Caracas, or Damascus or Pyongyang.\\nWherever people are willing to do the hard work of building democracy -- from Tbilisi\\nto Tunis, from Rangoon to Freetown -- they will have a partner in our nations. For in\\nthe struggles of these citizens we recall our own struggles. In their faces we see our\\nown. And few see this more clearly than the people of Poland. The Ukrainians of today are the heirs of Solidarity\\n-- men and women like you who dared to challenge a bankrupt regime. When your peaceful protests\\nwere met with an iron fist, Poles placed flowers in the shipyard gate. Today, Ukrainians honor their fallen with\\nflowers in Independence Square. We remember the Polish voter who rejoiced to \"feel the\\ntaste of Poland again.\" Her voice echoes in the young protestor in the Maidan who savored\\nwhat she called \"a taste of real freedom.\" \"I love my country,\" she said, and we are\\nstanding up for \"justice and freedom.\" And with gratitude for the strong support of the\\nPolish people, she spoke for many Ukrainians when she said, \"Thank you, Poland. We hear\\nyou and we love you.\" (Applause.) Today we can say the same. Thank you, Poland\\n-- thank you for your courage. Thank you for reminding the world that no matter how brutal\\nthe crackdown, no matter how long the night, the yearning for liberty and dignity does\\nnot fade away. It will never go away. Thank you, Poland, for your iron will and for showing\\nthat, yes, ordinary citizens can grab the reins of history, and that freedom will prevail\\n-- because, in the end, tanks and troops are no match for the force of our ideals. Thank you, Poland -- for your triumph -- not\\nof arms, but of the human spirit, the truth that carries us forward. There is no change\\nwithout risk, and no progress without sacrifice, and no freedom without solidarity. (Applause.) Dziękuję, Polsko! God bless Poland. (Applause.)\\nGod bless America. God bless our unbreakable alliance. Thank you very much. (Applause.)',\n",

It\\'s really important that you understand what you\\'re getting into with\\nthis residency process okay but we\\'ll get into that another time. We\\'re going\\nto focus on happy thoughts and new experiences \\nand not really dwell on this very depressing subject. Okay, so let\\'s just\\njump right on in. I\\'m going to share five fun facts about Christmas traditions in\\nPoland. Let\\'s just dive right on in with fun fact number one and that is\\nChristmas holidays in Poland is basically a three-day event.\\nThe 24th, the 25th, and the 26th. Now, the 24th is the most important out of all\\nthese days even though on the 24th, shops are open and people have to go to work,\\nbut on this day is the Polish Wigilia and that is your traditional\\nChristmas Eve supper and this year I got to attend my first Polish Wigilia. I\\ncelebrated with my boyfriend\\'s family and I just learned so many things about\\nPolish traditions that I just had to tell y\\'all okay. So number two, fun fact\\nnumber two. Let\\'s basically break down what a Polish Wigilia even looks like\\nbecause it\\'s so different than Christmas dinner with my family.\\nSo first off, the dinner traditionally consists of twelve dishes. I\\'ve heard\\ndifferent reasons for why there may be twelve dishes. The first thing I heard\\nwere that twelve dishes basically represent good luck\\nfor the next twelve months or the twelve dishes could have symbolized Jesus\\'\\ntwelve disciples. I guess it depends on whose house you go to, it might have\\ndifferent meanings. Okay, so you have these twelve dishes and out of all these\\ndishes, there is no meat. So even the pierogi, the dumplings will have like\\ncabbage and mushrooms. So the only thing that\\'s really served is fish. Usually\\nyou\\'ll find carp or herring at a traditional Polish Wigilia. So you\\nhave these twelve dishes. You have your carp, you have your herring, and also if\\nyou notice this beautiful tablecloth-- if you look under this tablecloth, you will\\nfind hay and this hay is to serve as a reminder that Jesus was born in a manger.\\nSo throughout this supper, there are just so many little things, so many\\nlittle symbols. One thing I thought was really cool is that everyone sitting at\\nthe table, but there\\'s an empty place setting. So if you\\'re expecting 14 people\\nto your Wigilia, then you would actually set a place for 15 and this extra seat\\nis-- I\\'ve heard different meanings for this and I\\'m pretty sure someone will\\ncorrect me in the comments below-- but I heard that the empty place setting\\nrepresents a place for the Lord and I also heard that this empty place setting\\nis for a lost stranger or lost wanderer who needs a meal on this holiday.\\nWe don\\'t do anything like that but where I\\'m from, all the seats are taken, so I\\nthought that was pretty cool. So that\\'s basically the set\\nup of the dinner, but one thing I noticed is that even the pace of the\\ndinner was different than what I was used to. Each dish wasn\\'t really eaten\\ntogether, so for example we didn\\'t have full dinner plates.\\nIt was more like little saucers and so the first course or the first dish was\\none dumpling and so everyone ate their dumpling, I mean it was huge. Everyone had\\ntheir dumpling, we ate it, and we finished. and then someone brought out pieces of\\ncarp and everyone got one piece of carp. That\\'s how we kind of like progressed\\nthrough the 12 dishes just individually which is so different-- so different than back home. For example, when it\\'s time to fix food in my\\naunt\\'s house, you get your plate-- a big plate okay, and you are putting on your fried\\nturkey, your ham, your ribs, your collard greens ,your butter beans, your corn--your cornbread... So you\\'re putting all of that on your plate at the same\\ntime and no one is doing this whole-- one at a time, I\\'m done.\\nOne at a time, are we done? type of situation. You get a plate, you park it\\nsomewhere, and you just go to town. So this was very different and\\nthat\\'s basically what a Polish Wigilia looks like all right. Fun fact number\\nthree, let\\'s go into something called Pasterka. What in the world is\\nPasterka? And this is-- It translates into \"Shepherd\\'s Mass\", if I\\'m\\nnot mistaken? But it\\'s basically a mass observed by Roman Catholics so some\\npeople will have their Christmas Eve supper and then they will go to church\\nat midnight or will be in church at midnight. Others will celebrate Pasterka, but in a different way. Maybe at a bar or a house party with family and\\nfriends but just know that at midnight another type of celebration starts after\\nthe Wigilia. So you have this long dinner that\\'s kind of like building up for the\\nPasterka celebration. Fun fact number four and we\\'re actually going to reverse\\na bit. I thought this was so intimate and like really bringing people together\\nand I wish that we kind of did something like this in my family but it is called\\nthe sharing of the opłatek and this happens before you even sit down to have\\nyour supper. An opłatek is basically this thin wafer similar to\\nwhat you would use for communion so you go around with your wafer to each person\\nin the room and you wish them peace and prosperity and you break off a piece of\\ntheir wafer, they break off a piece of yours and you eat it and that\\'s\\nbasically it. And you go to the next person, but what I thought\\nwas really cute is it wasn\\'t something just for the adults, even the children\\nparticipated so you\\'re like bending down to break the little child\\'s opłatek and you\\'re wishing them well, they\\'re wishing you well so I thought that was-- I\\nthought that was pretty cute okay and The last fun fact, number five\\nit wouldn\\'t be Polish Christmas traditions if there wasn\\'t drinking\\ninvolved so, for example, if you go to-- if you come to my house in South\\nCarolina for our Christmas dinner and we ask you what you want to drink? We\\'re\\nbasically going to offer you sweet tea, lemonade, or water. That\\'s what we consume with our Christmas dinner. In Poland-- at\\nthe Polish Wigilia, I was offered brandy or vodka and I\\'m not a heavy drinker. I\\ndon\\'t really like shots either. I like sweet drinks. I like mixed drinks, but you\\nhad to have some alcohol because the number of times-- the amount of toasts that\\ngo on during this supper is like-- I lost count\\nokay I pretty much lost count and so you\\'re constantly drinking\\nbetween these little dishes. At one point, I didn\\'t want\\nbe tipsy in the people\\'s house so I thought that I could be slick and go to  Pepsi only, no vodka or anything like that and when\\nit came time for the next toast, someone noticed that I only had Pepsi and they\\nsaid, \"Oh, does Jasmine not have alcohol?\" \"Why doesn\\'t she have alcohol?\" And I was\\ntold that I needed to have alcohol so yeah before we continued the toast, I had\\nto get alcohol and I had to drink. If you\\'re a lightweight or if you don\\'t like\\ndrinking, it\\'s going to be hard to be prepared because it\\'s strong stuff.\\nFor example, we went to my boyfriend\\'s father\\'s house and he pulled out\\nsomething called-- I\\'m going off of my memory but here\\'s the\\nbottle-- and when you pull out this bottle and then you do this... It burns. Oh okay, that shows how strong it is? And we have to drink this? Wait, wait, wait. What am I supposed to do with that? Blow it out, yeah? Oh, my dear. If you are setting the alcohol on fire to tell me how strong is and then want me\\nto drink it, that\\'s not something-- I don\\'t want that. I don\\'t want that strong of an alcohol\\nbut yeah in Poland, you will drink. You will have to drink, it is polite to\\ndrink. Those are the fun facts that I learned this Christmas. If you are\\nfrom Poland, and I missed any traditions, please drop them in the comment section\\nbelow. If you\\'re not from Poland, and you have unique Christmas traditions where\\nyou\\'re from, be sure to drop those in the comment section as well. I hope you guys\\nenjoyed the video.

looked 30 years\\xa0\\nago a simple poor postcommunist country but this\\xa0\\xa0 is how Poland looks today it is expected that if\\xa0\\nPoland continues to grow by 2030 it could surpass\\xa0\\xa0 the economy of United Kingdom in addition to its\\xa0\\neconomic rise Poland is building one of the most\\xa0\\xa0 powerful armies in all of Europe and is becoming\\xa0\\na powerful threat to the world's great Powers but\\xa0\\xa0 how did Poland manage to evolve so much and\\xa0\\nis it possible that it will fail to see how\\xa0\\xa0 Poland evolves so quickly we have to go back\\xa0\\nin time and see the country's history in 1939\\xa0\\xa0 Poland was invaded by Nazi Germany which marked\\xa0\\nthe beginning of World War II during that time\\xa0\\xa0 Poland suffered significant human and material IAL\\xa0\\nlosses more precisely 20% of the Polish population\\xa0\\xa0 was killed and the country was devastated these\\xa0\\nlosses had a serious impact on the country's\\xa0\\xa0 economy and development after the end of World\\xa0\\nWar II Poland was freed from Nazi occupation but\\xa0\\xa0 became a state under the control of the Soviet\\xa0\\nUnion in this context Poland adopted communism\\xa0\\xa0 during the Communist period the state nationalized\\xa0\\nmost private Industries and businesses leaving the\\xa0\\xa0 economy under State control but after the fall of\\xa0\\ncommun ISM in 1989 Poland faced the challenge of\\xa0\\xa0 transitioning to a capitalist system and opening\\xa0\\nup to the global economy this transition was\\xa0\\xa0 difficult because the country had no experience\\xa0\\nin the operation of free markets all these factors\\xa0\\xa0 contributed to the transformation of Poland into\\xa0\\na country with economic difficulties and outdated\\xa0\\xa0 infrastructure after gaining independence in\\xa0\\n1989 at that time no one would have expected\\xa0\\xa0 that in the following years Poland would\\xa0\\nevolve and reach what it is today let's take\\xa0\\xa0 a step back to the present and understand\\xa0\\nwhy Poland has been steadily growing and progressing in today's world Poland stands out\\xa0\\nas a shining example of economic growth and\\xa0\\xa0 development this transformation did not happen\\xa0\\nby chance it was the result of several factors\\xa0\\xa0 coming together to propel the country forward\\xa0\\nthese factors include smart economic reforms\\xa0\\xa0 Poland's integration into the NATO in 1999 as\\xa0\\nwell as a highly competitive and well-educated\\xa0\\xa0 Workforce in addition significant

product increased a remarkable 826 times\\xa0\\nwhich was one of the most impressive growth rates\\xa0\\xa0 in all of Europe during that period a pivotal\\xa0\\nmoment in Poland's Journey occurred in 2004 when\\xa0\\xa0 the country became a member of the European Union\\xa0\\nthis membership brought a multitude of benefits\\xa0\\xa0 Poland gained access to development funds the\\xa0\\nability to participate in European markets and\\xa0\\xa0 a commitment to adhering to European standards and\\xa0\\nregulations all of these aspects had a positive\\xa0\\xa0 impact on Poland's economy in summary Poland's\\xa0\\ncontinuous expansion and remarkable Economic\\xa0\\xa0 Development have been driven by a combination of\\xa0\\nsmart policies International alliances a skilled\\xa0\\xa0 Workforce significant infrastructure Investments\\xa0\\nand the opportunities presented by its European\\xa0\\xa0 union membership this success story has placed\\xa0\\nPoland in the spotlight as a thriv ding nation\\xa0\\xa0 in the modern world one crucial milestone\\xa0\\nin Poland's economic transformation was the\\xa0\\xa0 privatization of state-owned Enterprises in the\\xa0\\nCommunist era the government had ownership and\\xa0\\xa0 control over most economic sectors privatization\\xa0\\nchanged this by transferring these Enterprises\\xa0\\xa0 to private ownership this shift gave rise to a\\xa0\\ncompetitive free market for businesses and allowed\\xa0\\xa0 new owners to introduce fresh ideas and efficiency\\xa0\\nin running these companies Poland's move towards\\xa0\\xa0 privatization also opened its doors to foreign\\xa0\\ninvestment many foreign investors found Poland an\\xa0\\xa0 appealing Market because of its skilled Workforce\\xa0\\nand lower operating costs compared to other\\xa0\\xa0 Western European nations the arrival of foreign\\xa0\\ninvestments brought in not only Capital but also\\xa0\\xa0 advanced technology and valuable expertise all of\\xa0\\nwhich contributed to the growth and development\\xa0\\xa0 of the private sector in Poland this transition\\xa0\\nfrom State ownership to private Enterprise along\\xa0\\xa0 with foreign investment played a key role in the\\xa0\\ncountry's remarkable economic growth [Applause] Poland's location between Germany and Russia\\xa0\\nhas historically given it strong reasons to\\xa0\\xa0 form a strong military throughout its\\xa0\\nhistory the country has faced numerous\\xa0\\xa0 invasions divisions colonization and struggles\\xa0\\nfor Independence even today while being a NATO\\xa0\\xa0 member the historical memory of these events\\xa0\\nis still alive While most European countries\\xa0\\xa0 have benefited from peace dividends and reduced\\xa0\\nmilitary spending Poland has maintained mained\\xa0\\xa0 its military funding at one of the highest\\xa0\\nlevels in NATO after the Russian invasion\\xa0\\xa0 of Ukraine the country stepped up its\\xa0\\nefforts Poland declared its intent to\\xa0\\xa0 increase military spending to 5% of its GDP\\xa0\\nwithin a few years surpassing the levels of\\xa0\\xa0 any other NATO member furthermore Poland\\xa0\\nexpanded its Armed Forces doubling their\\xa0\\xa0 size to reach 300,000 soldiers and invested in\\xa0\\nacquiring thousands of Tanks fighter jets and\\xa0\\xa0 other military equipment in 2022 Poland ranked\\xa0\\n18th in the world in terms of military spending\\xa0\\xa0 and was among the nine NATO member states\\xa0\\nthat kept their military spending above the\\xa0\\xa0 required level of 2% of annual GDP Poland's\\xa0\\nambitious plan to develop the most powerful\\xa0\\xa0 land forces in Europe represents a remarkable and\\xa0\\nsignificant military expansion in modern [Music] history now let's see what Poland really produces and\\xa0\\nthrough which Fields it managed to expand so\\xa0\\xa0 much agriculture is one of the largest Industries\\xa0\\nin Poland which although it accounts for 3.8% of\\xa0\\xa0 the country's GDP and is responsible for 12.7%\\xa0\\nof Poland's Workforce the industry is largely\\xa0\\xa0 private as private Farms account for 90% of all\\xa0\\nagricultural land the country leads as the biggest\\xa0\\xa0 producer of potatoes and Rye on the continent\\xa0\\nand it's also one of the top contributors to\\xa0\\xa0 the global sugar beat production moreover Poland\\xa0\\nstands out as a significant producer of rape seed\\xa0\\xa0 various grains pork poultry eggs and beef this\\xa0\\nvariety of agricultural contributions underlines\\xa0\\xa0 Poland's importance in the farming World in 2019\\xa0\\nthe country was the fifth world producer of silver\\xa0\\xa0 the 12th world producer of copper the 14th world\\xa0\\nproducer of sulfur and the 14th world producer\\xa0\\xa0 of salt

       " \"U.S. ARMY INTELLIGENCE OFFICER AND NOW AND INTERNATIONAL SECURITY COLONEL, FIRST OF ALL, THAT THE PRESIDENT. WENT ON TELEVISION BALI. I WAS A LITTLE SOUNDED BY. I THOUGHT HE MISSPOKE BECAUSE HE SAID HE WASN'T SURE HE DIDN'T THINK THOSE MISSILES CAME FROM RUSSIA. MAYBE HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THEM COMING FROM BAYLOR, RUSSIA FLYING. MAYBE FROM. YOU FROM THE YEARS OUR OCEAN BASE TO LAUNCH. YEAH. I'M TRYING TO GET A READ ON WHAT YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT SAY ABOUT THIS. WELL, I MEAN, I CERTAINLY TOOK IT AS THEY PROBABLY WEREN'T FIRED FROM RUSSIA. WERE PROBABLY RUSSIAN IN ORIGIN. BUT THAT'S NOT SAYING A LOT BECAUSE MANY OF THE MISSILES THROUGHOUT THAT CASES THE ORDINANCE THAT RUSSIA AND HAS BEEN USING WHETHER FIRE CORRECTION TERRITORY FROM BELARUSIAN IS IN MANY CASES DECADE OLD AND THEN UKRAINIANS HAVE THEIR OWN A MISSILE SYSTEMS THAT ARE EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE RUSSIAN SYSTEM SAYS I'VE GOT THEM FROM RUSSIA WHEN THE SOVIET UNION BROKE UP IN THE EARLY 90'S. SO THERE'S A LOT OF VERY OLD ORDINANCE THAT WAS MANUFACTURED RUSSIA. BUT IT THAT IS FLYING AROUND THAT THEATER OF OPERATIONS. SO THAT'S THAT'S ACTUALLY. I WANT TO BOUNCE RIGHT OFF WHAT YOU JUST SAID, A LOT OF OLD ORDINANCE THAT'S BOUNCING AROUND THAT THEATER. I HAVE HEARD NUMBER MILITARY EXPERTS SAY TODAY IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE FIRST OF ALL, THESE THINGS ARE LOUSY. THEY THEY ARE ORDINANCE JUST CRAPPIE AIM AND THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE UKRAINE'S ACTUALLY WERE FIRING ANTI-AIRCRAFT FIRE AT THIS THING AND KNOCKED IT OFF COURSE OR BLEWETT AND PART OF IT, YOU KNOW, ENDED UP EXPLODING OVER THE BORDER. I GUESS THE QUESTION IS DOES THAT MATCH HER. AND I I ASK THAT BECAUSE IF RUSSIA PLAYING WITH FIRE THAT CLOSE TO THE BORDER. THEY KNOW WHAT COULD HAPPEN. AND YOU KNOW THE THING HAPPEN? SHOULD ARTICLE 5 B AND VOTE WHEREBY NATO SAYS, ALL RIGHT HERE IT'S ON. I THINK IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THE ARTICLE, 5 OF VOTE IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS, IT THE RUSSIANS HAVE FIRED SOMETHING DELIBERATELY AT INTO POLICE SHARED TORY ALBEIT RIGHT OVER POSSIBLE IF THEY'RE TRYING TO SEND A BUT IT'S EQUALLY LIKELY WE'RE PROBABLY MORE LIKELY THAT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT OF LOT OF THIS ORDINANCE REALLY OL IT'S NOT TERRIBLY ACCURATE, ESPECIALLY WHEN HE'S BEEN REPURPOSED FROM SYSTEMS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO DO OTHER THINGS. SO ALL OF THAT'S GOING TO BE FACTORS THAT ARE PARTIES INVOLVED IN THIS WHEN THE WEAPON TECHNICAL TEAMS ARE GOING TO GO IN THERE. THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE PIECES THEY'RE GOING TO TRY THAT WHERE PARTS REGIONALLY CAME FROM. AND THE INTERMEDIATE STEPS IT MADE IN ORDER TO GET WERE WAS WHAT UNIT SOMEBODY WHERE WAS STORED, SO ON AND SO FORTH. AND THAT COULD BE TIED TO OTHER SUCH AS THE RADIO INTERCEPTS WERE FROM OPEN SAY OR C A VARIETY OF OTHER SOURCES AND THEY'RE GOING ACTUALLY PINK THIS PICTURE. AND THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO DETERMINE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT TERMS OF WHAT THE NEXT STEPS ARE FOR NATO AND FOR THE UNITED STATES, MORE SPECIFICALLY. WE HAVE ABOUT 20 SECONDS LEFT. I HAVE TO ASK YOU BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE ONLINE SAYING IS THIS THE, YOU KNOW, ARCH FRONT AND FRANZ FERDINAND MOMENT THAT THAT KICKED OFF WHERE BEEN I'M SURE HAS ALL SORTS OF SMELLS OF ALLIANCE'S, ET CETERA. BUT IS IT? IT IS ABSOLUTELY A PROVOCATION. WHETHER IT WAS AN ACCIDENT OR DELIBERATE. IT IS SERIOUS AND NEEDS TO BE HANDLED AS SUCH, BUT BECAUSE IT IS POTENTIALLY SO DRAMATICALLY SERIOUS THAT JUST MEANS THAT MORE RESOURCES WILL BE POURED INTO MAKING ABSOLUTELY SURE ABILITY WHERE THAT MISSILE CAME FROM, WHO FIRED IT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS DIDN'T END UP LANDING IN POLAND. FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, THE RUSSIANS ARE DENIED TAKING ANY ACTIONS OUTSIDE OF UKRAINIAN BORDERS AS WE WOULD ONLY EXPECT THEM TO SAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. LIEUTENANT COLONEL JAMES HICKEY. GOOD TO HAVE YOU ON. WE'LL HAVE YOU BACK FOR SURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR\",\n",
       " \"how difficult is it to study a medical degree\\xa0\\nin Poland what would be your biggest challenges\\xa0\\xa0 would language be your biggest hurdle let's hear\\xa0\\nit to the experience of Dr Jennifer Castaneda\\xa0\\xa0 she studied medicine there passed the medical\\xa0\\nboard exam and is a practicing doctor and a\\xa0\\xa0 professor in Warsaw Poland [Music] hi Avic thanks\\xa0\\nfor inviting me over yes it's been worth the wait\\xa0\\xa0 so Jen my first question for you is how long\\xa0\\nhave you been in Poland well I came to Poland\\xa0\\xa0 in 1995 so that makes it uh 27 years 27 right\\xa0\\n well I started medicine in UP Manila\\xa0\\xa0 with the intermed program and I guess I was a bit\\xa0\\nof an idealist I didn't like the way some doctors\\xa0\\xa0 treated the patients in in the hospital I was\\xa0\\nin so I said well I think I'd stop medicine I\\xa0\\xa0 started Masters of Science in genetics in UP but\\xa0\\nthen I was given a proposal if I wanted to help\\xa0\\xa0 out in the establishment of center of formation\\xa0\\nfor women in Krakow and so well I decided to start\\xa0\\xa0 this adventure of coming over to Poland so in\\xa0\\nthe end when I was asked what kind of studies I\\xa0\\xa0 would push through I didn't have any other idea\\xa0\\noptions so so I said medicine so I went through\\xa0\\xa0 in intense polish program to enter medical studies\\xa0\\nin Krakow so I started medicine there I finished\\xa0\\xa0 it and then I did my PhD in another city it's\\xa0\\ncalled Szczecin in Poland and then afterwards\\xa0\\xa0 I actually went back to genetics because I did\\xa0\\nmy specialization in critical genetics in here\\xa0\\xa0 in Warsaw in The Institute of mother and child\\xa0\\nwhich is a public pediatric hospital and OB gyne\\xa0\\xa0 in hospital and that's where I'm working right\\xa0\\nnow as a clinical geneticist in our genetic\\xa0\\xa0 counseling unit so what is the beauty of Poland\\xa0\\nfor you looking back this is 27 years what is\\xa0\\xa0 the beauty of Poland for you as a professional and\\xa0\\nas a person okay well I would say um I'd probably\\xa0\\xa0 um direct these words to people who would have to\\xa0\\ngo to another place to study or to work I think\\xa0\\xa0 what gave me a lot of positive input in this place\\xa0\\nin Poland is that it is a place that's culturally\\xa0\\xa0 very close to my own and I like the way that\\xa0\\nbetween the Philippines and Poland even if you\\xa0\\xa0 know the climate is totally different if I could\\xa0\\njust show you and perhaps I will be able to show\\xa0\\xa0 you the snow that's now falling I see through\\xa0\\nthe window so the climate is very different but\\xa0\\xa0 cultural wise probably because of a very similar\\xa0\\nhistory of religion that there the Catholicism\\xa0\\xa0 is as in the Philippines also it's um it's the\\xa0\\nreligion of the majority here so cultural wise not\\xa0\\xa0 only religion but then it's a strong family ties\\xa0\\na strong interpersonal relationships so I think\\xa0\\xa0 this is very very valuable here in in Poland and\\xa0\\nI think it was a it's it's like a treasure that\\xa0\\xa0 that I myself was um was benefiting from what\\xa0\\nwould be your biggest hurdle especially in the\\xa0\\xa0 beginnings you're asking about this a big hurdle\\xa0\\nwhen you transfer to a different country and you\\xa0\\xa0 know that you're gonna stay there for a lot of\\xa0\\nyears aside from the challenges of the language\\xa0\\xa0 I think it's the confrontation with sometimes\\xa0\\ndifferent mentalities it could be in contrast what\\xa0\\xa0 you were used to before and I think how at least\\xa0\\nI managed with that is that I was always trying to\\xa0\\xa0 be at least very open to the differences but not\\xa0\\nputting so much attention into the differences I\\xa0\\xa0 think what helps is to look for the aspects which\\xa0\\nunite us like the universal values that we share\\xa0\\xa0 with people of different cultures and not to put\\xa0\\nso much attention into the differences to be open\\xa0\\xa0 to the values which you know you could even learn\\xa0\\nfrom them but I also thing it's very important to\\xa0\\xa0 keep your own culture your own tradition in their\\xa0\\nplace not to compare I just learned later on not\\xa0\\xa0 to say oh we did it in a different way in my\\xa0\\ncountry adapt yourself to how the people live\\xa0\\xa0 in this place because in the same way that you're\\xa0\\nlearning from others actually you are enriching\\xa0\\xa0 them with your own traditions your own customs\\xa0\\nand and your own ways of thinking did you have\\xa0\\xa0 classmates from other non-European countries\\xa0\\nwell in Poland actually because of the history\\xa0\\xa0 of Communism there were a lot of people from\\xa0\\npost-communist countries in my case I was the\\xa0\\xa0 only Filipino in in my batch and Asian I think\\xa0\\nI was the only one I had friends from Ukraine\\xa0\\xa0 Latvia mostly neighboring countries there are\\xa0\\nsome medical programs in English here so it's\\xa0\\xa0 a paid English program I was lucky enough to get\\xa0\\ninto the Polish program well the challenge is that\\xa0\\xa0 everything was in Polish but then there's still\\xa0\\nfree education here free University education so\\xa0\\xa0 that was of course of utmost benefit that I didn't\\xa0\\nhave to pay for my medical studies and actually\\xa0\\xa0 medicine here in Poland is in quite a good level\\xa0\\na lot of very good professionals perhaps it\\xa0\\xa0 doesn't have the modern Innovations technological\\xa0\\ninnovations not all of them like in the United\\xa0\\xa0 States or probably in the UK but there are a lot\\xa0\\nof a spirit of entrepreneurship and so I would say\\xa0\\xa0 even in genetics that some diagnostic methods\\xa0\\nin genetics which are now very much in use in\\xa0\\xa0 other Western countries are beginning to be used\\xa0\\nin Poland can you describe to us your experience\\xa0\\xa0 about the language what are you thinking about\\xa0\\nlearning a language is totally different from\\xa0\\xa0 your own because I remember when I was already\\xa0\\nplanning to go to Poland and I uh someone gave me\\xa0\\xa0 a text from a new polish newspaper and I couldn't\\xa0\\neven pronounce the words because there are so many\\xa0\\xa0 consonants in the world in the you know there\\xa0\\nare a lot of s z dz together in in the Polish\\xa0\\xa0 language is and why it's like a vowel if you think\\xa0\\nof it as a consonant you couldn't read the words\\xa0\\xa0 but anyway what I was thinking in general I think\\xa0\\nwhat helped me was not to be such a perfectionist\\xa0\\xa0 because I know of some people who are like they\\xa0\\nwould only speak the language if they knew that\\xa0\\xa0 they had it in a perfect State I mean that they\\xa0\\nwouldn't commit errors and I think that's a very\\xa0\\xa0 erroneous way of trying to learn a language in\\xa0\\na country where you know that you will live for\\xa0\\xa0 for many more years so I think what helped me was\\xa0\\nactually I was advised to do that just you know\\xa0\\xa0 just to go ahead just to speak with people and\\xa0\\neven if you know that you'll make some errors I\\xa0\\xa0 had a lot of friends who were very very patient\\xa0\\nwith me that when there was a there was a word\\xa0\\xa0 in in the lecture in Biochemistry that I didn't\\xa0\\nunderstand I always had my friend beside me was\\xa0\\xa0 always explaining to me so not to get frustrated\\xa0\\nthat you don't grammatically speak so well in\\xa0\\xa0 the beginning the other thing is that learning a\\xa0\\nlanguage takes a lot of energy from the neurons\\xa0\\xa0 but also helped me is that to take some breaks\\xa0\\nI mean to sometimes read something in English\\xa0\\xa0 or talk to someone in English so that then the\\xa0\\nneurons don't get so exhausted someone was saying\\xa0\\xa0 that you already know you're speaking fluently\\xa0\\nor at least this language is a bit more in your\\xa0\\xa0 nature when you start dreaming in this language\\xa0\\nor when you start counting in this language\\xa0\\xa0 spontaneously and I think that's just really\\xa0\\nwhat happened it's good that you talked about\\xa0\\xa0 not being a perfectionist what is the difference\\xa0\\nbetween striving for perfection and perfectionism\\xa0\\xa0 that's very difficult question you posed to me but uh when I think about\\xa0\\xa0 it and I thought about it a lot recently also\\xa0\\nbecause I forgot to tell you that but I was very\\xa0\\xa0 much interested in bioethics and so apart from\\xa0\\nclinical genetics I actually did some training\\xa0\\xa0 in bioethics and now I'm in a master program\\xa0\\nin global by ethics because I do organize some\\xa0\\xa0 bioethics seminars for students and so talking a\\xa0\\nlot with young people then you see that there's\\xa0\\xa0 a tendency towards perfectionism in the way even\\xa0\\nthe educational process is being led like in the\\xa0\\xa0 universities or even in school so the difference\\xa0\\nbetween striving for perfection and perfectionism\\xa0\\xa0 when I think about it well I wouldn't say I'm a\\xa0\\nI'm an expert on the field but I think striving\\xa0\\xa0 for perfection includes in the process some\\xa0\\nstages of failures a person who's not\\xa0\\xa0 a perfectionist would take advantage of these\\xa0\\nlittle or big failures to move towards the aim\\xa0\\xa0 without getting frustrated the idea here is to\\xa0\\ntreat these failures as a challenge to actually\\xa0\\xa0 change something in the process or to grow in some\\xa0\\nother I don't know in virtues in in some values\\xa0\\xa0 but keeping the aim in mind so a perfectionist\\xa0\\nI think what happens that's why there's some\\xa0\\xa0 kind of frustration is that they don't know how to\\xa0\\nmanage these stages of failures or imperfections\\xa0\\xa0 which have to be accepted as I think part of the\\xa0\\nprocess towards achieving a name one good thing\\xa0\\xa0 is that to know how to ask for help actually\\xa0\\nto admit that we can't perfectly go towards an\\xa0\\xa0 objective just we ourselves and so to know how\\xa0\\nto ask for help and to appreciate the help that\\xa0\\xa0 you are being given and the support that comes\\xa0\\nfrom the environment friends family could you\\xa0\\xa0 give us a little explanation for dummies\\xa0\\nof what is genetics and what is bioethics\\xa0\\xa0 I'm so lucky actually I consider myself a very\\xa0\\nlucky person that I'm into these fields which\\xa0\\xa0 are I would say they're very specific in the\\xa0\\nsense that not everyone likes genetics for\\xa0\\xa0 instance clinical genetics as a field of medicine\\xa0\\nyou deal with very rare diseases genetic diseases\\xa0\\xa0 so there's a lot of going to the molecules here\\xa0\\nI mean the genetic basis of diseases which now\\xa0\\xa0 actually includes the very various you know other\\xa0\\nfields of specialization because there's genetics\\xa0\\xa0 in Pediatrics in neonatology in Gynecology and OB\\xa0\\ngyne there's genetics in dermatology and oncology\\xa0\\xa0 and all that the thing is that really when you\\xa0\\ndiagnose genetic diseases it's not the type that\\xa0\\xa0 you can say okay I have diagnosed this disease\\xa0\\nand I can cure you in the case of genetics they\\xa0\\xa0 are usually rare incurable diseases but it's\\xa0\\na different kind of support that geneticists\\xa0\\xa0 give to families In which genetic diseases are\\xa0\\ndiagnosed um I would say it's more support like\\xa0\\xa0 giving more much more information on this rare\\xa0\\ndisease which is very difficult to know so much\\xa0\\xa0 about it because other other doctors would would\\xa0\\nknow less probably because they're very rare the\\xa0\\xa0 kind of psychological support or to give them more\\xa0\\ninformation on what could be the surveillance in\\xa0\\xa0 the case of a child with a genetic disease so\\xa0\\nit's difficult to cure quite impossible in most\\xa0\\xa0 genetic diseases but you can care for someone in\\xa0\\na different way and bioethics is actually a field\\xa0\\xa0 which is of course not only tied to genetics but\\xa0\\nto all different fields of biological sciences and\\xa0\\xa0 bioethics is keeping the person the good of the\\xa0\\nperson in mind bioethics is a part of philosophy\\xa0\\xa0 and I think when one is involved in such a very\\xa0\\nmolecular field like genetics bioethics gives\\xa0\\xa0 the professional a wider perspective because it\\xa0\\nmakes you go from the molecules to the person\\xa0\\xa0 the person himself or bioethics deals with the\\xa0\\nethical aspects of biological sciences and I\\xa0\\xa0 would say that in genetics there's a lot of it how\\xa0\\nyou use the genetic technology how you diagnose\\xa0\\xa0 for instance fetuses during the prenatal period so\\xa0\\nthere's a lot of a lot of different areas actually\\xa0\\xa0 when you said from molecules to person I totally\\xa0\\nunderstand it now very simple for dummies really\\xa0\\xa0 so there are only four more minutes and Dr Jen has\\xa0\\nto go to another appointment so my last question\\xa0\\xa0 would be if there are some professionals who\\xa0\\nare moving to another country for professional\\xa0\\xa0 development for Graduate Studies like what you\\xa0\\nhave experienced what would be your top three\\xa0\\xa0 advices for them first to keep the aim in mind\\xa0\\nwhy we're going to another place then I think\\xa0\\xa0 to keep this objective in mind it helps us to\\xa0\\ngo through the process of the hurdles to the\\xa0\\xa0 difficulties in order to reach the aim at the\\xa0\\nsame time is to accept that there will be some\\xa0\\xa0 difficulties to accept that that's part of the\\xa0\\nprocess and to admit it to people and to take\\xa0\\xa0 advantage and be thankful for the support that\\xa0\\nother people can give so that's what the second\\xa0\\xa0 is to be very open to the differences in culture\\xa0\\ncustoms traditions and to try to see what is very\\xa0\\xa0 positive in these differences that we see and\\xa0\\nthe third is probably to take care of oneself you\\xa0\\xa0 know a very hygienic way of life that means to\\xa0\\nknow how to rest to know how to take care of\\xa0\\xa0 friendships of interpersonal relationships to\\xa0\\nbe in touch with one's family so I think that's\\xa0\\xa0 what I would say avic thanks so much for for the\\xa0\\ninterview and it was wonderful to be chatting with\\xa0\\xa0 you on this Sunday evening there morning here and\\xa0\\nwe have a very blessed Christmas to all of you if\\xa0\\xa0 you like this video you better watch this and\\xa0\\nalso this other one don't forget to subscribe\\xa0\\xa0 click the

celsius\\napproximately during the daytime and during night it's around 11 to 13\\ndegrees and it's quite rainy here you can see and\\nyes until last week it was horrible horrible summers and it was quite\\nhot here also so now we are feeling a little better and\\nit's quite pleasant but now it seems it's going to rain\\nso me and ketan are going to rush to this supermarket and\\nyou guys enjoy this video and i hope this will be informative as well for you\\nand yes let's go many of you guys were pinging me and\\nasking me if i wear makeup on daily basis or it's only\\nfor vlogs but if you must have noticed it guys i\\nhave stopped wearing makeup like i don't really put concealers and\\nfoundations because i don't want myself to get addicted to\\nit because once looking at yourself in a flawless manner then it becomes very\\ndifficult to you know actually get to the natural\\nside of yours but yes that's the only reason i have\\nstopped wearing makeup and i generally just put on some blush or i\\njust put on lipsticks and that's it that is my go-to\\nmakeup these days and i make sure that my hair is done\\nproperly yes and that is all i do on my face\\nwhile i while i'm going out or while i'm\\nvlogging and obviously when i'm at home i don't really uh do\\nanything to my face and it's just a moisturizer\\nso i hope that answers your question guys so for first now we will have\\nour lunch here and only then proceed with the\\nshopping and in case you are wondering until now why i\\nwhy haven't i had put the mask so that was because we were on the streets and\\nthere are no people around us but now there now that we are into the\\nsmall and we are there are people around us it's\\nour responsibility to put on the mask so here is our meal for today\\nhe started hogging also i'll show you what\\nthis is this is potato hash brown this is turkish bali these are two type\\nof salads it's a cucumber salad and cabbage salad\\nand these are french beans they're boiled this is\\nred cabbage beetroot these are the type of salad\\nand this is pierogi this is the mayo sauce\\nand this is cream and mushroom sauce and mushroom with sour cream\\nokay and this is i think this is salsa sauce and\\nrice of course and this is berries with ice cream\\nso i will this is all for my plate and he's having some chicken fried chicken\\nand other stuff let me just dig in right\\naway okay so now we are done having food and\\nthis is cara for behind me it's quite huge but uh now that we\\nuh live here we live here since uh year and a half now we know what things\\nare placed where so it becomes very easy for us to\\nfind but uh yes initially it was a\\ntask for us to find stuffs because we didn't really know\\nwhich things are placed where and moreover uh\\nnot all brands write the name of the specific stuff inside in english\\nthe name is written in polish language so then you have to convert it and then\\nget to know whether it's what exactly is inside the stuff so we first begin with the frozen stuff\\nyeah so no take this one one or two\\ntake two yes and yes you mostly have a lot of stuff in\\nthis freezer which is ready to eat also you just have to\\nmicrowave it and have it uh not those one\\ntake these two these yes this this okay how much two yes not that one this yes\\nstay tuned and this is the meat section this is\\nbasically the sausages section and that's the ready meat that you get\\nand this side is the bakery section you have all types of\\nbreads here i am not going to take this one you have\\nready pizzas a lot of type or types of breads that\\nyou get here the multigrain one a whole wheat one the vegetable section is on the other\\nside which we will be going in some time uh\\nit seems there is no i think this is a whole wheat bread right no this is not wheat bread i don't know so see now you know what what the\\nproblem is there are so much variety of everything here\\nand not everything is written in english this is\\nthe meat section here that's the that side is the fish section\\nthis is the meat one i'm sorry if you guys\\ndon't like to watch this but uh yes that's the that side is the fresh\\nchicken or i mean the fresh meat that you get there\\nand this is the frozen one we generally take this one\\nwe haven't tried the one from the butchers\\nthe fish section you get marinated fish as well 350 grams 350 grams 350 grams just to make sure we are showing him 350\\ngrams because not everyone you just put 250 grams and\\nwe need 350. so on this side you have all\\nthere are marinated fish here also and there are types of\\nspreads and there are salads as well there are this juices here\\na lot of packed stuff and i generally don't prefer having pack\\nfood so i will buy everything as much as i can\\nget in the fresh section so this is where you weight all\\nthe vegetables okay is oh okay i'm just checking if everything is\\nbuilt properly or not now i need to take butter come take two no we already have one okay\\nso strawberries and different types of berries\\nare very famous in poland so if you are here anytime and if you see berries\\naround do try them they are really very sweet\\nand very tasty and maybe you can just have them with\\nthe whipped cream or vanilla ice cream it tastes really very\\ngood and you behind me you can see it's the\\nfreezer and the hell lot of type of\\nbutter there's cheese there are plenty variety of\\ncheeses here and the egg section is here\\npro egg max egg light egg light egg pro egg mash\\nno it's we're just kidding it's all the same i mean it's not the same\\nbut different brands they're different brands and\\nit now it's time to show people's favorite section in the supermarket this is basically the beer section there\\nare

       " \"hello how are you folks? so we are here on the road for a long long drive to Poland yes we're on a land trip from England to Poland I took this vlog to share to you guys how its like to cross the borders of UK  to Europe via eurotunnel. my child is coughing Eurotunnel is an underwater railway tunnel  that connects Folkestone, England with Pas-de-Calais, France According to information it is the only fixed link between the island of Great Britain  and the European mainland. And now were are here in  Leshuttle terminal. Prior to getting here,  first arrange your relevant travel documents  like passport, visa... whichever is needed.  As for me with a Philippine passport, I have yet to get my visa approved  before booking a ticket here in leshuttle. So this trip has been planned  a few months ago. There are types of tickets (to choose from)  when you book a ticket in their website. There are 3 types. The one we took can be refundable and the date of trip  can be moveable in case we don't make it as planned. But the closest date to your intended travel you book,  the least chance of changing and refunding it in case you don't make it. So upon booking your ticket,  you'll be asked what type of vehicle you are driving  and your passengers' information. Make sure all passengers in your car  have the necessary travel documents. Upon arriving here in the terminal, proceed to check-in. Just like what we do in the airport (prior boarding a plane). Check-in at least 1 hour before your  scheduled departure time.  You'll be given a hanger letter for your boarding. Just follow the led directions  leading to where to go next. Now we passed through the border controls. In the border control,  they checked our passports, how many people are in our vehicle they asked to open the windows even check your baggage if you have. They also did a surface test in the steering wheel. This is a test done whether to.. whether the driver is in use of  some substance  and they asked us to open the trunk. Then after checking,  go on driving to the boarding platform  which is now the train.  And now we are inside the train. There you hear the announcement  about safety precautions etc.  It doesn't feel like its moving though. The trip takes about 35 minutes For 35 minutes, we are in the tunnel. We are now in France!\",\n",

       " \"[Music] we invite you to join our chat and today we talk about a culture sh that I fed in two years in Poland yeah you've been here for a long time actually I visited my culture shock in Poland like first um as I made the video like people don't use the umbrella oh yeah on rainy days like it got kind of viral like so many people actually like saw the video yes so why why don't you use umbrella why don't I use umbrella like I I usually do use umbrella but I only use when it's actually raining because when it's mafka when it's like driz I learn I learn now you know you now you learned new word yes I learn the new word MAA mafka mafka yeah yeah yeah mka mka it's like when it's like drizzling so it's like when the when it's like little rain I think we Polish people we don't actually open The Umbrellas so no umbrella on ma yeah because if you open your umbrella it's you already get wet and then you have to like carry it everywhere like when it's wet I know but I don't want to be wet uh rather than the umbrella is w I think for us it's like it doesn't really matter M I think for us it's better to just like we getting we getting wet than the umbrella because then you have to put your umbrella for example in your I don't know back or something and it's wet and everything is wet ah also I found that like in Japan there is always a umbrella stand whenever we go and in Poland you don't have it yeah so you don't have any place to put your umbrella when you go inside building you know yeah and we prob don't have it so we have to carry the umbrella everywhere why you don't want to carry and you don't use umbrella it's unnecessary to carry like wet [Music] umbrella makes sense okay yeah and also I feel like people do like rainy days yeah I think so I think there's like a Vibe when it's like raining it's nice to like just walk and it's like raining a uh also when it comes to working for me it feels kind of weird When My Friends Ask me to go out for a walk because I've never had this experience in Japan with my Japanese friends really like if we hang out it's always for Cafe for lunch dinner uh for karoke you know so there was no option about walking but here I think walking is like popular I think like we could just like I just like oh do you want to go for a walk and we would just like go for a walk and not actually like go anywhere like in general in Japan it it's not a purpose oh it wouldn't be a purpose of going out I think we just like walking in Poland yeah I see many people along the river when it's like really sad like in summer like you could see so many people like walking by V and just like walking you were going also like you were going for a date they would go for a walk is it like popular in Japan no way a so in Poland I think it's like normal just to go for like when you like before going like like some place coffee shop you could just go for a walk or after I think it's like kind of popular here yeah not in Japan you don't go for walks no we don't go for a walk oh that's only for dogs that's funny like because this is another culture difference yeah here we really like walking and also it's like always funny because when I'm walking with like anyone like not polish they always tell me that I walk too fast yes and I think it's also like a Polish thing like we walking so fast yeah many of my friend polish friends walk so fast I need to hurry up to catch up why do you walk so fast all of my all of my you're in hurry it's like for me it's like I like walking really fast because walking slowly is for me waste of time but you like walking that's why I like walking I like walking you like walking fast but you like walking and you said you are thinking that walking is waste of time I know I it's like just like are you like walking fast it's just like it's a thing yeah but all of my foreign friends they always tell me mother why you walking so fast especially you are very fast yeah maybe you will win in the competition so in Poland people take shoes off inside like someone's Place yeah but thing I don't understand is that when I went to a party some people were in their shoes and some people were not okay I don't understand it either oh you so I was like what should I do and because some people are in their shoes or some are not and I don't want to take them off when someone I always take them off when I'm in someone's house because I I think like if people came to my house and they would like like they were wearing like boots for example and it's like wet or like I don't know dirty I would be mad so I always take off my shoes uhhuh yeah I kept wearing them because I didn't want to take them off when someone's are in shoes ah I don't know I always just take them off so that was confusing but sometimes it's better just keep your shoes at parties sometimes it's better just like keep wearing shoes at parties because it's like always like alcohol somewh that's true that's always a mess part oh when I had a party at my place yeah on Halloween last year oh yeah yeah I let people wear shoes mhm on mhm and it was disaster after I told you it's better just to take them off yeah it was a disaster and I learned from the experience and then on New Year's party I told people to take them take the shoes off yeah that makes sense in Japan some restaurants require you to take the shoes off oh so you should be aware that uh your socks don't have um holes because sometimes I do yeah I think sometimes everyone has yeah so in Poland we don't have we don't have to yeah like we don't have to take off our shs when going to a restaurant yeah I've never seen it never happened to me before that will be something interesting actually to take off your shoes this is Japanese restaurant you should haveand in Poland yes you and I was like what why do Japanese people don't hug I think it's [Music] impossible\",\n",

       " 'The 2nd Polish Emperor, and the first from the Lubomirski dynasty - Władysław VII had three sons and a daughter. His third son, who was born after his death - Kazimierz Postumus had three wives one of which was Matilda Lancaster, from the British royal family. They had a daughter - Katherina who married king of France Louis the XIV and a son named George Lubomirski. Matilda’s brother, Emperor George the First married Władysław’s daughter Anna. They had a daughter Anne, who inherited the British throne when George the First died. Her son Frederick Augustus died at a young age, and when Anne the First also died, the British crown went to her cousin, George the Second Lubomirski. After that, he married Maria Lubomirska, granddaughter of Jan the Second, who was his uncle.  Together they had a son, August who was supposed to inherit both Empires.  George’s sister, Polish Katerina, queen-regent of France disagreed with August’s rights to the British throne  and fought over it against a Frenchman Charles de’Medici, Polish regent and father of Maria Lubomirska, August’s grandfather. Polish side won the War of Regents (1720-1722) and August became double Emperor in 1724. Right after ascending to the throne, he faced British revolt led by Matthew Norfolk, who refused to be ruled from Warsaw. August the First died two years later, leaving his infant son August, and wife, Anna Lubomirska from the Georgian branch of the family on the throne. Anna managed to hold both empires together for 14 years. She suppressed Norfolk’s uprising, then dealed with another one led by Octavius Rooke and completely abolished Slavery in both empires, before her son became fit to rule independently.  August the Second dreamed of creating his own colonial empire and bought rights to colonize cold and inhospitable Greenland, creating a second Polish colony after Senegal, that was taken from France in the War of Regents. After a bloody Three Years war with the HRE and Portugal, Polish vassal state - Rhein Union was created. In yet another war, Polish Commonwealth conquered vast territories of Mali and in 1759, duchy of Normandy, loyal Polish vassal since 1724,  joined it as well, giving Polish emperors a crucial territory to keep control over Britain. August the Second ruled for twenty-six years when he died at a young age of fourty-one. His son, Władysław the Eighth, amongst others, expanded Polish colonies in Africa, got new territories in North America, Carribean and Indonesia  and got Gibraltar ceded to the British crown for 50 years, a deal that was supposed to end in 1829. Amongst other feats, Władysław captured Berlin in three separate wars over four years, subjugated Sweden, resigned from being head of the Anglican church and crushed yet another British independence revolt.  During the rule of his successor, August the Third, British nobles demanded that Polish colonies in North America be annexed into British Seven Colonies August refused that, further expanding the divide between Warsaw and London.',\n",
       " \"Imagine this:\\nYou’re in the heat of one of the bloodiest battles of the biggest war known to the history\\nof mankind; The Battle of Monte Cassino, World War 2. Part of an artillery company, you rain fire\\nonto the enemy positions. There have been 3 other attempts to secure\\nthese positions over the course of the past 5 months, all of which have proven very costly\\nand unsuccessful - you can’t afford to fail for a fourth time. And even though you’re doing your very best,\\nyour allies on the frontline are requesting more and more artillery support in order for\\nthem to make a breakthrough, but there’s only so much you can do - there’s only so\\nmany men than can operate and reload the guns. And in a slight pause from all the chaos that’s\\ngoing on around, you glance into the distance and you can’t believe your eyes;\\nA literal 200 kilogram brown bear carrying an ammunition crate rushing to your aid. Following the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact in the\\nbeginning of The Second World War, the Soviets declared that the Polish state, previously\\ninvaded by Axis forces on 1 September 1939, no longer existed, effectively breaking off\\nany prior relations they had with Poland. Roughly 325,000 Polish citizens were taken\\nas prisoners of war by the Soviet authorities and were deported to work camps throughout\\nthe Soviet Union. 2 years later in 1941 however, due to pressure\\nfrom both the British government and the Polish government in exile, which at the time was\\nbased in London, and given the fact the Axis forces broke the non-aggression pact and invaded\\nthe Soviet Union, the Soviets agreed to set most of the Polish prisoners free and let\\nthem organise a military formation on Soviet soil, which would be later known by the informal\\nname of “Anders’ Army”, named after its commander “Władysław Anders“. The initial idea behind this army was to assist\\nthe Soviet forces fighting against the Germans on the Eastern Front, where the Germans had\\nthe upper hand. But the Soviets soon realised that this war\\nwent downhill for them very fast and they barely had enough food rations to feed their\\nown troops, let alone the Polish forces. So in march of 1942, Joseph Stalin agreed\\nto evacuate the Poles to Iran where they would be put under the operational control of the\\nBritish government. It was here where the Polish troops were stopped\\nat a railway station in Hamadan, Iran while en route to join the British troops where\\nthey encountered a young boy alongside a brown bear cub. Given the unusual sight, some of the soldiers\\ngathered around to see what was going on; They were informed that the bear’s mother\\nhad recently been shot by hunters and that he was now an orphan, being cared for by the\\nboy. The soldiers took pity on the bear cub, because\\nit was very much like them, themselves having been left without a family or a home as well. They decided to bring the animal with them\\nand offered the boy some Persian coins, a chocolate bar, a swiss army knife and a can\\nof beef in exchange for the bear cub and the young boy accepted;\\nUltimately changing the bear’s life forever, sending it into an adventure a bear could\\nonly dream of. For the next three months the troops and the\\nbear were stationed in a refugee camp near Tehran;\\nThey took care of the bear cub and treated it like a baby, feeding it condensed milk\\nfrom an old vodka bottle. A particular group of soldiers from the 22nd\\nArtillery Supply Company grew quite close to the bear and decided to name him “Wojtek”,\\nwhich means “Happy Warrior” and became the mascot of the company. Over the course of the next year, the troops\\nalongside the bear were stationed at multiple allied bases throughout the middle east and\\nsoon enough Wojtek grew up and so did his appetite. He gave up the milk and the soldiers would\\ndonate part of their rations to feed the ever growing animal;\\nHe would eat anything ranging from fruit, marmalade, honey, syrup and even beer, which\\nbecame his favourite drink, when his bottle was empty he would sadly look through the\\nopening to see where the rest of the beer was, waiting for someone to take pity on him\\nand serve him another one. Besides drinking beer, Wojtek copied much\\nof the behaviour from the humans around him; He would drink coffee in the mornings and\\nenjoy the occasional cigarette, only accepting already lit ones and turning down the others,\\nwhere he would take a puff or two and then eat the rest of it. They taught Wojtek to salute and to march\\nin line staying on 2 feet, he would also enjoy wrestling with the soldiers, as he got even\\nbigger and stronger the soldiers would wrestle with him 2 or 3 at a time. The men even taught Wojtek how to pick up\\nnew recruits and hold them upside by the boots to make the rookies think they were getting\\neaten. But of course this was just for giggles, in\\nreality he was very docile and would often sleep cuddled up with the soldiers inside\\nthe tents. Imagine the horror of being picked up by a bear\\nand then having the men around you laughing at you as you think you were gonna be eaten, probably a little bit disconcerting if you ask me. If nowadays, some of the stuff discussed\\nwould be considered animal abuse, just remember that at this time they didn't even know that smoking\\nwas a dangerous activity. Whilst constantly being relocated at various\\ncamps, Wojtek made quite a reputation for himself. When the Poles moved to a large Allied military\\ncamp in Iraq, Wojtek allegedly stole a clothesline of ladies’ underwear belonging to female\\npersonnel stationed in the area. He also learned how to break into the communal\\nshowers and turn on the shower on his own, which proved to be a problem because water\\nwas a scarce resource in the middle eastern heat and it was rationed, which sometimes\\nled to shortages. Eventually the Polish troops arrived in Egypt,\\nwhere they were reassigned to fight alongside the British Eighth Army in the Italian Campaign. The British ships which were to carry the\\nPolish troops had very strict regulations which prohibited mascots and other pet animals\\non board, but for the Poles, leaving Wojtek behind was not an option; To get around this restriction, Wojtek was\\nofficially drafted in the Polish Army and listed as a private of the 22nd Artillery\\nSupply Company, with his very own paybook and serial number and off they sailed for\\nItaly. During the 4th battle of Monte Cassino, Wojtek\\nobserved the soldiers rushing around conveying ammunition and he stepped in to help;\\nWojtek helped his unit by carrying ammunition crates which would normally require 4 men\\nto do so, never dropping a single one of them! For his service in the battle of Monte Cassino,\\nWojtek was promoted to the rank of Corporal and in recognition of his popularity, a depiction\\nof a bear carrying an artillery shell was adopted as the official emblem of the 22nd\\nArtillery Supply Company. With the war slowly coming to an end, the\\nproblem of what was going to happen to Wojtek rose, as the Polish soldiers scattered around\\nthe world, it wasn’t clear where the bear would live however. The Soldiers were afraid that if he were to\\ngo back to Poland, the newly formed Soviet-Controlled government would adopt him as a symbol of\\ncommunism, which didn’t really sit right with an army formed up of former prisoners\\nof the Soviet Union. The best solution they thought of was to send\\nhim to the UK, where he lived the rest of his days in the Edinburgh zoo where he became\\nsomewhat of a local celebrity, often being visited by his old comrades, which, much to\\nthe displeasure of the zookeepers, would often toss Wojtek beer bottles and lit cigarettes\\nand sometimes even jump in his exhibit to wrestle with him, just like in the old days. How all good things in life come to an end\\neventually, Corporal Wojtek passed away in December of 1963, aged 21 in the Edinburgh\\nzoo, leaving behind the story of one of history’s bravest bears. He may never have stepped foot in Poland,\\nbut he was as Polish as a bear could get, his legacy lives on to this day, statues depicting\\nWojtek can be found in both Krakow, Poland as well as in Edinburgh. The Imperial War Museum and the Sikorski Museum\\nin London also have memorials. Thank you for watching this video!

       " \"Hey guys thanks for tuning into Amy's\\nCrypt. I am currently in the cutest little town in Poland known as Łagów, and\\nalthough this place is really beautiful and really peaceful it does have one\\nvery haunted castle. Now this castle has been converted into a hotel, so of course\\nwe're gonna go spend the night there. But, we have opted to spend the night in a\\nvery special room. We will be spending the night in the torture dungeon. Alright\\nguys we are just on our way to the castle now but I just wanted to stop and\\nshow you one of the two lakes here. Which is just behind me. It's just so nice here.\\nIt wasn't easy for us to get here. We had to catch a train, hiked ten kilometers\\nand then unintentionally hitchhiked here. But it was definitely well worth the\\ntravel because it's just beautiful. So you can actually just see the castle\\non the other side of the lake. So it's just over there, we're gonna kind of\\ncut around. We'll cut around and go find it now. Alright guys so we have just made it to\\nthe hotel which is inside Łagów Castle and it looks absolutely amazing. We've\\njust checked in and dropped all our bags off inside our torture room, which is\\nreally, really cool. But we'll talk a little bit more about that later. For now,\\nI want to show you around the castle. I want to do some exploring. This place has\\nsome awesome ghost stories that also extend throughout the town and the\\nnearby lakes. So I'm going to check all that out and I think it's going to be a\\nlot of fun! We're just going to enter inside the castle walls, which look\\nreally awesome. This gate here. So just up here is the main tower, which\\nyou can actually climb up. I don't know how to get up there yet,\\nbut we are definitely gonna head up there soon. And there's some cool gated\\nwindows on this side you can see on the tower as well. There's like a drop down the other side. So we're on one side of the castle and you\\ncan see the beautiful lake behind me. There's also, I mean this wall down here\\nas well, which is the defensive wall around the castle and then on the other\\nside of that it looks like there's another ruin structure. So we might go\\nahead and explore that area too. That might be really cool. So we're about to head\\ninto the castle. Around one side of the castle. It also has a restaurant inside of\\nit and a function space so there's a lot of weddings by the looks of it here. It's\\nreally beautiful and nicely presented inside. So we're just in one of the dining spaces and\\nit's so grand and beautifully decorated in here. It's just so nice, like this light fitting. There is another dining room here that looks a bit more medieval\\nthemed and I prefer it, just looks really, really cool. We're kind of standing right above it now. Just behind me here is the function area for weddings and it's really, really pretty\\nand we'll go explore that in just a minute. So the area I'm in is this kind of long\\ncorridors that wrap around the central courtyard and it's really cool. I'm\\nlooking down into there. It's also where most of the hotel rooms sort of span off from, but not as well us. We are down the stairs because it's a little dungeon. There's some really sick armor and shields\\nup here. That's some really cool decoration. So just behind me is the main dining and\\nkind of function area and it's a really pretty space and it's awesome how\\nthey've got these plants just kind of draped over every single wall. It's\\nreally, really cool. So iI just found something really cool. Hey\\nJarrad. Alright see ya. Get me out. So just made it to the outside of the\\ncastle, we're gonna, we think that this is the way up the tower. Looks like it.\\nLet's go explore. This is a really creepy little room. So these are those barred off windows you\\ncan see from the bottom of the tower. So I just found a really scary-looking\\ntrapdoor. I don't know what it is or where it goes to. That looks really deep. Can you see\\nanything down there? I can't really, I can't see the bottom. That is scary.\\nDon't stand on it. Alright, gonna have to finish walking up the final staircase\\nto the top of the tower. There is another staircase. Imagine this is a dungeon. It's got a nice\\nview for a dungeon. Check this out. You can see the whole Lake. It's bigger\\nthan I thought. You keep telling me it's the last stair case and\\nthen there's more. I don't know. I feel like surely that was the last one. it's not safe to stand on the bit in the middle. It does seem odd, doesn't it? That's the flag pole. So I've made it to the top of the castle\\nand it's really cool. We are literally at the highest point in Łagów. So you\\ncan just see the whole town. It is an amazing view. It's a really cool tower as\\nwell. Alright guys. I found a room in the tower,\\nwhich is nice and quiet and a little bit creepy, so I feel like this is the\\nperfect spot to tell some of Łagów Castle's history and its ghost stories.\\nOkay so obviously we are in Łagów Castle and it is located in the\\nsmall Polish town of Łagów, which is pretty close to the Germany border. The\\ncastle itself is surrounded by two very pretty Lakes and parts of the\\ncastle are very old. The first mention of this place was back in 1299, though parts\\nof the castle have been remodeled and built onto in later centuries. So Łagów Castle has had various owners during its lifetime, it's been besieged\\nand taken over. Parts of it have been destroyed and then rebuilt. So it has a\\nquite an interesting history and it's really not surprising to me that this is\\nlisted as a haunted place. So this leads us into our first ghost story, which is\\none of lost love and is a little bit sad. During the 15th century a Polish Knight\\nactually claimed Łagów Castle for his own. And at first the townspeople really\\nliked him. He seemed like a really good guy, but after his wife died he took a\\nturn for the worse and became bitter. Later on his sister came to\\nlive with him here in the castle. Legend has it that during a battle, this Polish\\nknight took an enemy prince prisoner, and kept him here at Łagów Castle in a\\nvery dark, depressing dungeon. This prince then took to singing to kind\\nof brighten his own mood and just keep himself entertained and sane. Now this\\nprince actually had a really great singing voice and soon the townspeople\\nkind of caught on to this and they would all gather around the castle just\\nto hear him sing. It was almost like a performance for them. Pretty soon the\\nPolish Knight's sister heard this captured Prince's beautiful singing\\nvoice and she felt compelled to bribe the guards at the dungeon just to meet\\nhim. The two really hit it off and pretty soon she was visiting on a regular basis\\nand of course they fell in love. Sadly though, the Polish Knight's sister was\\npromised to another Knight from a neighboring community. And at their\\nwedding day the prince who was held prisoner, was brought up to sing at their\\nwedding. And he was angered by this he refused to sing, which led to his\\nexecution. So the prince was beheaded and his body was thrown into the neighboring\\nlake. This was all witnessed by the sister who loved him so dearly. And\\nlegend has it that she immediately died of a broken heart.\\nEven before her own marriage could be consummated. Since her death, many people here in town have claimed to see her ghost. She is commonly\\nseen wandering at the shores of the lake, where her beloved prince was\\nbeheaded and his body thrown. She's also been seen all around town and\\nparticularly wandering the halls of the castle. The murdered Prince is also said\\nto haunt the area and his voice and singing can supposedly still be heard\\nfrom the dungeon area. And don't forget guys, I'm spending the night in the\\ndungeon or torture room. So if you want to see my paranormal investigation and\\novernight stay there, make sure to hit subscribe. My part 2 video should be out\\nvery soon. So I do have one more ghost story that\\nparticularly centers on the room that we are staying in tonight, which is the\\ntorture dungeon and supposedly the most haunted room in this castle. So this\\nghost is supposed to be of a former owner known as commander Andreas Von\\nSchlieben and he was first spotted in the bedroom in 1820. He supposedly appears to males staying in that bedroom, primarily in the summer and spring months. So I'm\\nreally crossing my fingers and hoping that Jarrad can get a glimpse of him\\ntonight. How do you feel about that Jarrad? What!?! So yeah, that's just a cool little\\nghost story about the room that we're staying in. There's a really cold breeze coming out of here. Wow there really is. I don't remember it\\nbeing this cold on the way up. Do you? Now that is interesting. It is freezing.\\nLet's go walk through it. Oh this staircase is so skinny. Maybe it's just the brick? Yeah, it feels warm in here. Walking right next to the castle, which\\nis this side, then we have a beautiful church on my other side. The lake is\\nbehind me. We're gonna walk down there. That is where the imprisoned prince was\\nbeheaded and where his body was thrown. We're gonna explore that area and\\njust go check it out. So I don't know what's with this rock. It seems like  it's a sculpture. it's like bits of the rock have fallen off and then\\nthey thought Oh we'll just reattach them get some staples and just drill a bit\\nback on. But anyway we are in the lake-front now. The castle is up here behind me and\\nyou can kind of see the fortified wall here, which was a defensive structure. A\\nlittle bit this way is that, it's kind of spooky looking ruin. Not really sure\\nwhat it is or even if it is a ruin, but I think I have a closer look because it\\nkind of looks like it goes under ground. And it's all barred off and its a bit spooky. oh my god it is freezing. Yeah, I can feel that cold draft coming out of there. Is this supposed to swing? Can you climb under? I can't really see anything let me try\\nand get my torch. What's in there? I can't see anything really.\\nIt looks like an empty room full of trash. All right, so we're moving on from the\\ncreepy door because we cannot squeeze in there. Look another window. That\\ncertainly looks spooky. Put my torch on. You can't see anything down there hey.\\nOh that's so creepy. Alright, just keep walking around. It's almost like a stage area as well on\\ntop. Jarrad you can fit in here. I don't think so. Jarrad cam? Jarrad cam my a**. So we're just standing on the edge of\\nthe lake on this little jetty or pier depending on where you're from. And this\\nwas where the prince that was kept prisoner was beheaded and his body was\\ndisposed of. So the ghost of his lover is supposed to be sighted along the banks\\nof the lake up here as well. So I think it's an interesting spot and it seems\\nlovely and nice now, but knowing that story is very interesting and a little\\nheartbreaking even. And the castle is literally just up there where we're\\nspending the night, so we might even come out to explore a bit later in the dark.\\nSo if you want to see that subscribe. Because it's coming in part 2. I really love it here. It's \\nsuper nice and I get a very total Camp Crystal Lake, Friday the 13th vibe\\nhere as well. That's why I love it so much. That is so deep.

       " 'In a major effort to modernize the fleet of tracked combat vehicles Polish Defense Minister Mariusz Błaszczak on March 1 signed a framework agreement for the procurement of about 1,400 Borsuk infantry fighting vehicles Borsuk is an amphibious infantry fighting vehicle produced by Huta Stalowa Wola, a part of PGZ, designed to replace the fleet of obsolete BWP-1 The first deliveries are scheduled between 2024 and 2025 \"The first four examples will be tested by the Polish Armed Forces this year,\" said the Polish Minister Borsuk IFV is a modern tracked vehicle designed for mechanized infantry elements with the expectation of bringing high combat efficiency as well as features superior to the old infantry fighting vehicles It is known that these vehicles were field tested by the Polish army at the Orzysz training ground on November 14, 2022 Development of this vehicle began in 2014 and the first version was unveiled in September 2017 at the Polish Defense Exhibition Borsuk weighs 25 tons, when equipped with additional armor, it can be up to 40 tons The vehicle has a length of 7.5 m, a width of 3.5 m and a height of 2.7 m Borsuk IFV is equipped with basic armor, capable of protecting against shell fragments and mine blasts In addition, Borsuk can also install other armor layers depending on requirements and tasks The layout of the Borsuk is divided into three main sections with the driver\\'s position in the front left a turret mounted in the middle, and the troop compartment at the rear. The vehicle\\'s combat crew has 3 people including: driver, gunner and commander It can also carry up to 8 fully armed soldiers Borsuk is based on a tracked chassis developed and manufactured entirely in Poland The vehicle uses a MTU 8V199 TE20 diesel engine with a capacity of 720 horsepower, allowing it to travel at a speed of 70 km/h, a range of 600 km When overcoming water obstacles, the IFV can develop a speed of up to 8 km/h The Borsuk is fitted with a remotely-controlled turret, which was developed under the ZSSW-30 program It is armed with a 30 mm cannon There is a coaxial 7.62 mm machine gun and two Spike LR anti-tank guided missile launchers The turret has a modern fire control system with a hunter-killer capability The ZSSW-30 turret has been developed as a separate program.  Due to an on-board weapon system, the infantry fighting vehicle has the ability to fight infantry armored vehicles, air targets and other objects in all weather conditions and at any time of the day It is estimated that a single Borsuk IFV could cost around $6.6 million Cost of the Polish remotely-controlled turret would constitute almost 50% of the vehicle value After the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact military bloc Poland has about 1,300 BMP-1 and BWP-1 infantry fighting vehicles designed by the Soviet Union since the 1960s The new Borsuk infantry fighting vehicle procurement package will take the combat power of Polish infantry to a whole new level',\n",

It means you\\'ve defended something during your life.\" These words come from the mouth of Winston Churchill, one of the greatest politicians in the history of the world. Although Churchill himself lived to a ripe old age, dying of a stroke at the age of 90, he knew perfectly well that constantly being in the spotlight was associated with the risk of losing his life. History knows many such cases, and the 20th century - the time of great wars, crises and new political systems - was extremely abundant in this respect. Already in the first years of this turbulent period, one of the most significant murders occurred - the shooting of Austrian Prince Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo in 1914, which marked the beginning of the First World War. The 20th century is also a history of radicals who tried to forcibly eliminate the most significant representatives of the ruling camps. The assassination of President John Kennedy, who died at the hands of an assassin while passing through Dallas in 1963, still captures the imagination of conspiracy theory fans. Like the murder of Italian Prime Minister Aldo Moro, whose body was found in the trunk of an abandoned car in \\'78 . There were also many conflicts and attacks in Poland, which in the 20th century was a real melting pot of views and beliefs. Taking into account the political background at that time, including regaining independence, then World War II, and finally the traumatic period of communism, it can be said that Polish political activists were constantly exposed to danger. December 1922 in Poland was marked by the first presidential elections in history. The head of state was elected by the National Assembly. During four rounds, the leaders of the largest party groups were eliminated one by one. The final, fifth vote included only two candidates: Maurycy Zamoyski, representing the right wing, and Gabriel Narutowicz, former Minister of Foreign Affairs and representative of the left wing PSL \"Wyzwolenie\". After obtaining 56% of the votes thanks to support from the left, center and national minorities, Narutowicz won the elections. Many MPs voted not so much for him as against Zamoyski, who, as one of the largest landowners in the country, could not count on the support of left-wing supporters of agrarian reform. Information about Narutowicz\\'s victory electrified right-wing circles, which, expressing their dissatisfaction, organized demonstrations and marches on the streets of Warsaw. The new president was described as an anti-religious freemason representing the interests of world finance. Despite the clearly felt tension manifested by the specter of civil war, few probably expected that the term of office of Gabriel Narutowicz would also be the shortest presidential term in the history of Poland. Eligiusz Niewiadomski was a trained painter. He graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in St. Petersburg. Privately, he was a staunch supporter of nationalism. In his youth, he became involved with the national-democratic movement, openly supporting Roman Dmowski. In his opinion, the country was heading towards left-wing decay, for which he originally blamed Józef Piłsudski, but when he decided not to run for president, Niewiadomski transferred his antipathy to the newly appointed Narutowicz. Their paths crossed on December 16, 1922, just 5 days after Narutowicz was sworn into his new office. The president was then present at the opening of the exhibition in the Zachęta building in Warsaw. Niewiadomski also appeared there - equipped with a revolver, from which he fired three bullets at Narutowicz. There was panic in the building. A nearby doctor almost immediately diagnosed the death as a result of internal bleeding. Niewiadomski did not run away from the scene and voluntarily handed himself over to the police. He showed a similar attitude during the trial. He did not appeal against the death sentence imposed on him. The sentence was executed by firing squad on January 31, 2023. After the execution, the right-wing press described Niewiadomski as a madman, the only one responsible for the crime. Meanwhile, taking into account the anti-presidential campaign and the atmosphere of hatred fueled by the enemy camp, it is hard not to get the impression that Niewiadomski was not the only person responsible for Narutowicz\\'s death. Hello, this is Warsaw and all Polish Radio stations. This morning at 5:40, German troops crossed the Polish border, violating the non-aggression pact. A number of cities were bombed. You will soon hear a special announcement. During World War II, many representatives of the Polish political elite died at the hands of the enemy. An example is the then president of Warsaw, Stefan Starzyński, who, after the German attack on Poland and despite attempts to convince him to leave the country, remained in the capital, taking an active part in forming the defense of the city . I am starting to create units defending Warsaw. The first unit is to be ready immediately. We must immediately show that Warsaw has its own soldiers, its own Varsovians, who will stand with weapons in their hands, even today, at this moment, even in an hour or two, and will fight for Warsaw and their homeland. From childhood, Starzyński was taught love for his homeland, which he expressed in later years by joining the Polish Legions after the outbreak of World War I, and when, as the president of Warsaw , he kept Poles\\' spirits up with speeches on Polish Radio during the dramatic period of the September campaign. \"I wanted Warsaw to be great. I believed that it would be great. (...) today I see great Warsaw,\" he said, when the capital and its inhabitants were defending themselves against the aggressor. The attack on Poland ruined the development plan for Warsaw, which Starzyński had developed in cooperation with ministers and President Mościcki. The assumptions included not only the further development of communication infrastructure and the construction of new apartments, of which approximately 100,000 were built during Starzyński\\'s term of office , but also the adaptation of the capital to host events such as the Olympic Games or the World Industrial Exhibition. The Germans arrested President Starzyński on 27 October \\'39. A month after the capitulation of Warsaw. He was detained in the city hall and, after interrogations, placed in police custody. Later, he was transported to the Pawiak prison, from which underground activists planned to get him out. Documents and a new hiding place were prepared, but Starzyński knew that his disappearance would end in revenge on innocent Poles. He didn\\'t want to endanger anyone, so he didn\\'t accept help. It is known that he stayed in Pawiak until December \\'39. At the end of that month he disappeared without a trace, and his further fate was shrouded in mystery for a long time. These barbaric methods of beating specifically on churches or national monuments, such as the castle or Belvedere... These barbaric methods that have nothing to do with war, that are not war, that are bandit methods, must arouse anger, severe anger that will avenge these all the wrongs that the people of Warsaw suffer today. There are at least several versions as to when and how Stefan Starzyński died . One of them directs the attention of interested parties to a German labor camp established on the site of a former potassium salt mine. According to this account, the president died in \\'44, tortured by standing in one place with buckets of water hanging on his shoulders. According to another version, he was killed a year earlier in or near the Dachau concentration camp, where Starzyński was supposedly sent for refusing to cooperate with the Germans. Some witnesses claimed that before his death, the president was placed in a special bunker and his own speeches were played non-stop for three days. But both these and many other versions were considered untrue by the Institute of National Remembrance. According to the findings of the Institute of National Remembrance, the whole story ended in \\'39, between December 21 and 23. Based on the testimonies of witnesses, it was assumed that three Gestapo men were behind Starzyński\\'s death and shot him near Warsaw. However, it is not known who issued such an order or where the President was buried. After the end of World War II in 1945, the Republic of Poland and its citizens were still far from freedom. The only thing that changed was the occupier, who did not hesitate to use even the most radical measures to maintain the communist system. For this reason, members of the Polish United Workers\\' Party, the then ruling party, were perceived by many citizens as traitors to the nation. It is therefore not surprising that in the Polish People\\'s Republic there was no shortage of stories in which politics was intertwined with death. Although not all high-level assassinations were motivated solely by ideological reasons. In 1971 , the body of Jan Gerhard, a member of the Sejm on behalf of the Polish United Workers\\' Party, was found in a Warsaw apartment . The secretary of the weekly Forum, of which the 50-year-old was the editor-in-chief, informed the police about his disappearance. The condition of the corpse, or rather the mutilated head, the dagger stuck in the back and the belt tightened around the neck, clearly indicated that the perpetrators had no mercy. Gerhard was a wealthy person, but the robbery motive was contradicted by the 12,000 zlotys that the police found in his jacket pocket. It is true that several valuable items were lost , but due to the social status of the victim and the way in which the apartment was plundered, including documents taken out and scattered around, it was assumed that the motive for the murder was political. Jan Gerhard was not just an MP engaged in journalistic activities. He was also a retired soldier of the Polish People\\'s Army with the rank of colonel. One of the accepted hypotheses assumed that his death could have been revenge for his participation in Operation Vistula, the aim of which was to displace the Ukrainian population from south-eastern Poland and liquidate the units of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army operating there . The press publications about the UPA committed by the deceased were also far from favorable, which led the case even further to the path of possible revenge. Gerhard was also one of the members of the commission established in the early 1970s to investigate the circumstances of the death of General Karol Świerczewski, whose death was used as a pretext for carrying out the above-mentioned \"Wisła\". Świerczewski died in 1947, on his way to a military garrison located in the areas fighting with the UPA. According to the official version, along the way there was a confrontation with Ukrainians, which resulted in Świerczewski\\'s death. General Świerczewski made this decision unexpectedly , at the last moment, deciding to drive into an unguarded area. General Świerczewski responded to our warnings by repeating the order, and you know how it is in the army, an order is an order. Doubts as to the actual course of events were raised by conflicting witness statements regarding the duration of the fight itself and the number of people taking part in it. Moreover, the commission established after the incident indicated that the general died after being hit by two bullets, although the marks on his uniform indicated that he had been shot three times. The accumulated doubts meant that the investigation was resumed at the beginning of the 1970s, and Gerhard was one of the members of the body responsible for preparing a new report. Perhaps the results would have come to light if the document (if it existed at all) had not been stolen from the safe belonging to the chairman of the commission, and its member, Jan Gerhard, had not been murdered in his own apartment. During the investigation, scenarios such as linking Gerhard\\'s death with his alleged intelligence activities were also analyzed. The murdered man\\'s rich love life, which he led with many married women, was also analyzed . But the case was solved thanks to traveler\\'s checks to Bulgaria, which the murdered man purchased before his death and which were included in the list of documents stolen from his apartment. The person who put the checks into circulation testified that he obtained them from Zygmunt Garbacki, the fiancé of Gerhard\\'s daughter. Garbacki, although he came from an intelligentsia family. maintained contacts with the so-called social margin. He exchanged his studies at the Faculty of Architecture for libations and theft. He claimed that he killed him because Gerhard agreed to marry his daughter Małgorzata. The politician actually set some conditions, but they were limited only to completing studies before getting married. For the 27-year-old, however, it was an insurmountable wall because he was expelled from the university due to absenteeism and poor grades. But importantly, Garbacki did not act alone. He was helped in committing the crime by his friend, Marian Wojtasik, who was supposed to receive money for the work he had done. Wojtasik, who has committed attacks including: he pointed out that by murdering the singer Jerzy Połomski, Garbacki intended to make it easier for himself to obtain the fortune of his would-be father-in-law. He had planned to kill him earlier, but a good opportunity came only on August 20, \\'71. To direct investigators towards a political motive, the perpetrators deliberately scattered various documents around the apartment. Interest in the trial of Garbacki and Wojtasik was so great that admission to the trial was possible only after presenting a special ticket. The defendants pleaded guilty to the murder they were accused of, although Garbacki maintained that he did it for his fiancée, who was restrained by her father. However, the court did not find any mitigating circumstances and, finding that the perpetrators acted solely for robbery purposes, sentenced them to death, which, according to press reports, was executed in January \\'73. But Jan Gerhard\\'s death was talked about for a long time. There were many suspicions that the trial was fixed and the robbery motive only served to conceal the political conspiracy. Believe us, we cannot perform a miracle in one year. And if we wanted to perform such miracles, we would move from the category of communists responsible for the country to the category of miracle workers, and miracle workers will not help our country in any way. While the murder of Jan Gerhard is officially considered solved , there are many cases in the pages of Polish history that are still shrouded in mystery. One of them is the crime committed by the Jaroszewicz couple in 1992. Throughout the 1970s, Piotr Jaroszewicz held the office of Prime Minister. It was during his term of office that a wave of strikes took place in Poland in June 1976, caused by drastic increases in food prices. At the beginning of the next decade, the Prime Minister was removed from power and soon after removed from the party. In 1992, Jaroszewicz and his wife Alicja lived in a villa in Anin, Warsaw. On the night of August 31 to September 1, several attackers entered the property. The next hours were marked by the ordeal to which the former prime minister and his wife were subjected. It is known that after breaking into the villa, Jaroszewicz was taken to his office where the 83-year-old retired activist was brutally tortured and strangled. No mercy was shown to his wife either, who was kept in the bathroom all this time and finally shot with a gun belonging to her husband. The bodies of the murdered were found by their son, who came to the house in Anin, concerned about the lack of contact. An investigation was initiated, from the very beginning focused on the robbery motive, even though no valuables were missing from the villa. In addition, the officers who arrived at the scene trampled some of the tracks. The professionalism prevailing at that time is evidenced by the fact that a cigarette butt smoked by one of the investigators was mistakenly included in the evidence . It is therefore not surprising that the way the services acted aroused suspicions as to their actual intentions, thus contributing to the emergence of conspiracy theories. Those who looked for something more than a robbery motive in the Jaroszewiczes\\' death were fueled by the fact that despite the victims\\' restraints, the prime minister\\'s right hand remained untied. As if he was going to sign something before he died. Moreover, despite the obvious injuries, Jaroszewicz\\'s shirt was suspiciously clean. It is not known why the perpetrators would have allowed him to change his clothes before his death. According to popular theories, the death of the Jaroszewicz family was linked to documents that the Prime Minister, while still a soldier, allegedly obtained during World War II. It was about the Nazi archives, which, according to rumors, contained information that discredited the then political leaders of the international arena. According to this theory, together with Jaroszewicz , the Sudetes guide Tadeusz Steć and the general of the Polish People\\'s Army, Jerzy Fonkowicz, were in possession of such documents . What all three of them have in common is that they were all murdered in the 1990s. Stec died half a year after Jaroszewicz. Fonkowicz only five years later, but the torture he was subjected to before his death was similar to that suffered by the former prime minister. Another reason for the murder of the former politician was seen in the so-called matryoshka dolls, i.e. lookalikes of the most important activists of communist Poland, allegedly planted by Moscow . Jaroszewicz allegedly learned from General Świerczewski that Soviet comrades sent their version of Bolesław Bierut to the Vistula . Supporters of this theory do not rule out that not only Jaroszewicz died because of access to this knowledge, but also the previously mentioned Świerczewski, known for his promiscuous language. Yet another theory concerns the books that Jaroszewicz wrote in the 1990s and in which, according to this version, he revealed too many secrets of the then government. The trial regarding the murder of the Jaroszewicz family began in \\'94. Four criminals known to law enforcement agencies sat on the stand. The key evidence in the proceedings was the testimony of the concubine of one of them, who revealed that the men were planning an attack on the former prime minister and his wife. Ultimately, the woman withdrew her words, and the remaining evidence was so weak that even the prosecutor requested the acquittal of the accused. The next chapter of this story opened only in 2005. The investigation was resumed due to technological progress and the development of new systems that could have contributed to the correct identification of fingerprints secured in the Jaroszewicz house. And perhaps it could have been done, if not for the fact that the foil with fingerprints on it was lost. The foil was found only years later, but it did not bring anything new to the case. In 2020, three former members of the so-called karate gang - a criminal group operating in the 1990s. However, this does not mean that the case has been solved. The legal proceedings are ongoing and whether the right people were blamed remains a matter of dispute. - Hello. - Good evening, good evening. - Hello, hello, very nice welcome. - I heard today is our birthday? - Yes, yes, yes. - I would like to express my best wishes: good health, prosperity... - Thank you very much. - That you will always be fit and fit... - Okay... - And that everything will be as good as possible, that everything will go according to your thoughts. - Thank you very much for remembering. I\\'m very glad you called. - If you want it, it will work out, - If you want it, it will work out. That\\'s true. In the 1990s, the world of the political scene and the so-called the underworld intertwined regularly. Politicians who, due to their positions, were able to offer favorable arrangements for property or law often fell victim to extortion or willingly agreed to cooperate in exchange for private benefits. It is true that Jacek Dębski died in 2001, but his activity was largely at the end of the 20th century. The peak of his political career was in 1997, when he became the head of the Office of Physical Culture and Tourism. He was removed from his duties three years later, as a result of an interview he gave to one of the newspapers. He confessed that a high-ranking politician encouraged him to collect materials compromising, among others, Aleksander Kwaśniewski. After this event, Dębski\\'s relations with the criminal world intensified. The former minister borrowed money at high interest and invested in fraudulent interests. One of the people to whom he transferred capital with the intention of multiplying it was Jeremiasz Barański, alias \"Mutton\", one of the fathers of the Polish mafia. Dębski probably died because he demanded the return of the invested funds. His life was ended by paid murderer Tadeusz Maziuk alias. \"Sasza\", who shot the former minister on April 12, 2001, near one of Warsaw\\'s restaurants. But neither Baranina nor Maziuk were sentenced. Their dead bodies were found in their cells before the trial ended. - There was a woman, a very good friend, but without any subtext. - And why did Minister Dębski leave? Perhaps they wanted to talk about something so that the wrong ears wouldn\\'t hear it. A sentence of 8 years\\' imprisonment was imposed on 26-year-old Halina Galińska, alias \"Inka\", who accompanied Dębski on that memorable evening and who, at Baranina\\'s request, led the former politician out of the restaurant, exposing him to the killer\\'s crosshairs. The woman left prison in 2009 and left Poland with her French husband, who was still behind bars. Years after the murder of Jacek Dębski, new theories emerged suggesting that there were two shooters on the night of April 12, 2001, and that the execution itself was related to the former minister\\'s alleged connections with the State Protection Office. People who decide to become politically active must take into account that sooner or later they will make enemies. And it\\'s half the trouble if this hostility ends only in words. It\\'s one thing if emotions take over and invective is replaced by a fired bullet. Analyzing the cases of murders of politicians from the last century, it is impossible to escape the impression that although times are changing, and with them the society and the political and economic situation are changing, the truth remains unchanged that in sports, as well as in politics, it is more difficult to be an athlete than to be an athlete. fan.

       " 'Czy w Polsce da się powiedzieć... nie w Polsce - jak spotykasz tutaj kogoś kto jest z Polski czy da się powiedzieć z którego regionu Polski pochodzą? Tylko po tym jak mówią po Polsku? więc to Właśnie powiedziałeś \"więc\"! Jest... właśnie powiedziałem \"więc\" To jest trochę bardziej skomplikowane. Jeśli chodzi o Polskę. Wyjaśnię dlaczego. Nie zaczynaliśmy nigdy vloga o 9:30 wieczorem ale zaczynamy dzisiaj ponieważ Nie wiem dlaczego nam się to cały czas zdarza... no, cały czas Drugi raz nam się to zdarzyło. Wracaliśmy do domu ze spotkania i biegł sobie pies przez środek ulicy. Jadę bez zapiętego pasa. Nie mówcie nikomu.   Wzięliśmy go ze sobą bo był bardzo przyjazny.   Posłaliśmy ogłoszenie na lokalnej grupie na facebook. Możemy pokazać psa, Blonnie? Sztorm! Chodź tu, Sztorm! O jest, proszę bardzo. Wiemy już, że nazywa się Sztorm bo napisaliśmy na jednej z lokalnych grup na facebooku. Na konkretnej grupie facebookowej dla naszego miasta. ...i już ktoś odpowiedział z imieniem psa. Zgubił się ...oczywiste, że się zgubił. Wcześniej dzisiaj się zgubił i tak się składa, że MY go zobaczyliśmy. Biegł sobie przed naszym samochodem jakby w stronę pobocza i baliśmy się, że ktoś go uderzy więc go zabraliśmy. Oto on. Jest bardzo, bardzo przyjazny jak widzicie. Super przyjazny pies, bardzo fajny. Cześć Sztorm. Ludzie już się tagują na tej grupie. Powiedzieli nam, że pies na imię ma Sztorm. Sztorm jest teraz z nami. Tymczasowo. Jedziemy do centrum miasta. Nie, nie - jedź spowrotem na Hence\\'s (lokalna droga). W nadziei zwrócenia tego psa jego właścicielowi. Zatem przy odrobinie szczęścia zdarzy się to jeszcze dzisiaj. Dodamy uaktualnienie. Jak tam? Twój pies? Chodź tu kolego. Jest świetny. Gdzie on był? Na tej drodze. Tutaj na drodze? Tak. My go szukaliśmy itd. Jechaliśmy do domu i biegł sobie jakby przed naszym samochodem. Mam przyjemność obwieścić, że pies odnalazł swojego właściciela. Ponownie są razem i my się dobrze z tym czujemy. Teraz jest już kolejny dzień i... chciałem powiedzieć coś mądrego, ale tak właściwie to nic nie mam. Chyba po prostu... Jest zimno. To powiedz. Zaczniemy ten odcinek. To jest mądre? Chyba to już milion razy powiedzieliśmy. Oczywiście nie jest zimno po mojej stronie. Jest tylko zimno po Blonnie stronie. Ojej... Tobie też jest zimno. Nie jest mi zimno. Dlatego masz na sobie grubą kurtkę. Tak, ale Tobie jest zimno nawet w kurtce. Tak właściwie to mam dwie kurtki na sobie i wciąż mi zimno. Ja lubię zimę. Zima to moja rzecz. i teraz... jest Justin. Cześć Justin. Cześć, trochę zimno. Jak się masz? Trochę zimno... hahaha Dokładnie. Właśnie o tym mówił. Czy możesz powiedzieć po ludzi akcencie skąd szą... Czy da się powiedzieć po ludzi akcencie skąd pochodzą w USA? Ta... tak. Zdecydowanie? W większości. Tak może w 98% przypadków. Chyba że są z tych środkowo-wschodnich stanów szczerze powiedziawszy. Np. jeśli ktoś jest.. Czyli wtedy możesz powiedzieć, że są z tych stanów środkowo-zachodnich. Tak, ale jest ich bardzo dużo. Znaczy się... czy Twoim zdaniem ludzie w Maryland mają akcent? Ja go nie słyszę. Ja nie myślę, że ludzie w Maryland mają... Wiadomo, że jeśli bym słyszał akcenty lepiej to byłbym lepszy w ich używaniu. Moim zdaniem... myślę, że są bardzo specyficzne rejony USA, w których ludzie mają akcent i jest mniej więcej połowa gdzie wszyscy brzmią tak samo. Wiesz, Boston ma bardzo specyficzny akcent. Ludzie z Nowego Jorku w konkretnych rejonach mają akcent. Południe ma swój wyraźny akcent i reszta niejako... Czekaj i jeszcze Fargo, cała Północna Dakota itd. Oni mają bardzo wyraźny akcent. Wisconsin. Tak. Poza tym większość innych stanów moim zdaniem brzmi bardzo średnio. Są mniejsze regiony, nawet w Maryland jak Dundalk. Słyszałam, że tam mają bardzo konkretny regionalny akcent, ale ogólnie to tak mniej więcej 40 na 60 40% ma bardzo wyraźny akcent z różnych miejsc i 60% to po prostu Angielski. Amerykański Angielski oczywiście. Tak. Bo jest również Brytyjski Angielski i Australijski Angielski i No tak, trzeba to zaznaczyć, Amerykański Angielski. Irlandzki Angielski. Wszystkie te są bardzo odmienne. Te akcenty słyszę. Nie jestem aż tak głuchy na akcenty. Bogdan wrote that the most important thing is to not worry and be yourself. An I... I agree with this completely, Bogdan. One day at the very beginning of time years ago I read, when I was working on my first business here in USA I had huge ambitions back then to be a wedding photographer. I read a book that was named \"The brand called YOU\". Which basically means that you are your brand. You are your brand. In other words Your business, the face of your business and what your company represents is in an essence your own personality. And that\\'s something you should be selling. And this... Dobry dzień na kilka zdjęć. Zgadza się. Aaaaand I agree with this if you are not showing to people this, this... essence of your own personality then it\\'s very difficult, a lot more difficult to sell anything that you want to sell. W Polsce jak mówisz mi o tych lokalnych dialektach jak ja przed chwilą powiedziałam o USA jest mniej więcej podział 40/60 procent. Przy czym te 40% ma bardzo specyficzne akcenty. Powiedziałbyś, że każdy region Polski ma swój dialekt? Czy są tylko konkretne regiony, które mają dialekty? Są specyficzne regiony Polski, które mają bardzo specyficzny akcent jak np. Śląsk. Jak my jedziemy do Warszawy, Poznania, Szczecina Suwałk albo nawet pod granicę wschodnią ludzie mogą i natychmiast usłyszą, że jesteśmy konkretnie ze Śląska. Ludzie spod wchodniej granicy, mieszkający blisko Białorusi, Litwy, Ukrainy również będą mieli specyficzny akcent i swój lokalny dialekt. Bardziej akcent, powiedziałbym niż dialekt. Jest bardzo konkretny i łatwo go rozróżnić. Potem są miejsca jak Kaszuby. To już praktycznie inny język. Jeśli mówią swoim bardzo konkretnym, wiesz... zdecydowanie lokalnym dialektem. Ale... również - i do tego właśnie zmierzałem. Moim zdaniem w całej Polsce są rodziny, albo grupy ludzi - nie wiem jak je usystematyzować, w których kładzie się silny nacisk na mówienie czystym średnim, normalnym Polskim językiem. Dzięki temu słysząc tych ludzi po przyjeździe tutaj nie da się powiedzieć skąd pochodzą z Polski. Bo jeśli mówią czystym Polskim mogą być z dowolnego miejsca w Polsce. Rozumiesz? Czyli jest to niejako trochę bardziej skomplikowana sytuacja niż tutaj ponieważ tutaj jeśli mieszkasz na południu albo mieszkasz w Nowym Jorku albo mieszkasz w New Jersey przez całe życie to będziesz mówić w bardzo konkretny, specyficzny sposób i nie ma od tego. Nie ma od tego wyjątków. Nie da się od tego uciec. Nie ma sytuacji kiedy... wiesz... mieszkasz w Wisconsin ale jakimś cudem przez całe życie mówisz z akcentem południowym. Obydwa są bardzo różne. Do you guys remember how a few episodes ago we recorded a short conversation with a doctor, who is retiring? We took a nice portrait photo of him. He was receiving a very prestigious award in Poland. A prestigious accolade on a behalf of his father. And today the portrait we created for him a few episodes ago we are picking up. It\\'s ready, framed. It\\'s waiting for us. Here, in this store. Cześć, w czym mogę pomóc? Odbieramy zamówienie. Na jakie nazwisko? Brooks. To było coś do oprawy? Tak, do oprawy. Czeka tu od tak dawna, że może już ktoś sprzedał? Nie aż tak długo, tylko od 3go. Tak, sprzedaliśmy już na aukcji! No jest, patrzcie! Pokażesz nam? Tak. Muszę. Żeby się upewnić, że wszystko w porządku i nie ma żadnych problemów. Ja też chcę aparat. Ten wygląda na drogi. Jest niejako drogi. Powiedzmy. Tak wygląda. Będziesz na jego vlogu. To jest Nikon? Panasonic. Ale jest głównie do video. Potrzebuję aparat, który by robił dobre zdjęcia i video. Nie mogę znaleźć właściwego, wiecie? Przyjrzałabym się dobrze Sony. ...i oto jest wielka odsłona. Może zrobimy bębny.... o wow! Patrzcie na to! Wygląda świetnie! To jest... o! On był na vlogu, tak? Wygląda na prawdę dobrze. Co to za vlog? David jest Polakiem więc jest to Polsko-Amerykański vlog. ...i ten gość tak właściwie... Jest na YouTube? Tak, tak. Dlatego się pytam - gdzie go można znaleźć? Nazywa się We Are Going Somewhere. We Are Going Somewhere, tak. Wejdź sobie... Super... sorry, cały czas Ci przerywam! To jest po prostu... my dużo podróżujemy są z tego relacje, a czasem tylko nasze codziennie życie. Jest dużo skrzyżowań między Polską i Ameryką i tak w zasadzie to jest ciekawostka bo ten facet... Wygląda bardzo znajomo. Jest radiologiem w Christiana [szpital]. Też mam kanał na YouTube ale dopiero go zaczęłam. Masz kanał na YouTube? Dopiero zaczęłam. Musisz nam powiedzieć. Jak się nazywa? Nazywa się... chyba się nazywa \"Georgia Peach\". Być może \"The Georgia Peach\". Pochodzisz z Georgii? Nie, stąd. Na imię mam Georgina. Rozpoczęłam firmę, która zajmuje się robieniem kolorowego szlamu - bo jest teraz bardzo popularny. Moja córka też... Poważnie? Ty też się szlamem zajmujesz? Pokażę wam, jeśli nie macie nic przeciwko. Jak tylko ten obraz dla was zawinę. Znasz etsy? Wiesz co to jest etsy? Tak, mam własny sklep na etsy. To jest mój. Przeskroluj sobie, to moje szlamy. Wszystkie są z zapachami i są w różnej wielkości pojemnikach i ten nawet w wyciskarce. Wyślemy Ci kilka osób. Dzięki! Muszę to pokazać Sheridon. Będzie jej się... Dopiero zaczęłam. Zrobię sobie tego zdjęcie. Każdy od czegoś zaczyna. Życzę Wam wspaniałych Świąt! Tobie też! Do widzenia! Wydruk odebrany. Wygląda świetnie. Myślę, że ostateczny odbiorca, klient będzie zadowolony. Dostarczamy go w tej chwili, a potem co robimy? Musimy na coś popatrzeć. Coś musimy zobaczyć. Może o tym zavlogujemy, a może nie. Znaczy się jest trochę wyżej, ale... teraz jesteśmy obydwoje w kadrze. Po co to robimy? No dobra, słońce. Bo jest dziwnie w zimie. Próbuję nagrać coś bardzo prostego od trzech dni. Nie da się tego zrobić w studiu bo jest tam super zimno. Nie chcę tego nagrywać na kanapie w domu bo jest to zbyt... ...prywatne środowisko jak dla mnie. Dziwnie się czuję jak vlogujemy z kanapy. To nie jest łatwe w zimie. Chyba potrzebujemy Mam wrażenie, że potrzebujemy konkretnego miejsca gdzie moglibyśmy usiąść jak mamy coś do powiedzenia i coś sobie ponagrywać więc teraz będzie się to odbywało w samochodzie. Podczas jazdy. Są ludzie w Polsce, którzy mówią swoim regionalnym dialektem i nie znają innej formy Polskiego? Zdecydowanie. Poważnie? Oczywiście, że tak. Jest dużo takich miejsc i dużo ludzi, którzy mówią tylko swoim lokalnym dialektem i nie potrafią mówić inaczej. Jak to się dzieje? W szkole nie uczą? Jak to jest, że cały czas mówią lokalnym dialektem? Czy możliwe, że w szkołach uczą w lokalnych dialektach? Moim zdaniem to pochodzi z wiesz... środowiska, w jakim się dorasta. Z domu rodzinnego. Od przyjaciół i najbliższych osób. Myślę, że w szkołach kładzie się większy nacisk na mówienie czystym poprawnym Polskim, ale nie jestem do końca pewien jak to wygląda w każdym najmniejszym miejscu w Polsce. Myślę, że to się wykształca w domu rodzinnym, w rodzinie. Dzięki za uwagę. Przepraszamy, że znowu była długa przerwa, ale chyba czas przyznać że robimy co się da. Sytuacja jest nadal taka sama. Po prostu musimy się skupić na zarabianiu dostatecznej ilości pieniędzy na życie. W chwili obecnej. Dlatego vogowanie jest niejako mniej częste niż było. W obecnej chwili nie jesteśmy chyba w stanie, to znaczy się... jestem gotów przyznać. Muszę to w tym momencie przyznać Nie jestem chyba w stanie wrócić do cotrzydniowego rozkładu w tej chwili, ale się nie poddaję. Wiesz, w przyszłości może nadejdzie znowu czas kiedy powrócimy do szybszego tempa. Mam nadzieję, że w pewnej chwili się tak stanie i również następny odcinek na tym kanale będzie na prawdę fajnisty. Zostańcie zatem z nami ponieważ w niedzielę Dzisiaj jest co? Środa? Dzisiaj jest środa. W tą niedzielę nagrywamy coś na prawdę fajnego. Nie chcę tego jeszcze zbyt ostro promować bo nic nie zostało jeszcze nagrane. Nie wiemy tak właściwie i nie wiemy jak to wyjdzie, ale bazując na ustaleniach, które zostały poczynione i na osobie, która będzie z nami na kanale jestem bardzo podkręcony. Myślę, że będzie bardzo dobrze. Chcesz coś dodać? Dzięki wielkie, że nadal jesteście z nami! Mamy nadzieje, że jest wam bardzo dobrze gdziekolwiek się znajdujecie. Do zobaczenia za kilka dni! 54 mile się przeprowadziłam jako dziecko. Z Natchitoches Louisiana do Hemphill w Teksasie. W Natchitoches dorastałam wymawiając słowo EGEJN. Wiesz, słowo A-G-A-I-N. I jak się przeprowadziłam do Teksasu, tylko o 54 mile dzieciaki w szkole się ze mnie śmiały za wymowę EGEJN. Mówiły mi: to się mówi EGEN, nie EGEJN.',\n",

       " \"Stop killing us! \\nStop killing us!  There is no doubt that what Pro–the right to live foundation \\nis doing with their vans is pure hate speech. He took part in the rally, seeing  that its participants jointly committed\\na violent attack on property which was a Renault Master car. He did this for an obvious reason. I believe that the restriction of liberty will do its job on this occasion. Brutally stopping the car, snatching the driver from the car with the use of violence and force and then beating and assaulting \\na man by a group of people. One of the perpetrators, \\nthat we know of, used a knife to destroy the car, cutting car parts, \\nand damaging tires. This is not some South American slum. This is the heart of Europe. This is the capital city of Poland. It's not the same knife I used to cut \\nthose tarpaulins, but it's the first knife that I grabbed from the kitchen today, just like the first knife I grabbed \\nfrom the kitchen then. The whole thing was very much  about what an acceptable protest aesthetic is. Can a man have a knife at a protest, or can he have a masked face at a protest. I cut these tarpaulins with a knife like this and I consider it a good thing, because these\\ntarpaulins sowed hatred and were deceitful. And of course I can't tear them with my fingers, I don't have sharp enough nails and strong enough fingers. Sometimes it's okay to have a knife in your hand when you're facing violence  that wants to stab you in the back. The mere fact that violence is used as part of a protest does not deprive it of its nature as a protest. It just makes it a non-peaceful protest. It may not be protected under the Convention or the Constitution, but it's still a protest per se. The campaign informs about what \\nhas been happening in the West for years. Children are taught how to masturbate themselves and others, they learn about risky sexual behavior,\\nthey are encouraged to take  these behaviours to their friends, \\nbut also to older people. Parading in public spaces with these hateful slogans, crossed out rainbows,  suggesting connections between homosexuality and pedophilia,\\nis a textbook example of hate speech that violates the dignity of social groups. These types of narrative,  apart from not being based on \\nany reliable scientific sources, are an example of inciting violence, \\nantagonizing social relations, stigmatizing individual social groups, and in fact it boils down to looking for an enemy. These words, this hate campaign  conducted by the Pro Foundation,\\namong others, its radical wing was led, at that time, \\nby the government, by the ruling party and by the president, \\nand simply by the state apparatus. This hate campaign resulted \\nin real homophobic violence. It resulted, for example, in attacks on Pride Parades. Freedom of speech has very blurry boundaries. It's taken to extremes and becomes hate speech,  i.e. statements that in some way \\nincite hatred or encourage hatred. Sure, we can talk about that, there \\nshould be freedom of speech like it is in the US, where you \\ncan say absolutely anything  and you should use different \\nstrategies, different tactics to confront it. However, there are just as many arguments which say that the other strategies and tactics may not work. On the other hand, allowing such claims  to be made in public spaces\\ncan have measurable effects. History has already taught us that.  Of course, people may disagree with us. People with left-wing views \\nbelieve that each one of us  can say that up until now, \\nwhat time is it,  it's about half past six at the moment... \\nuntil now I was a man, but now I'm a woman. (laughter, applause) Because the left thinks it should be like that. You think we'll be afraid of you? We won't be. Even if we are afraid, we will fight for our lives. Because this is the superior value, \\nbecause human life is important, and it's important that this life is worth something. Our dignity is not an idea, as the judge said. Our dignity is our right. Unalienable! (applause) Foundation Pro Agitator: In this detachment \\nfrom reality, the only hope is prayer. Allies of the convicts: What you are saying \\nis such nonsense that only this judge has said more rubbish. Agitator: That's why we're going to say the rosary prayer now. Agitator: (recites the Our Father prayer)\\nAllies: LGBT right to life, fuck the van!\",\n",

       " \"- Darz Bór and welcome to another video, straight from the Bystrzyckie mountains - Are we in night mode or.. - Yes, it's a bit dark. - It'll be brighter by the second  - This isn't our first snow of the year. Congrats to our friend Zbyszek for the doe dublet he did a week ago  - Our chief gently reminded me that stag hunting is nice but we need to fill the doe plan. That's our goal for today  - I do have 2 more stags to get. Besides that the wild boars and predators. The aura is amazing, perfect blanket of snow over the hill  - We'll take a stroll thru a this huge chunk of forest to try our luck - Later on we'll bring back the doe hunting topic as well. For our rifle we have my 9  - I'm liking it even more recently. Here in the mountains the animal can't run off after the standard shot  - You need to keep it in place, often there's no roads. A bad shot won't do it even with a 9 - Compared to a 308, the 9 does keep the deer in place. Let's start our walk, we'll fly out the drone on our way  - The aura is just beautiful with a slight northern wind  - I'm expecting more game coming from the left side, returning to the forest - We're walking really slowly because it just stopped snowing  - I like to check the exact weather conditions on the Meteo.pl site. It's very precise - That's why I know to look under my feet as well to find a very fresh track like this. We may meet them  - You have to read the forest, look on the ground. This is an obvious signs of doe and a fawn track  - Now we'll go even lower, constantly looking side to side  - A pack of boars walked thru here, it snowed over it so it's not as fresh. Surely from this morning, walking from the left - The game movement is still pretty low  - They ran off. Must have stayed to the left, I've heard a branch crack  - A female with a kid walked 150 m away to the right. At least we've seen one  - That's how a fresh track looks like. We'll move 200-300 m further and come back the same way - I had other plans but the movement is so low. This isn't the first snow when the game becomes stagnant  - They have to adjust first, especially deer. It's weird that I don't see many deer signs now  -  We saw one fresh track of a couple deer and a 1 hour old line. Now we caught that doe - We managed to record them. There's no movement here, there may be some later because it takes them some time to hike up  - I think that the boars already walked thru, I don't know exactly. The deer may still come so I'll move a bit further - I've decided to follow our line back and see if anything crossed it after an 1,5 hours. This is their window of walking - If the lines appear we'll come back. I'll visit this place either way because I know my district and the game behavior  - They just have to adjust to the ''first'' snow. Let's move - We're late yet again. Two boars around 50 kg walked from the left and crossed thru here. It's fresh  - Going against the ''empty feeder'' comments..As you can see they're huge  - A whole wagon of hay fits in. In the last 6-7 years we did feed the wild game but only when they need it  - Not with this little snow and small frost. Instead we have around 30 hectares of fields that we manage and use for this puprose - Mostly clover fields that we turn into haylage bales. I would say around 150 bales weighting 500-600 kg  - The feeders you see right here are common. Every single one has it's manager who comes and add the bale if needed  - We also add the salt blocks. The salt is out all year long, very well seasoned hunting grounds  - We do not hunt near feeders so even if we saw something, we can't shoot. Only foxes - Now let's go and check if something went over our steps  - We looked over a big chunk of land and nothing. Some other signs but absolutely non where we went  - This means that the game is a bit unsure of the snow and doesn't move around. They need 2 days more  - We'll be back. We have a bit of walking to our car so still a chance  - And the hunt is over. I don't want to go back yet with this amazing snowy aura  - With no game movement it's pointless. Some single lines in the busiest areas. I think they just can't get used to the snow, hiding away  - We did see that doe so the hunt was a success. The lines we saw thru the forest are a good indicator that we chose a good spot - We'll be back in one day, it's supposed to snow even harder. Going back we'll check one more place to see if they stayed there  - Now there'll be a interview portion of the video about the future of the Polish Hunting Association  - We were supposed to hunt together with Marcin but the timing wasn't right. The 600 km distance prevent us from doing so  - I'm sure you know who I'm talking about, Marcin Możdżonek. A great sportsman and hunter  - He's a new candidate for the PHA board so we'll ask him a couple of questions over Zoom. So see you next time and Darz Bór - One more thing.

       " 'Just 3 months after signing the contract, South Korea handed over to Poland the first 10 K2 Black Panther main battle tanks Based on the first execution agreement signed in August, Poland is to receive 180 K2 main battle tanks by the year 2025 while another 820 will be produced domestically by Poland South Korea and Poland in August 2022 signed a huge defense agreement worth 14.5 billion USD In addition to the FA-50 fighter or the K9 self-propelled howitzer, the most notable are 1,000 K2 Black Panther tanks According to information published on November 6, 2022 the Korean manufacturer has delivered the first batch of 24 K9PL self-propelled guns nicknamed \"Thunder\"  and 10 K2 Black Panther tanks to the Polish armed forces The handover of a significant number of tanks and self-propelled guns to partners after only 3 months of signing shows that the potential of the Korean defense technology industry is very respectable. It is known that the Korean-made K2 Black Panther tank is being evaluated as the \"king of tanks\" in Asia, considering all the criteria overall In 1995, the Korea Defense Development Agency was tasked with developing a modern armored fighting vehicle using advanced domestic technologies, bearing the designation K2 Black Panther using advanced domestic technologies, bearing the designation K2 Black Panther The K2 uses both modular composite armor of undisclosed type and Explosive Reactive Armor blocks It is claimed that front armor withstands direct hits from 120 mm tank rounds, fired from L55 guns The Black Panther tank is also completed with an active protection system and countermeasures system The tank is also completed with an NBC protection system The main weapon of the K2 is a Rheinmetall 120 mm/L55 smoothbore gun, which is license-produced in South Korea The K2 is completed with an automatic loader This MBT has a maximum rate of fire in 15 rounds per minute It is worth mentioning that autoloader\\'s is similar to that, used on the French Leclerc main battle tank A total of 16 rounds are stored in the autoloader. Remaining 24 rounds are stored inside the hull It also has a very advanced fire control system, allowing to track and engage not only the main battle tanks, but low-flying helicopters as well Maximum effective range of fire is up to 10 kilometers Furthermore its fire control system can spot, track and fire automatically at visible vehicle-size targets  without needing any input from a human operator Mass production began in 2013 and the first K2s were deployed in June 2014 K2 tank is equipped with a MTU MT-883 Ka-501 diesel engine, 12 cylinders, water-cooled with a capacity of 1,500 horsepower and automatic transmission Thanks to this engine, the vehicle can reach a maximum road speed of 75 km/h and 50 km/h when off road, with a range of about 400 km Other features of the K2 tank include digital battlefield management system and navigation system for rapid coordination The K2 can rapidly report combat situation, thus increasing situational awareness of friendly forces The K2 Black Panther has a state-of-the-art semi-active hydropneumatic suspension Every boogie wheel can be individually controlled, allowing this MBT to \"sit\", \"stand\", \"kneel\" or to \"lean\" in any direction K2 combines many advantages of both Russian and American tanks It has advanced combat management system, automatic loader, active self-defense system navigation system, semi-active suspension, NBC protection system and so on With its extremely advanced features, it is easy to understand why Korea\\'s K2 Black Panther main battle tank has a unit price of up to $ 8.5 million / unit  even after entering mass production In addition to South Korea and Poland, Egypt and Norway are also planning to order this tank',\n",

       " 'Alright so, today we\\'re out here in Warsaw, Poland. [Music] It is a beautiful country, but it\\'s pretty\\ncold out today so, I\\'ll tell you guys a little bit about Warsaw. Warsaw is the sixth largest city in the European Union at about a little... under 2 million people 3.1 million in the whole metropolitan area. \\nAlright it was founded... in the 13th century, so you can see a lot of old school Eastern European Vibes here. So let\\'s take a walk around, I will say that the architecture is very, very unique here, right. So let\\'s like, let\\'s take a look. I\\'m actually staying at the Radisson collection Hotel first... time I stayed in one of those. It\\'s really, really nice. We\\'re gonna find some food this morning, we do have a train for a train to catch it about 2:30 to uh Ukraine, yeah... that guy\\'s out there cleaning look at that.\\nWe only have a couple hours, we\\'re just gonna do a... quick little video here, we\\'re gonna come back next summer though, we definitely need to come... back next summer um. I\\'m gonna come back and do Eastern Europe and just kind of backpack... around for a while, which way should we go, we\\'ll go that way. Actually let\\'s go towards... the historical building.\\nThere was a building that was a gift from Russia long, long time ago. Dang! It\\'s cold I was complaining about Bogota, yeah, we\\'re out here figured; Why not... explore a little bit. I could either stay in bed and stay warm or walk around and see what... we have. I know, I\\'m hungry. We need to get some traditional Polish food.  Let\\'s see if we can catch this green light, make it across, oh that\\'s\\ncool! Got the tram, I know those are shut down in ...\\nin Ukraine right now to save power. Maybe check out some nice coffee, local coffee. There\\'s a coffee house. Yeah! This is definitely unique, you can tell the whole that it\\'s very...  European, but at the same time it\\'s definitely got that different Flair of Eastern Europe. Got JP Morgan here. They have a restaurant over here called \"Mamacita\", that\\'s kind of funny. Got Mamacita. It\\'s a coffee house, that\\'s cool. Definitely should have broke out the gloves. We\\'ve got Brooklyn, I\\'m guessing that\\'s a bar. What\\'s really cool about this place is how you\\'ve got extremely, high-tech, new buildings... with uh random old buildings thrown in then middle. Oh that\\'s cool!\\n\"Bank of Santander\" that\\'s... actually, I think it\\'s out of Colombia. It\\'s where my ex-girlfriend\\'s from, we know how that rolls. \"Bucaramanga\". See you\\'ve got brand new high-tech and then old school European... mixed together. Uh, we\\'ve got some graffiti going on. So I\\'m guessing that\\'s down to the... subway. I got a vape shop. Pizza house. So I mean like old school mixed-in with brand new... cafe, let\\'s get a coffee. Body world\\'s vital.\\nI know bodybuilding\\'s huge. Oh there\\'s the Clock Tower. Let\\'s go check... out the clock tower first and then we\\'ll come back for a coffee. Yeah, that is one of the most beautiful clock towers I\\'ve seen. I think that\\'s the one that has the observation deck on the 34th floor.  That\\'s the funniest thing about traveling, because everyone\\'s got\\ntheir own way of dressing in each country. I always dressed the way I want, never really change it. Oh \"Pad thai\", okay.  So, this must be the, the Asian Middle Eastern Area here, because\\nwe\\'ve got: Thai food, Chinese food... um Middle Eastern food. This is crazy. We\\'ve got food from... Heck yeah, let\\'s go check that building out.\\n\"Alcohole\". So, what happens when you drink, sometimes you fall in that hole. Wow, that guy\\'s got my old car! That\\'s neat. Yeah, that\\'s the building we\\'re\\ngonna go check out right now. Alright let\\'s... walk over there.\\nSo we\\'re over here, we\\'re almost\\nat the building I was looking for and I found... this cool little bar: \"Pijama Wisnia\". So, this looks neat I like how they put the bottles... up and put a little light around it. So, it kind of shines through people like the smoke out here I\\'ve already noticed that a lot.  People love the smoke, but yeah. So, let\\'s check this out guys, this is like a little... dog park, out in front of this amazing building.\\nThis is beautiful, look at this. Like I said... you\\'ve got old school buildings mixed in with brand new modern buildings. So this is pretty... neat, this is one of the things that I was\\nreally excited about coming to Eastern Europe... and I\\'m excited, definitely about next year\\nbecause this I mean this is only a couple... hours for us to go check out of the hotel. Beyond that we are going to uh, come back next... summer explore: Moldova, Polonia... Albania, Georgia, a bunch of the former Eastern European countries, just uh, give it the time. and exploration it is definitely do. This is a beautiful part of the world. We\\'re here near, where they do all this construction. They\\'ve got basically, uh posters up everywhere. Got Sam Smith... Ellie Goulding, the kid Leroy for the orange Warsaw Festival... The 1975, Emily Ratajkowski. I think she\\'s from here isn\\'t she?\\n[Music] [Music] [Music] Let\\'s go buy our tickets to go look at the viewing deck here in Warsaw. Alright, so we came out here. We are at the 30th floor of the Terrace so, this building... is the building of culture basically and you can pay 25 zloty... which is 5.80 U.S, 5.80 U.S with the current exchange rate today and then you can go...  all the way up to the top and these are some of the views that you get. So you, they have these... on. I love how they do this where people put their love and stuff together. There\\'s the river, I don\\'t like how they have this but I understand why, safety. I guess in Colombia... I\\'m used to not having it. You just expected not to fall. Oh, my hotel\\'s right over here. I\\'m staying at the Radisson... collection hotel. By the way guys, the Radisson collection hotel is really nice. Normally I... do hostels but, after a long plane flight, I wanted to enjoy myself and have a comfy sleep... so. Oh there\\'s a football stadium by the way... for the Polish team, McDonald\\'s but yeah, this is cool. So this is a and you can walk.  It\\'s kind of like a Skyline View and you can walk all the way around. People have signed it... put their phone numbers. Got Birds up here. \"Warszawa History\". But this is kind of cool, you know I saw this on another video and it\\'s just kind of nice. Ohh I need to go check this out, the famous statue... \"Mermaid\" used to, um, it\\'s basically a famous mermaid statue. This is just like going to a baseball game, where you\\'ve got the the Nets. About three million people in the metro area. About 2 million... for the whole, for the actual city, city. \\nSixth largest city in the EU. I don\\'t like this coverage, I understand why they do it but... that\\'s the one thing I\\'ve noticed guys, it\\'s always because of dumb people that they have... to make stuff like this. Any rules has been created, has been created because someone screwed up. It\\'s usually the case. Oh there\\'s always that one person dude. Always that one person, \"Pat here for good luck\". Always like good luck. I\\'m guessing that\\'s the palace maybe, that\\'s the presidential Palace... right here, I\\'m not sure, I need to do some more research. Everyone puts their IG\\'s up here, anything to get views. Make sure you guys follow my... IG: @armyguytravels, we\\'ll just do it that\\nway. I\\'m not gonna, I\\'m not writing up here... but yeah, so you you show up to the back side over near theater six um, there\\'s actually... a bunch of different exit or entrances to\\nthis complex so, there it\\'s huge, so you have... to enter on the um the \"Pałac Kultury i Nauki\" that area, that\\'s the one you enter there should... be two coffee houses right when you enter the front door, you walk in and there\\'s a coffee... house on the right and left, that\\'s how you know that, that\\'s the one you enter to buy... your tickets, otherwise you can\\'t get in on the other side.  Oh it\\'s cold! See look just look how different, this is definitely Eastern Europe guys, look at that. Actually... this is pretty cool. I think I\\'ll do that for each side so you\\nguys get a view, just come up to the, the windows and... Alright, so we just made it down from\\nthe 30th floor, that was fun, the views were... phenomenal. I definitely need to come back and check this place out I mean but.  So, we were all the way up there. It\\'s a shame we have to go back and check out in an hour. From the hotel and then, I\\'m only gonna have another two hours left after that.  So that kind of sucks. But definitely more of a reason to come back. Alright, so this is cool guys. So this is\\nTim Etchell\\'s: All the things (2020), so it says... All the things, you guys can barely see because it\\'s not lit up. All the things that... could happen next. That\\'s the thing you guys have to understand, you have to do things for the great things... to occur. So this is kind of cool. Polish is so confusing, by the way. I think it\\'s neat, but I don\\'t understand it. Uh, why did I come to this side? This is bad, oh, that\\'s cool.\\nIt\\'s like rubber tiling. I played tennis on... this in high school, down in Green Township, Ohio. They have a court and we had to go play... our high school match there and it was on this rubbery crap. It\\'s really difficult to... play on but, it\\'s good for maintenance see. The ball bounces and skips really bad. Everyone\\'s walking from their \"airbnbs\"... to uh, the train station which is behind us. Wow, that church is cool. Alright, let\\'s cross over. Alright, Little Hooker, Hooker advertisement. That\\'s funny, right in front of the church... that\\'s messed up. Give that to a friend as a gift. \"Figura Chrystusa\", oh it\\'s Jesus, yeah I love churches.  Churches are some of the coolest architecture because the Catholic Church used to spend a lot of... money, a lot, a lot of money. That\\'s cool. I love this. Old, it\\'s like old school mixed\\nwith new school, you can see how warm the buildings... are there but then brand new. This is neat. It just had a weed vending machine, that\\'s wild.\\n[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] We\\'re here in the old town, getting ready. Yeah I picked up a, a Ukraine hoodie.  My head gets cold here anyway so. But yeah this is the old town. We\\'re gonna walk for about five or ten minutes... and then I\\'ve got to go pick up my\\nbags and head to the train station, but yeah. Check out this architecture, this is the old town, it\\'s really, really pretty. Uh, how you doin\\'? It\\'s another lovely place. Oh, okay. So, these were the ones that the lady at the hotel told me about. We just ate at this one... and that is the other one. When I come back in two weeks, I\\'m definitely gonna have to come check this place out.  Yeah, it\\'s got a different vibe here in the old town. Definitely a different vibe. So the one thing you\\'re gonna notice here, they have terrace or terraces everywhere, so... all the buildings, they\\'ll charge you a little bit of money, not much usually and you can.. go up top, so if you look up there there\\'s\\na terrace. If you see t-a-r-e-s, you\\'ll see... them everywhere here, so they\\'re monetizing it which is really smart actually.  Um, you can go up top and uh, check out the views from wherever you are. Oh yes, I need to get one of these when I come back. It\\'s like their Pizza, like polish Pizza. Got garlic sauce, mushrooms, I\\'m gonna get it without the mushrooms obviously but... I will say the one thing that I... I think is kind of cool, is how much the Polish people support the people of Ukraine, their neighbors... and you\\'re out here at the old town, look at this guy. Well, I\\'m assuming it is. Look.\\n[Music] [Music] There\\'s the football stadium, but yeah that\\'s the old town, here. All this is considered the old town. But we\\'re gonna walk back up, catch an Uber and we are on our way to Ukraine.\\n[Music] [Music] Alright guys. Signing off from\\nPoland and about to head to Ukraine.\\n[Music] [Music]',\n",

the back\\xa0\\nroads here wow this reminds me so much\\xa0\\xa0 of northeast Kazakhstan and Russia love\\xa0\\nto go back right about now we're about\\xa0\\xa0 two and a half kilometers from the Belarusian\\xa0\\nborder very muddy from the day's rain with rock\\xa0\\xa0 hard tires ah remember the dirt folks faint\\xa0\\nmemories so here this is the edge of Europe\\xa0\\xa0 of eastern Europe and to go keep going through\\xa0\\nhere you would need sort of visa with Belarus\\xa0\\xa0 you can't do any uh any visa\\xa0\\nlet's travel anymore from here\\xa0\\xa0 because this is uh where uh Schengen\\xa0\\nends the internal borders of Europe they say the two military people standing there\\xa0\\xa0 i miss going to the other side\\xa0\\nno visa on arrival in Belarus i wonder if you actually can't cross the border\\xa0\\nhere before i understand Belarus has strict uh\\xa0\\xa0 border crossing locations so you can only cross\\xa0\\nthe border at certain locations so apparently\\xa0\\xa0 this national park used to be a tsarist hunting\\xa0\\nretreat palace burned down or was destroyed seems to be a lot of military\\xa0\\nactivity going on convoys and whatnot going in and out looks like even an operations unit and again we are close to the Belarusian border\\xa0\\nhere so i think this is the old old sar entry a palace entry you can see\\xa0\\nthe makeshift tents inside that's all the military vans here what do you reckon this is Anastasia's playroom\\xa0\\ni find it interesting to come across this place\\xa0\\xa0 because of course you see tsar you think wait\\xa0\\na sec what does that have to do with Poland\\xa0\\xa0 but it mostly has to do with Russia and more\\xa0\\nspecifically the old Russian empire the one\\xa0\\xa0 that lasted until uh early 20th century it\\xa0\\nwas massive reached all the way to Alaska\\xa0\\xa0 where Europe went colonizing all of Africa all\\xa0\\nof Asia all of south America and north America\\xa0\\xa0 away from their territories Russia when\\xa0\\ncolonizing east all these territories\\xa0\\xa0 in the past that used to belong to khanates you\\xa0\\nknow Genghis Khan even parts of China for a while\\xa0\\xa0 all the way into north America unbelievable\\xa0\\nthey had the ease to colonize eastward but\\xa0\\xa0 westward they increasingly bordered Europe and\\xa0\\nthen all the way into this region here in Poland\\xa0\\xa0 all Belarus all of the Baltics even\\xa0\\nFinland but it was massive only surpassed\\xa0\\xa0 by the British empire i'm not sure maybe the\\xa0\\nMongol was bigger in the end different kind of\\xa0\\xa0 empire but those were the only two bigger empires\\xa0\\nand the British of course also had a very very\\xa0\\xa0 very big hand in world affairs you know let's say\\xa0\\nhow people react to the United States nowadays\\xa0\\xa0 they would react to the United Kingdom but it's\\xa0\\na fascinating thing to consider all these old\\xa0\\xa0 land borders and i say old relatively not even\\xa0\\nuntil that long ago give it 100 years 150 years\\xa0\\xa0 and of course as i mentioned before this was\\xa0\\nduring a time when Poland didn't exist anymore\\xa0\\xa0 because it had been partitioned up to three times\\xa0\\ngoing to the German empire and i think yeah parts\\xa0\\xa0 to Russia and maybe even Austro Hungarian but\\xa0\\ni might be wrong there it was a crazy time\\xa0\\xa0 back then when massive powers were\\xa0\\nmassive future industrial potential\\xa0\\xa0 we're vying for the future of Europe and\\xa0\\ntherefore later in the

       " 'we all know the great colonial empires\\nof Britain France or Spain it was super trendy back in the day to\\nhave colonies so basically everyone wanted some but do you know anything\\nabout the colonial ventures of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth? The Polish nobility was very interested in these money machines but the kings were not\\nreally keen of this idea so one dude with some money and enthusiasm decided\\nto act on his own this dude was Jakob Kettler, the Duke of\\nCourland and Semigallia. \"Whaat, I thought we were talking about Poland?!\" Yeah, but Courland was a puppet state and later part of the\\nPLC. So stop complaining it\\'s close enough Anyway Jakob Kettler established\\nmany trade relations with other Europeans and had one of the largest\\nmerchant fleets in Europe with this fleet he sailed across the ocean to the\\nCaribbean as earlier 1637 just as a comparison by this time Canada the 13\\ncolonies and Quebec were merely started and the new world still had lots of land\\nto offer their first working colony was New Courland on Tobago in 1639 but one\\ncolony wasn\\'t enough in 1651 Courland gained a few colonies around the gambia river. These\\ncolonies were not a waste of time and money they exported many goods and even\\nsome tropical birds. Sadly, the small Duchy couldn\\'t  hold these colonies\\nfor too long. when the duchie\\'s defences were weakened by the Northern Wars and the\\nman who made it all possible was a captive of the swedish army. In 1664 they\\nwere formally ceded to England Courland regained the island of Tobago of the\\nTreaty of Oliver in 1660 but it was abandoned at last six years later the\\nlast effort of a colony in the Caribbean was on the island of Trinidad but the\\ndream was over and the colony was abandoned in 1690 this was the end of\\nthe Couronian colonial empire and soon after the PLC was too busy fighting for\\nindependence to care about colonies in 1882 another dude named Stefan Szolc-Rogoziński wanted to found a Polish colony, even though Poland was a puppet\\nstate of the Russian Empire he did not have any permission to do such a thing\\nbut that didn\\'t stop him he led an expedition to Cameroon. This expedition\\nwas a failure but surely he would have more success in a second expedition\\nright? Nope still no luck. A third expedition never\\nhappened since he was busy being not life for the most part after 1896. After World War 1 Poland became independent again. And as every independent European\\ncountry, they wanted colonies. Sure, after not existing for hundreds of years\\none needs colonies. Well it wasn\\'t all that intense, again some influential\\nwealthy people wanted Poland to have colonies but the government not so much. By this point every corner of the world was already owned by someone so was proposed\\nthat Poland buys territories in South America or Africa suggested were places\\nin Brazil Peru Angola Liberia and a few more. Most of the proposed places even\\nalready had a Polish minority! Nothing ever really came from this idea due to\\nPoland being invaded. But imagine if the Polish government just bought a part of\\nanother nation as some sort of colony would others do a similar thing? Maybe\\nthis could have started another era of European empires and colonization. Spain\\nbuying parts of its old Empire or Sweden buying a few Caribbean islands. Maybe\\nthis comes in fashion in the future who knows however this is pretty much\\neverything I could find about the greatPolish colonial ventures I hope you enjoyed the video leave a like and subscribe for more. I am working on a few\\nthings and they are almost finished so they should be up soonish, I hope at least',\n",

I found one, some light, even there are some lamps here, searchers, there are lamps, they were once wanted for motorcycles, there were different rubber bands, not always, it's always the problem, that there are a lot of accessories for old tractors, Polish ones, but not only that, they are the same elements. As for motorcycles, it's a problem because motorcycles are more popular and more and more popular. they value junk for motorcycles, that's why we suffer, tractor drivers always have these WFM SHL headlights, it's the same as usus teams, you glass, not glass, it's known that this, it's known that there were more people willing to buy motorcycle stuff than tractor stuff, once today, here are the lamps, I saw it somewhere, someone had it done to the ussa 25 for an astronomical price considering the old reality, PLN 2,000 for two, it's already there today, but it's all gone Top, not today, it still seems like astronomy, but it's hard to find it, what are we going to see, no, I'll try something here, too, put together such a car Oh, oh PLN 5 It's an art to dig something out Hello Hello Hello, it's your joint , you haven't sold it here yet [laughter] which Hello hello hello hello hello hello Hello, where were they fighting, did they bring the engine for this Sokół to the scrapyard, and the guy threw it away and his friend took it and put it on the ramp, that's not it The guests came to take care of you or, well, I know, a month of my time it wasn't Damn, but where was it in Lubań?

We'll find out then, but it's sold. Oh, we need to check the battery. Is it charged, and we'll start it up here to make sure it's this one, and maybe we'll do a drive here, burning rubber, and what's the point, because I want to see what kind it is. is the mileage because I don't remember what the exact mileage is, I'm going to get the meter and maybe we'll check it with a meter, this isn't the measurement, we'll take it, we'll put it in, the operation is in progress, a scalpel is needed, or Wait, but the screws where do you remember, uu, there are only three of them now.

If not, because it was probably there once, but I don't remember how long it has been there, a friend of mine spotted it in the movies for quite a long time. because we didn't put it on display Because Mariusz didn't drive it all the time Mariusz says that he drives this Road King best, it's a 2011 103 cm and it's supposed to be nice, this one here but the steering wheel doesn't work Oh you, it cleans nice, look how it lights up such classes such classes there will be some space for some projects because this is not where the Sokół will be located in this room, Grzesiu, we have to start with this, we will have to start with this, but probably after the New Year, not with the topic of the Sokół and the workshop, these tools will have to be done we need to write down the tools.

THEY WON THE LARGEST NUMBER OF VOTES AND SEATS IN THE NATIONAL ELECTION. >> HE'S OFTEN CALLED A DUTCH DONALD TRUMP. HE'S VOCALLY ANTI EU, HAS VOWED TO HALT ALL IMMIGRATION, AND STOP THE REMAINING -- TO UKRAINE. >> WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT THE NETHERLANDS WILL BE FOR THE DUTCH PEOPLE AGAIN. WE WILL RESTRICT THIS ASYLUM AND TSUNAMI AND MIGRATION. PEOPLE HAVE MORE MONEY IN THEIR WALLETS AGAIN. >> ANNA STEWART IS WITH ME, NOBODY CAN BE UNDER ANY DOUBT WHAT GARRETVILLE DOERS STANDS FOR IN THE WAY HE'S DONE IT. BUT THE NUMBER OF VOTES HE GOT, THE NUMBER OF SEATS HE'S GOTTEN PARLIAMENT, IT'S QUITE CLEAR. >> MORE THAN 2 MILLION PEOPLE VOTED FOR HIM AND HIS FREEDOM PARTY, HE'S GOT NEARLY 25% OF THE SEATS IN PARLIAMENT, AND SO THIS IS GOING TO BE THE BIG THORNY QUESTION FOR THE OTHER PARTIES WHO HAVE DONE MUCH LESS WELL I, HAVE TO SAY. WILL THEY GO INTO COALITION WITH THIS PARTY? BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND THEY'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT THEY WOULD NOT, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, THEY HAVE TO OF COURSE RESPECT THAT A HUGE PORTION OF THE POPULATION OF THE NETHERLANDS HAVE VOTED FOR THIS MAN, THEY VOTED ESSENTIALLY LARGELY ON IMMIGRATION, HERE. >> ANNA STEWART, WE'RE GRATEFUL. I WANT TO -- BEG YOUR PARDON, I THOUGHT WE WERE MOVING ON. AND AS, STAY WITH ME. DON'T GO AWAY, ANNA. THERE ARE TWO -- I IS WHETHER, FALLING FROM WHATEVER YOU SAID, -- WHETHER ANYONE GOES INTO A COALITION WITH HIM AND HIS PARTY. THE SECOND, AND PERHAPS THE COROLLARY TO THAT, IS WHETHER THEY COULD, AMONGST THEMSELVES, DESPERATE PARTIES, COBBLE TOGETHER A COALITION THAT WOULD DEFEAT HIM. >> AND THEY'RE PROBABLY ALL THINKING AND TALKING ABOUT THOSE TWO SCENARIOS RIGHT NOW. CLEARLY, THE FIRST SCENARIO IS THAT THEY HAVE TO AT LEAST, ON THE FACE OF IT, TRY AND SEE WHETHER THEY CAN FORM A COALITION WITH THE PARTY THAT HAS WON THE MOST VOTES. I THINK THE SECOND LARGEST PARTY THAT'S WON HERE, WHICH IS THE GREEN LABOR ALLIANCE, HAVE FIRMLY SAID THEY WILL NEVER GO INTO GOVERNMENT WITH BRETT VILLE THERE'S, AND I THINK THEY WILL MAINTAIN THAT. SLIGHT SOFTENING OF THE OUTGOING CONSERVATIVE PARTY, ALSO A CENTRIST PARTY, WITH THOSE THEY WILL GET 81 SEATS, THAT WOULD BE A MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT, SO THAT IS POSSIBLE. THESE NEGOTIATIONS WILL LIKELY TAKE MONTHS, AND THEY WILL HAVE TO BE A SERIOUS NEGOTIATION WITH KURT VILLAGERS, PARTICULARLY OVER SOME OF HIS STANCES, FOR INSTANCE ON THE EU, HE'S VERY ANTI EU, SO HE WOULD EVEN LIKE TO SEE A REFERENDUM. THOSE NEGOTIATIONS WOULD BE REALLY TRICKY, AND REALLY WATERED DOWN THOSE POLICIES THAT SO MANY PEOPLE, PERHAPS, HAVE VOTED FOR. >> IN BRUSSELS THIS IS A NIGHTMARE ISN'T IT'S, WE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF THAT IN POLAND, -- I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT LAST ELECTION, AND TALK ABOUT EARLY ELECTIONS, AND WE'VE HAD A BIT OF IT IN HUNGARY, SLOVAKIA, BUT NOW THE FOXES IN THE CHICKEN HOUSE. >> I THINK THIS WILL BE A BIG CONCERN, -- EU PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, AND ALREADY -- RULE MURRAY IN THE PEN COULD BE DOING RATHER WELL THERE. AND THAT COULD HAVE A SEISMIC SHIFT, REALLY, FOR THE EU, SO THIS IS CERTAINLY A WARNING SHOT, PERHAPS GOVERNMENTS IN EUROPE NEED TO TAKE THE FACTS THAT IN INFLATION, COST OF LIVING CRISIS, AND INFLATION ARE REALLY HOT TOPICS THEY NEED TO GRAPPLE WITH. >> ANNA, I'M GRATEFUL, ANNA\",\n",

Two countries that are founded on Christianity. We're both free and independent members of a united Europe. But together we take our thousand year-old Christian traditions into Europe. We will never let our traditions and our culture be taken away from us. Nor our freedom! We will not let them take it from us at any cost! God bless the Polish! God bless the Hungarians! Glory to the heroes of the revolution of 56! God bless the Hungarians, with your grace and bounty! Thank you very much!\",\n",
       " 'In this video,\\nwe are still in the borderlands between Poland and the Czech Republic:\\nThe Giant Mountains also known as Karkonosze. A two and a half hours\\'\\ndrive away from Wroclaw Airport. We were based in the ski resort town called Szklarska Poreba,\\nwhere it\\'s very easy to hike out of. But today I\\'ll show you my solo hike\\nfrom the nearby village of Michalowice. A primeval forest trail leads you all the way up to the Wielki Szyszak area,\\nSmielec Pass, Labski Peak, and then something very surprising\\non the border with Czechia. Stay tuned for that! And more\\nunspoiled nature on the way back. This episode documents my 17 kilometer\\nhike and won\\'t feature any background music at all. Just the sounds of nature\\nwith a little bit of my commentary. So turn up the volume,\\nswitch the subtitles on, and enjoy. So today I\\'m hiking on my own to the Smielec Pass and Labski Peak,\\nand perhaps further if I have enough time. It\\'s beautiful.\\nThis forest is so primeval. It\\'s just wild and quiet. And I\\'ve picked a trail which shouldn\\'t be too popular, hopefully, and\\nthat\\'s my preference. This is my trail\\nup to the Smielec Pass. I\\'m pretty much in the riverbed,\\nbut it\\'s cool, I don\\'t mind. I\\'m always captivated by being\\njust alone in the woods. It\\'s crazy, but\\nthere is so much magic to it and It\\'s kind of like just a childhood thing,\\nrediscovering your innate origins or, I don\\'t know,\\njust the beginning of everything, because this is just basic.\\nMe and the forest. So in these beautiful forests, there are no bears, there are no\\nwolves, but there\\'s the lynx. And we also have here beautiful deers, obviously. Today there is supposed to be\\na thunderstorm with hail forecast. Hopefully I don\\'t get caught in it and I can enjoy the entirety\\nof this trail my entire schedule. There we\\'ve got snow. Here I am on the border between Poland / Czech Republic And this is the Smielec Pass. This is Wielki Szyszak. And that way we\\'ve got Sniezka. Nice.\\nI wish this trail was open. Sadly, I don\\'t think it is,\\nso I can\\'t go there. I\\'m just going to head over there. Hopefully the weather is OK. Beautiful lakes, ponds. And we\\'re going to have to cross a patch\\nof snow, even though this is late May. But the weather here is crazy\\nand a thunderstorm is definitely brewing At the top of what I\\nthink is Labski Szczyt. People seem to be confused. Everybody\\'s asking me. Not everybody, but ...It\\'s nice. It\\'s a bit busier here because obviously people come from nearby peaks, and the\\nCzech Republic is just over there. I find it fascinating how\\nred the color of the grass here is. It\\'s just like it looks burned,\\nbut actually it\\'s just because it was under the cover of snow for quite a while,\\nand so I think it hasn\\'t regenerated yet. Let\\'s continue. If I don\\'t get soaked and caught up in the\\nthunderstorm, it\\'s going to be a miracle, I think I\\'m glad it\\'s not very busy. As I\\'ve told you before,\\nI love just going on my own. Or with Pato, obviously,\\nbut I don\\'t really like crowds. This is what we call\\nWielki Szyszak up there. I don\\'t know if you can see on the top of that mountain, Wielki Szyszak,\\nand the Czech Republic is behind me. Beautiful plains and hills\\nof the Czech Republic. But what I love the most\\nis this drop down here. These aren\\'t high mountains. This is just about 1600 meters. Just under 1600 meters. They are actually quite a hike. They give you quite a hike. This is an old TV and radio station. On top of the mountain. This is like 1600 meters above the sea level. Look at this weather. Yeah, it looks beautiful. And to be honest with you,\\nI\\'m not sure if it\\'s still operating. I will look into it. I just haven\\'t had the time to check. Time for me to go...\\nto head back because this weather is a bit scary! I quite like the fact that there is\\na sign with P for Poland in that direction. Cos I suppose I\\'m just now on the Czech Republic side, on the Czech side. Nice. There in the distance there\\'s a nice trail as well to Szrenica. Szrenica is there. But I\\'m going to head this way. This is the Yellow Trail,\\nwhich is going to take me to the... ...the shelter under Labski Szczyt. Labski Peak. It says 30 minutes so that\\'s cool. So I\\'ve just heard a thunder roll and I\\'m getting excited\\nabout that because it\\'s a bit scary. But it\\'s beautiful, it\\'s quiet. I just love it. Let\\'s see what this journey brings. I\\'m now approaching the mountain shelter. Labski Szczyt. Under Labski Peak mountain shelter. It\\'s nice. It\\'s beautiful here. And into the forest I go. Have a look. There we are. Let\\'s see how it\\'s going to be this time. And I haven\\'t got caught up in the rain or the thunderstorm yet, but it\\'s\\ndefinitely brewing just above me. So I did get caught in the rain\\neventually, but it\\'s okay. Just making my way out of the forest. It\\'s very, very thick. So that\\'s the protection I have. I don\\'t think I\\'m going to be soaking wet. Beautiful. Let\\'s get out. This is the famous waterfall \\'Szklarka\\' going to show you a bit more of it in a second because it\\'s actually\\nmostly accessible from here. Show you in a sec. This is the waterfall\\nthat I wanted to show you. It\\'s called \"Wodospad Szklarki\". As a bonus. I\\'m just going to mention here that it just so happened that it was my father\\'s\\nbirthday and so I brought him out here as I knew that he would enjoy forest\\nwalks and this beautiful scenery. This one, for example, is a short and very accessible\\nwalk to the Szklarka waterfall. But in general, the Polish Karkonosze\\ndo require a good level of fitness. It\\'s useful to note here, though,\\nthat the trails on the Czech side of the Karkanosze National Park are much\\nless steep and perhaps more suited to all. And for those who may not be able to walk or hike or trek for miles\\nand miles on end. There are several cable\\ncars to enjoy in this area. This one, for example, goes to the top\\nof Szrenica and it\\'s super fun. And here we are in a place\\ncalled Golden View. As you can see, it\\'s very busy, because it\\'s one of those must see places. And thank you for watching our videos.

       " 'Hi, thanks for tuning in. Today, I’ll show you how to search for connections and buy tickets on Polish Railways network. Ticketing system has come a long way to make purchases simpler but there are still some flaws, especially for a foreigner, but I’m here to talk all about them. Let’s jump right into it. So, the traditional way of doing it would be to go to the station, look for the paper timetable available on pretty much every platform and look for the train you like. I agree, this isn’t very convenient and the information is also limited to show only the services stopping at the station, not ideal. At every sort-of busy station you can also find a ticket office, obviously, you could ask the person there about the connection you want to make. Assuming the employee knows English, you could easily get the information you want, but still it isn’t very convenient as you would still have to make a trip to the station. Of course, Internet is here to help with more than enough journey planners for your trip. Note, that I will be covering the rail part only, I don’t have enough experience with buses to talk about them. Back to the topic. The first website you would want to visit is Portal Pasażera. Let’s talk about everything other than the journey planner first. The least exciting function is poster timetables. Simply enter the name of the station and download a PDF file of what interests you. Useful when you don’t fancy a trip to the station, but limitations stay the same. Next up are delays and disruptions, quite self-explanatory. Different options do exactly what you may think they do. Worth to know, that they are available. My favorite option to use while looking up any potential delays is find a train. Even if you don’t remember its number, you can find it by displaying the departure board and clicking on it. So here we are, back on the home page. This journey planner can be used for all sorts of trips including international also it features all carriers, so it can be used for almost every trip you want to make. Using it is pretty straight-forward, simply fill out the form and click search, Direct connections checkbox might be selected by default, be aware that some connections might not be possible without a transfer. These are our search results. A side note, a passenger train is a service calling at every stop on its route, just like regio. Clicking “connection details” will present you all of the information you need. This will be useful when buying the ticket, checking delays and getting around on the station. We will come back to this view later. The next website we’re going to visit is intercity.pl. This is a website of a national operator of long-distance services. I really recommend reading the “for passengers” section as it features important information about your trip. In this video I will cover one section called “our trains”. So, the carrier runs 4 categories of services. In general, express intercity premium, EIP, as the name suggests, should be the fastest and most comfortable, but also the most expensive. A complete opposite is TLK with low prices and old stock. In reality, prices are calculated by demand, with more tickets sold, the pricier they get. That’s why Intercity or IC and TLK are usually priced the same and the only difference is that some services are more popular and more expensive. Express Intercity or EIC usually are faster and more expensive than Intercity. Also pricing doesn’t always make sense, sometimes 1st class will be cheaper than 2nd, so check whether it’s the case with your connection. The journey planner is even simpler than the previous one. It can be used for international travel, but it only displays services run by PKP Intercity, so only these 4 categories I talked about earlier. After filling out the form take a look at the search results. Pictograms displayed after choosing a connection will tell you something about the train’s standard. PKP Intercity is the only carrier in Poland which allows to reserve your seat on every train. During COVID pandemic, seat reservation is compulsory and passengers without them will be fined. Intercity allows you to choose your seat from a schematic on some services, but it’s not always available. In this kind of situation I will show you a trick later into the video which will help you find your preferred seat and coach number. Next up is koleo.pl. A journey planner which function-wise is a simplified version of Portal Pasażera. It might not be really useful for just searching connections, but we will need it later to buy our train tickets. Take a look at the supported carriers list. You will be able to buy tickets for these companies’ services. Don’t worry other trains will pop up in the search results, but with wrong or no prices. As you can see you cannot buy PKP Intercity tickets, but other connections work just fine. I already mentioned a trick which allows you to see what coach and seat number you want to reserve. This is exactly what this site is about. . Let’s start from the homepage of vagonweb.cz. What we want to see is train formations. Select the country and service you want to see. Let’s say I want to check the train composition of IC Piast, so I input the name and click search. There are two entries, the only difference between them is the direction. Try out the features yourself, take a look on the seat map, pictures of the coach and pictograms underneath the car’s name. Note, that coaches stay the same most of the time but they can be in different order. That’s all what I had to show you for searching connections, now let’s buy the tickets. The last moment you can buy the ticket is on a train itself. You will need to find a train conductor, tell him where you’re going and he’ll sell you one. I think this is the worst method of purchasing a ticket as you will be charged extra for several things. Primarily, if your departure station has an open ticket office, a fee from 3 to 10 zloty depending on the carrier will be added. During pandemic PKP Intercity will not sell you a ticket onboard. In this situation the procedure is as follows, first you will need to pay for the section you travelled on, then a fee of 130 zloty will be added and then you will be kicked out on the next stop. Express Intercity Premium does that too, even not in a pandemic. To avoid these fees, visit a ticket office and buy the ticket there. They are available at every busier station. If the office is closed, you’re mostly safe, BUT that doesn’t apply to PKP Intercity which doesn’t care if it’s closed and still requires you to have a valid ticket with a seat reservation before boarding. Ticket machines are more rare and basically serve the same function as ticket offices but usually with smaller wait time. Be aware that they will sell you tickets for only local operators and the only long-distance one, so you might not be able to buy a ticket for the whole journey. I think internet does these things better, so I will now show you some websites which allow you to buy tickets online. First, we return to koleo. You have to register an account to make purchases, it’s quite a simple process. After logging-in select the connection and proceed according to on-screen instructions. Your ticket will be accessible in a form of a QR code available on the website and sent to you in an e-mail. I suggest downloading a smartphone app for easier ticket purchases on the go and easier access to your tickets. . For those of you who will be travelling with PKP Intercity, the best website to purchase your tickets from is their own. After choosing a connection, fill out the form on bottom. Be sure to choose class and set up seat reservation to your liking. As an example I would like to travel in this car in particular, I can input the seat and coach number into the form and hope for the best or just choose a non-compartment coach. There is no way to know for sure where are you going to end up, but there is one secret. At the time of preparing this video, system fills the train from its center towards edges. Knowing this you could more or less predict where your assigned seat would be. Next steps are the same as in koleo with one change, that you don’t need an account. In this case, your ticket will be emailed to you. Some carriers do not sell tickets on koleo and you need to buy them on their own website. A prime example is Koleje Śląskie. Their ticket purchasing system doesn’t differ all that much from the other, after all, it serves the same function. The last website worth checking out will be useful only for people travelling with more than one carrier. It has a special fare which reduces a cost of a ticket for connection PKP Intercity + regional. (or regional + regional) Sadly, this works for only small portion of carriers. Let me show you. This is the offer I talked about, price has been reduced by approximately 10%. Not much, but worth in my opinion. Next steps are exactly the same as before. Now that’s how you buy tickets like a local! Hopefully you learnt something new. Please consider subscribing and clicking the like button and I’ll see you on the rails.',\n",

       " 'Hello everyone, it\\'s me again. I\\'ve been here for a month because I\\'m trying to catch up at the same time. I don\\'t want to leave you either, because Eurovisioon is where we are all connected by love. I try to be with you and react as much as I can. I hope you forgive me for what happened. Today I will react to Poland\\'s song. Poland was in my Top 3 last year. Ochman was a very high end song. I don\\'t know what song was chosen this year. I don\\'t know about the act and the songs. All I know is, people have been uprising since last night. They people said: \\'Don\\'t let send the song go\\', \\'we didn\\'t vote for this song\\', \\'she deliberately won the first place in the jury\\'. Blanka\\'s boyfriend\\'s mother is said to be the head of the jury and the choreographer is on the jury. There are also injustices, let\\'s see maybe it can be canceled. If they (TVP) did this, I don\\'t think anything would change anyway. Most likely Blanka will represent Poland the song \\'Solo\\'. When I see the girl, I think it\\'s a moving song. I don\\'t want to keep you waiting too long, so let\\'s listen to the song right away. Blanka, \\'Solo\\' Poland 2023 with you... Her name... For a moment, I felt like a lollipop would come. What\\'s this ? She tried to look like Ariana Grande. Her voice is so bad. Who made this girl winner? Her voice is so bad. What song is this? I have to go  wild! What\\'s this ? To bad Did they listen to it and earn it? Did they listen to this song and earn it? Just because the girl is beautiful.. I\\'m telling you very clearly, he definitely won by cheating. My guess is that... Stage show, voice and song the girl has no chance to be the win with this voice. If the Polish people chose this song, do not participate. You determine by internal selection. The voice is so bad, it doesn\\'t match the song at all. It\\'s like trying to cover a song that has been made before. The song is already bad, what is it? I can\\'t say anything. Even I\\'m going to apologize for subjecting you to this. I\\'m not apologizing, Poland should apologize for making you listen to this. What\\'s this ? Is the Efendi? (Azerbaijan 2021) Same Efendi. Everything was stolen. I think the song was stolen, it\\'s a very classic song. The choreography was collected from somewhere, the sound is bad. How did you choose this? You are Poland, you choose Ochman last year. Soo baad! The girl herself can not keep up with the song. Do i have a mistake? Music is very simple. No such thing. A little… I can\\'t talk long about this song. I\\'m going to waste my time unfortunately. Ok, the girl is beautiful. The choreography is \\'garbage\\', sorry.  She stole the choreography, and the Master did the same. Efendi the same! You\\'re scribbling in your friend\\'s notebook, change it a bit. I waited for \\'Lollipop\\' or \\'Barbie\\' throughout the song. The outfit is ok! The song and music are bad. The simplest music in the world right here. Congratulations to whoever made your arrangement, I wish you had never worked so hard, it\\'s a waste of your time. This song is not suitable for that voice. It does not examine the voice, it cannot rise. I don\\'t get it, he doesn\\'t use his voice. How can you achieve success in the song? I wish you hadn\\'t participed If you were second, you would say, \"Yes, I was second\" and continue on your way, you are spoken in the country right now. I give so much credit to the Polish people.  Why did you make her win? She got the victory with cheating I\\'m sure I\\'m not saying anything, I can\\'t waste any more of my time on this song. The sound, the choreography, the song are bad. That\\'s all I have to say. This is how Poland… I\\'ve never been happy. I vomited a little hate, I\\'m happy. I\\'m sorry, nobody, don\\'t tell me \\'the song is very good\\' with this song. She\\'s already eliminated from the voice. What are you thinking? Do you think this girl cheated?

       " 'With economic stature in tatters after\\xa0\\nWorld War II, Poland was on the brink\\xa0\\xa0 of crashing. Now, almost a century later,\\xa0\\nit\\'s primed to become the \"Next Germany\". Previously, a free-market economy with\\xa0\\nagricultural richness, was doomed to\\xa0\\xa0 economic despair after the initiation of\\xa0\\ncommunist rule in the 1940s. Fast forward\\xa0\\xa0 to the 21st century, and we\\'re witnessing\\xa0\\nan economic boost that is off the charts.\\xa0 What transpired this miraculous change?\\nThe war is not only chaotic on the battlefield\\xa0\\xa0 when lives are lost, but the chaos seeps through\\xa0\\nthe bloodbath and toward the times of peace. For\\xa0\\xa0 Poland, it was the beginning of another war,\\xa0\\nthe economic salvation. The war had exacted\\xa0\\xa0 a heavy toll on the nation, leading to immense\\xa0\\nloss of life, widespread destruction, and the\\xa0\\xa0 displacement of millions. The Yalta Conference\\xa0\\nof 1945, which divided Europe into spheres of\\xa0\\xa0 influence, placed Poland in the Soviet orbit.\\nWith Poland in tatters, it found itself under the\\xa0\\xa0 communist rule. Once, the land of fields filled\\xa0\\nwith agricultural richness was left with gray,\\xa0\\xa0 decaying buildings, and a sense of economic\\xa0\\ndespair characterized the landscape. The\\xa0\\xa0 communist regime introduced a planned economy,\\xa0\\nwhich stifled innovation and left the nation with\\xa0\\xa0 low expectations and a challenging way of life.\\nIt continued for another decade, and in came\\xa0\\xa0 the 1970s. In an otherwise disco era, the\\xa0\\nPolish economy further deteriorated to an\\xa0\\xa0 unimaginable level. Growth was hampered\\xa0\\nby outdated industrial infrastructure,\\xa0\\xa0 government subsidies that concealed inefficiencies\\xa0\\nin production, and artificially high wages that\\xa0\\xa0 needed to align with productivity. By the late\\xa0\\n1980s, these issues had precipitated an economic\\xa0\\xa0 crisis characterized by a ballooning government\\xa0\\ndeficit and hyperinflation. At this time,\\xa0\\xa0 you might wonder, \"How did Poland gather itself\"?\\nIn sports, we talk about comebacks and\\xa0\\xa0 change-defining moments. Like Michael Jordan\\'s\\xa0\\nfamous slam dunk in 1987, Poland was desperate\\xa0\\xa0 for a miracle. And post-communist era\\xa0\\nis when the recovery began. But let\\'s\\xa0\\xa0 stay within a reasonable distance.\\nIn the immediate post-communist era,\\xa0\\xa0 Poland found itself at a crossroads. The planned\\xa0\\neconomy, a hallmark of the communist regime,\\xa0\\xa0 had left the nation with an antiquated industrial\\xa0\\ninfrastructure, inefficiency masked by government\\xa0\\xa0 subsidies, and high wages relative to\\xa0\\nproductivity. These lingering issues had\\xa0\\xa0 created economic stagnation and instability.\\xa0\\nThe need for change was clear, but the path\\xa0\\xa0 forward needed to be clarified. And just like\\xa0\\na patient who\\'s in v-fib, it needed a shock\\xa0\\xa0 treatment or, in other words, a \"shock therapy.\"\\nThe founder of shock therapy, Leszek Balcerowicz\\'s\\xa0\\xa0 vision was revolutionary. He recognized that\\xa0\\nPoland\\'s transition to a market-oriented\\xa0\\xa0 economy required a bold and unconventional\\xa0\\napproach. Its objectives were twofold, i.e.,\\xa0\\xa0 to control rampant hyperinflation and expedite\\xa0\\nPoland\\'s shift towards a market economy.\\xa0\\xa0 Balcerowicz\\'s plan was akin to a defibrillator\\xa0\\nfor Poland\\'s ailing economy – a shock to the\\xa0\\xa0 system to jumpstart the transformation.\\nThe key components of this plan comprised\\xa0\\xa0 heavy decisions. We mentioned that Poland is in a\\xa0\\nwar after the world war. Due to this plan, Poland\\xa0\\xa0 lost the battle but was able to win the war,\\xa0\\nas we will see in the latter half of the video.\\xa0 Wage Freeze: The plan included the freezing of\\xa0\\nwages, a necessary measure to curb hyperinflation\\xa0\\xa0 and realign salaries with economic reality. This\\xa0\\ndecision was a tough pill for many, but it was a\\xa0\\xa0 fundamental step in stabilizing the economy.\\nPrice Deregulation: Another vital aspect of\\xa0\\xa0 the plan was the removal of price controls.\\xa0\\nThis move allowed market forces to determine\\xa0\\xa0 prices, fostering competition and\\xa0\\nefficiency in various industries.\\xa0 Subsidy Phase-Out: State-owned enterprises\\xa0\\nhad long relied on government subsidies to\\xa0\\xa0 stay afloat, often perpetuating inefficiency.\\xa0\\nThe Balcerowicz Plan gradually phased out\\xa0\\xa0 these subsidies, compelling these entities to\\xa0\\noperate more independently and competitively.\\xa0 Promotion of Private Enterprise: The plan paved\\xa0\\nthe way for large-scale private enterprise,\\xa0\\xa0 promoting the growth of a private sector that\\xa0\\nwould drive economic innovation and development.\\xa0 The Balcerowicz Plan marked the beginning of\\xa0\\na transformative journey for Poland. It was a\\xa0\\xa0 testament to the country\\'s ability to embrace\\xa0\\nchange and adapt to new economic realities. In\\xa0\\xa0 1999, when Poland joined NATO, on March\\xa0\\n12, 1999. The Polish government claims\\xa0\\xa0 that since accession to NATO, the Polish\\xa0\\narmed forces have become \"a catalyst of\\xa0\\xa0 change.\" Something to ponder, isn\\'t it?\\nResilience and Growth has Been the\\xa0\\xa0 Hallmark of Poland\\'s Quest for Economic Supremacy\\nPoland\\'s history is uniquely marred by bloodshed,\\xa0\\xa0 making the nation exceptionally sensitive\\xa0\\nto external threats. Recent provocative\\xa0\\xa0 statements by Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy\\xa0\\nchairman of Russia\\'s Security Council,\\xa0\\xa0 have only heightened this sensitivity. Not to\\xa0\\nmention that the war on Ukraine also added an\\xa0\\xa0 unwanted struggle for the Polish government to\\xa0\\ntake their economic development to the next level.\\xa0 However, it turned out that, like in any\\xa0\\nother sporting arena, the game is never\\xa0\\xa0 won when the odds are with you. The fun is\\xa0\\nwhen you beat those odds and come out on top!\\xa0 These geopolitical circumstances didn\\'t hinder\\xa0\\nPoland\\'s struggle to be at the top among its\\xa0\\xa0 neighbors. But the level of composure shown by\\xa0\\nPoland during almost a century of unrest made this\\xa0\\xa0 country a giant in the European Union. A stray\\xa0\\nmissile landed in a Polish border town last week,\\xa0\\xa0 killing two people. Some European leaders\\xa0\\nworried as much about how Poland\\'s right-wing\\xa0\\xa0 government would react as they did about the\\xa0\\npossibility that Russia had ordered the strike.\\xa0 Poland\\'s longstanding distrust of all things\\xa0\\nRussian and the current government\\'s deep\\xa0\\xa0 antipathy toward Moscow triggered concern\\xa0\\nfrom Brussels to Berlin that Warsaw might\\xa0\\xa0 do something rash. Instead of losing\\xa0\\nits nerve, however, Warsaw was stoical,\\xa0\\xa0 placing its armed forces on alert while keeping\\xa0\\nits powder dry until there was clarity about\\xa0\\xa0 what happened. (The conclusion is that it was an\\xa0\\nair defense missile fired by Ukraine to protect\\xa0\\xa0 itself from a Russian attack that went astray.)\\nThat\\'s just one thing that they have done since\\xa0\\xa0 Russia attacked Ukraine. Poland has\\xa0\\nbeen a constant supporter of Ukraine,\\xa0\\xa0 which has further increased its visibility on the\\xa0\\nglobal scale. They have consistently shown that\\xa0\\xa0 you can\\'t win battles by aligning yourself with\\xa0\\npowerhouses like Russia or the U.S. You need to\\xa0\\xa0 be strong and independent without any assistance\\xa0\\nto make an impact. To some extent, it\\'s poetic\\xa0\\xa0 how Poland has made of itself among powerhouses.\\nUnfortunately, that\\'s not where the story ends.\\xa0 Amidst such challenging geopolitical\\xa0\\ncircumstances, Poland has undertaken a massive\\xa0\\xa0 rearmament program, underscoring its determination\\xa0\\nto safeguard its sovereignty and strategic\\xa0\\xa0 interests. Notably, Poland recently finalized a\\xa0\\n£1.9 billion deal for British CAMMs air defense\\xa0\\xa0 missiles, adding to its growing arsenal. With a\\xa0\\ndefense budget of $30 billion, constituting 4.25%\\xa0\\xa0 of its GDP – the highest proportion within NATO –\\xa0\\nPoland\\'s rearmament is nothing short of a fervent\\xa0\\xa0 spending spree that will substantially\\xa0\\nreshape the balance of power in Europe.\\xa0 When discussing balance of power, it can get\\xa0\\ncloudy, especially in Europe. Each country\\xa0\\xa0 belonging to extended Europe is excelling in one\\xa0\\nway or another. Russia is already a superpower,\\xa0\\xa0 Sweden is already a technological hub, and\\xa0\\nwe all know what the U.K. is capable of.\\xa0\\xa0 But hardly anybody didn\\'t write off Poland.\\xa0\\nIn 1989, Polish workers had a GDP per capita\\xa0\\xa0 of just a tenth of their German counterparts.\\nThree decades of steady growth has wrought a\\xa0\\xa0 miracle. The economic disparities have narrowed\\xa0\\ndramatically. Adjusted for purchasing parity,\\xa0\\xa0 GDP per head in Poland is now £28,200\\xa0\\ncompared with £35,000 in the U.K.,\\xa0\\xa0 £34,200 in France and £39,800 in Germany. At its\\xa0\\ncurrent trajectory rate, Poland will overtake the\\xa0\\xa0 U.K. by 2030. Since the millennium, Poland\\'s real\\xa0\\nGDP per capita has more than doubled; by contrast,\\xa0\\xa0 GDP per capita in Britain, France, and Germany\\xa0\\ngrew between 15pc and 24pc over the same period.\\xa0 Further, Poland\\'s rearmament efforts encompass\\xa0\\na range of acquisitions that underscore the\\xa0\\xa0 nation\\'s commitment to defense. From procuring\\xa0\\n250 American M1A2 Abrams tanks to 500 HIMARS\\xa0\\xa0 systems and 96 Apache attack helicopters,\\xa0\\nPoland is on track to possess Europe\\'s most\\xa0\\xa0 formidable land army by the end of the decade.\\xa0\\nThis transformation is significant, harkening back\\xa0\\xa0 to Poland\\'s historical role as a great power.\\nThe strategic rationale behind this surge in\\xa0\\xa0 military acquisitions is multifaceted. Russia\\'s\\xa0\\nperformance in the ongoing Ukraine conflict,\\xa0\\xa0 while not overwhelmingly successful, has\\xa0\\ndemonstrated its capacity to prolong the\\xa0\\xa0 war for an extended period. This prolonged\\xa0\\nconflict would inevitably lead to significant\\xa0\\xa0 logistical challenges for the West, depleting\\xa0\\nthe available material for Ukraine. In response,\\xa0\\xa0 Poland\\'s military leadership remains resolute,\\xa0\\nleaving no room for complacency. General Rajmund\\xa0\\xa0 Andrzejczak, the Chief of the Polish General\\xa0\\nStaff, emphasized the urgency of their efforts,\\xa0\\xa0 noting that they have the financial\\xa0\\nmeans to secure essential weaponry. The answer to the question is that they\\'re already\\xa0\\ndoing it. Even though they are facing inflation\\xa0\\xa0 like any other country, post-pandemic, the cost\\xa0\\nof living is cheaper than that of Paris, London,\\xa0\\xa0 and Berlin. Imagine having an inflation\\xa0\\nrate of 15% (double the average of E.U.),\\xa0\\xa0 but the people are happier there. For\\xa0\\ninstance, rental prices in Wrocław are\\xa0\\xa0 approximately one-fifth of those in\\xa0\\nLondon, and a pint of beer at a local\\xa0\\xa0 bar won\\'t set you back much more than £1.\\nPerhaps economists or historians of the\\xa0\\xa0 far future won\\'t look at the figures at a\\xa0\\ncellular level, but on a larger scale – they\\xa0\\xa0 are thriving. Polish had to work an average of\\xa0\\n1830 hours a year, more than Americans, British,\\xa0\\xa0 French, and even Germans. Finally, their hard\\xa0\\nwork is reaping awards. Yes, its counterparts\\xa0\\xa0 still consider Poland a poor country, but\\xa0\\nat this rate, they will be at the top.\\xa0 Another point to ponder is its military strength\\xa0\\nhas gone from strength to strength, evolving\\xa0\\xa0 from its post-communist roots into a formidable\\xa0\\nforce that commands respect not only domestically\\xa0\\xa0 but on the international stage as well.\\nToday, Poland\\'s military boasts a strength\\xa0\\xa0 of approximately 150,000 personnel, with\\xa0\\na notable addition of 30,000 troops in a\\xa0\\xa0 territorial defense force established\\xa0\\nin 2017. These territorial troops,\\xa0\\xa0 often dubbed \"weekend soldiers,\" complete 16\\xa0\\ndays of training, followed by refresher courses,\\xa0\\xa0 a concept initially met with skepticism. However,\\xa0\\nUkraine\\'s successful use of mobile militias armed\\xa0\\xa0 with anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles has\\xa0\\nturned this idea into a sensible strategy.\\xa0\\xa0 And they\\'re not even confined to holding on to\\xa0\\ninvestments to bolster their defense. Notable\\xa0\\xa0 deals include a £4.9 billion agreement with the\\xa0\\nU.S. for 250 Abrams tanks and the acquisition\\xa0\\xa0 of U.S. F-16s. In 2020, Poland signed a $4.6\\xa0\\nbillion deal for 32 F-35 fighters, marking a\\xa0\\xa0 significant stride in its air force capabilities.\\nA substantial portion of its recent military\\xa0\\xa0 expenditures has been directed towards\\xa0\\nKorea, with agreements spanning tanks,\\xa0\\xa0 aircraft, and other arms. Notably, Poland has\\xa0\\nordered approximately $10 billion to $12 billion\\xa0\\xa0 worth of weaponry from Korea, and the future\\xa0\\npromises a continuous supply of military hardware. There are no upsets in real life, only\\xa0\\nperseverance and determination. Poland\\'s\\xa0\\xa0 political and economic struggles seem\\xa0\\nlike they happened centuries ago. Alas,\\xa0\\xa0 this is the making of a true nation. Did the\\xa0\\nhard yards, at times, find themselves on the\\xa0\\xa0 wrong end of negative remarks but persevered\\xa0\\n– showcasing how much it evolved since the\\xa0\\xa0 turbulent post-world-war era. However, \"Goal 2030\"\\xa0\\nis still a long way to go. Yes, Poland is on the\\xa0\\xa0 right track, but only time will tell whether\\xa0\\nthey can be a powerhouse or stay a dark horse.',\n",
       " \"In this video, I will review some of\\xa0\\nthe essential updates on PeerBerry,\\xa0\\xa0 which may affect your investing\\xa0\\nexperience in the future. This is not a review of PeerBerry, if you want\\xa0\\nto learn more about how the platform works,\\xa0\\xa0 you can watch a video I made two years ago\\xa0\\nor read our PeerBerry review on P2P Empire. While the loan originators\\xa0\\nchange on PeerBerry frequently,\\xa0\\xa0 the functionality remains more or less the same. Today, I will be covering the end\\xa0\\nof Polish loans on PeerBerry, new\\xa0\\xa0 investment opportunities as well as the decrease\\xa0\\nin interest rates for the Aventus group loans. As you might know already,\\xa0\\xa0 PeerBerry is in the process of delisting\\xa0\\nall Polish loans by the end of the year. All your current investments\\xa0\\nin Poland will be repurchased,\\xa0\\xa0 and your money will be returned\\xa0\\nto you with the accrued interest. We are working with our Polish lenders for more\\xa0\\nthan six years already. All the time in Poland,\\xa0\\xa0 there are some changes, regulations and\\xa0\\ninterest caps, etc. It’s not a surprise\\xa0\\xa0 to us at all. But from now, the 1st of\\xa0\\nJanuary next year, there are, I would say,\\xa0\\xa0 some big changes and our partners cannot\\xa0\\nfund the lending business in Poland anymore. We have been preparing for this for\\xa0\\nquite some time and we are working\\xa0\\xa0 with our Polish companies. We are decreasing\\xa0\\nthe investments in Polish lenders for three to\\xa0\\xa0 four months and our investors can probably\\xa0\\nsee it. And from the end of this year,\\xa0\\xa0 we will not offer investments into Polish\\xa0\\ncompanies. So this is the biggest change. If you want to watch the full\\xa0\\ninterview with the CEO at PeerBerry,\\xa0\\xa0 it’s available for members\\xa0\\non buymeacoffee.com/p2pempire So basically, the new regulation\\xa0\\nin Poland doesn’t allow lenders\\xa0\\xa0 to fund their loan books with P2P investors. PeerBerry has been aware\\xa0\\nof this change for several\\xa0\\xa0 months and has explored all the legal options. The lenders in Poland will continue\\xa0\\nto fund their lending portfolios from\\xa0\\xa0 their own capital to fully comply\\xa0\\nwith the new regulations in Poland. Some other market players have a\\xa0\\ndifferent interpretation of the law. For example, Lonvest informed me that\\xa0\\ntheir lender works with a card product\\xa0\\xa0 and has a small payment institution license\\xa0\\nfor which the new restrictions don’t apply. The CEO at PeerBerry told me that\\xa0\\nthe regulator might amend the\\xa0\\xa0 law to include some workarounds,\\xa0\\nsuch as issuing loans via cards,\\xa0\\xa0 which makes funding from investors in\\xa0\\nPoland not a sustainable strategy anymore. According to the legal opinion from the Aventus\\xa0\\nteam, any funding via investors is prohibited.\\xa0\\xa0 The non-compliance puts the lender at risk\\xa0\\nof losing the relevant license in Poland. The result of the delisting of\\xa0\\nPolish loans on PeerBerry is\\xa0\\xa0 a decrease of 17 million euro\\xa0\\nunder PeerBerry’s management. The Polish portfolio represents\\xa0\\nabout 17% of the assets,\\xa0\\xa0 meaning there will be even more\\xa0\\ncash drag in the short term. As Aventus Group has been preparing\\xa0\\nfor this event for quite some time,\\xa0\\xa0 the group will introduce a new business loan to\\xa0\\nreplace some of the loan volumes from Poland. The new business loan will likely have a loan term\\xa0\\nbetween 3 and 6 months and an interest rate of 9%. The investments in those loans\\xa0\\nshould be repaid on time as they\\xa0\\xa0 will be cleared automatically\\xa0\\nat the end of the loan term. The funds will finance the portfolios\\xa0\\nof newly launched companies in emerging\\xa0\\xa0 markets such as Mexico, Colombia,\\xa0\\nSouth Africa, Nigeria, and Tanzania. As soon as the lending portfolios\\xa0\\nin those markets are large enough,\\xa0\\xa0 they will also be listed as\\xa0\\nindividual lenders on PeerBerry. Outside of those new companies, Aventus\\xa0\\nis also launching new brands in the\\xa0\\xa0 Philippines and Romania, which will\\xa0\\nbe listed on PeerBerry next year. The lending volumes from Poland\\xa0\\nshould be replaced with new\\xa0\\xa0 investment opportunities sometime\\xa0\\nduring the first quarter of 2024. It’s not the first time that lenders on\\xa0\\nPeerBerry will be delisted. The Aventus\\xa0\\xa0 Group left Vietnam earlier this year\\xa0\\ndue to extreme regulatory challenges. Last year, PeerBerry lost the lending\\xa0\\nportfolios from Russia and Ukraine as\\xa0\\xa0 the war broke out, which created a much\\xa0\\nbigger hole of about 50 million euro. The Polish portfolio will not be lost,\\xa0\\nthe lenders will continue operating,\\xa0\\xa0 and they will remain part of\\xa0\\nthe group guarantee, which,\\xa0\\xa0 as many of you know, is a very reliable\\xa0\\nsecurity system for PeerBerry investors. Currently, Aventus Group’s portfolio\\xa0\\namounts to 217 million euros. The\\xa0\\xa0 portfolio of Polish lenders\\xa0\\nmakes up 46,73 million euro,\\xa0\\xa0 and the forecasted profit of Polish lenders\\xa0\\nfor 2023 is 22 million euro before taxes. So having the lenders from\\xa0\\nPoland in the group guarantee,\\xa0\\xa0 despite not offering any loans on PeerBerry,\\xa0\\nis a benefit for investors as those lenders\\xa0\\xa0 will provide the backing of all the\\xa0\\nnew lenders in emerging markets. Aventus Group is the only financial group that\\xa0\\xa0 repaid almost all war-affected loans to\\xa0\\nits investors via its group guarantee. This, of course, created more\\xa0\\ntrust and confidence in the\\xa0\\xa0 lender’s ability to protect investors'\\xa0\\nfunds even during black swan events. Most other platforms came up with excuses\\xa0\\nas to why they won’t repay the money. Due to Aventus honoring the group guarantee,\\xa0\\xa0 PeerBerry’s lending volumes\\xa0\\nreached pre-war levels. Even though Aventus is expanding quickly, it\\xa0\\nstill cannot meet investors’ investment demand. There are specific key metrics that lenders follow\\xa0\\nto be able to fund loans from investors. This is\\xa0\\xa0 connected to the portfolio's performance,\\xa0\\nscorecards in new markets, and leverage. On some other platforms, you might\\xa0\\nfind lenders with dubious management\\xa0\\xa0 and questionable payment morale;\\xa0\\nthis isn’t the case on PeerBerry. PeerBerry users and the Aventus group\\xa0\\nare aware of that, so the group will\\xa0\\xa0 decrease the interest rate again,\\xa0\\nwhich might upset some investors. From a business perspective, it makes total\\xa0\\nsense. If the demand from investors is high,\\xa0\\xa0 lenders lower the interest rate\\xa0\\nto decrease the funding costs. Additionally, the risk for investors is being\\xa0\\xa0 lowered with the strongest buyback\\xa0\\nand group guarantee in the industry. So, you should expect a lower loan supply\\xa0\\xa0 and a lower interest rate on\\xa0\\nPeerBerry in the near future. Now, you might be wondering what to do. Should\\xa0\\nyou stay on PeerBerry or look elsewhere? The Polish lenders have been some\\xa0\\xa0 of the financially strongest\\xa0\\ncompanies operating in Europe. Exposing your funds to various market\\xa0\\nrisks in emerging countries might not\\xa0\\xa0 be something investors will be happy about. I will not be telling you what to do. This channel\\xa0\\nis not about giving investment advice; it’s about\\xa0\\xa0 presenting you with investment opportunities\\xa0\\nas well as the risks that you must consider. Everyone will have a different risk profile and\\xa0\\nexperience with P2P lending. What I can tell\\xa0\\xa0 you is my opinion and the actions I will take\\xa0\\nregarding the upcoming changes on PeerBerry. As many of you know, almost my entire portfolio\\xa0\\xa0 on PeerBerry has been exposed to\\xa0\\nPoland for most of the past year. This portfolio will be redistributed to\\xa0\\nloans from Romania, the Czech Republic,\\xa0\\xa0 and Spain and potentially also into\\xa0\\nthe newly offered business loans. PeerBerry has been able to\\xa0\\nnavigate through challenging\\xa0\\xa0 events successfully in the past few years. The management team protected investors'\\xa0\\nfunds even during the pandemic outbreak\\xa0\\xa0 or the war in Ukraine, which impacted\\xa0\\nalmost everyone who invested on PeerBerry. I expect that PeerBerry will continue to honor\\xa0\\xa0 its promises to investors and\\xa0\\nuphold all offered guarantees. At the same time, I am not putting\\xa0\\nall my eggs in the same basket. If you follow my portfolio updates, you\\xa0\\nknow that I am also invested in Esketit,\\xa0\\xa0 Crowdpear, Fintown, and Robocash. All those platforms work as expected and continue\\xa0\\nfulfilling their obligations toward investors. I know that risks can materialize anywhere and\\xa0\\xa0 that the loan availability\\xa0\\nmight sometimes be limited. Still, I prefer to be exposed to platforms with\\xa0\\xa0 insights into risk management\\xa0\\nand portfolio performance. Investing in a few good platforms is\\xa0\\na better strategy than spreading funds\\xa0\\xa0 across all the available P2P lending sites,\\xa0\\nwhich will almost certainly cause some losses,\\xa0\\xa0 not to mention the time one needs\\xa0\\nto spend researching and monitoring. If you are planning to also invest on other\\xa0\\nplatforms, consider using our affiliate links\\xa0\\xa0 on P2P Empire.

       " \"I don't know this is my girlfriend he goes hi hi welcome back to our another coffee date and today we are going to talk about di about our own experience okay let's get started dating what what's the definition of dating or relationship oh in my culture in Japan we usually say like uh after three days we can we have confession so after 3 days you or the other person will confess like would you be my girlfriend boyfriend whatever and that's how it works in Japan and in Poland from what I know sometimes you just find out after some time that you're dating my friends told me so in general do you have confession culture no I don't think so maybe it's it depends on people but mostly from what I know the people will be like oh you're dating and you never know when you started dating and how do you know your exclusive I don't know because it never happens to me because I think it's better just to say oh we dating now maybe when you meet your friends oh this is my girlfriend this is my boyriend yeah because yeah yeah yeah yeah I think so but dating means would you also date another person at the same time or only one exclusive only one like I know that people might think like other at the same time wow it's for me it's like confusing yeah for me because I would rather know if I'm in a relationship with someone or not I haven't got any relationship experience with Polish guys I went one only one day with a Polish guy and how was that he goes [Music] to for me like last date with a Polish guy it was like 5 years ago it was quite a long time ago mhm you don't have cander no we got pizza it's so much cander yeah so uh as I said in Japan we have like first three days before getting in relationship and usually I guess we wouldn't even kiss before in relationship that's I'm not sure about like adult because I was in Japan until like Bachelor so still students period in my life mhm not like uh fully adult food not in your 20s yeah yeah we maybe we hold hands but maybe not so because as I said in the last video we don't hug each other when like between friends even right this is huge move you know after confession you you could like have physical uh Al confession yeah physical move that's that's what I saw in like in dramas TV dramas mangas I know after confession you would kiss but it might take long time that's why it's like three days only three days oh so it's only always 3 days not always but after 3 days you you have to know if you like someone or not it's like so quickly how can you say but not of experience oh okay okay mine was not like after 3 days I think it might take longer than 3 days for me to say if I like something or not to be in yeah yeah because after 3 days you don't really know the person so they might pretend to be someone else at the beginning I think in Poland people kiss before dating mhm so it's not like something not something crazy yeah it's not something surprising like if someone faes you all we kiss on first dat for example how about like how you go public so for example in Japan couples wouldn't this on Street public affections affe I think people don't care here because often often you can see like people sitting on benches in planton kissing for example or anywhere in a tra stop people don't care hugging yeah hugging is I think the most basic thing to see on the streets so it's different I don't see such a thing in hand people wouldn't do it maybe just holding hands that's all maybe maybe even high but here you're also you might also feel uncomfortable when you're seeing like someone kissing on the street I don't feel comfortable often when someone's like next to me it's like depends on the level like if they are King like lightly it's but then they if they start making out like no yeah it will be un comfortable for me because I saw uh some people implanting a girl sitting on like a lap on the lap mhm I don't know how to describe this but I think like much nothing public place it's too much like seeing people making out yeah it's different from what I saw in Japan mhm how would you like to text with you person I think like a couple time maybe not a couple times a day but not too much but not like at all mhm I like like to text you when I have time but I often like I'm at work or meeting friends so for me it might take some time to reply mhm often however like text you once a day like how are you and that's it I think for me it's like no I would like to know more about like how how was his day or something like that what he's up to not too less not too much yeah the same for me for example I don't want to call every day cuz some people want to call video a but for me that's too much yeah for me so it depends where you live yeah because if you live in the same city for me it's better just to go and meet them mhm then just like video calling for me it's like want this mhm but if the person lives out of City then like sometimes con will be fine but yeah like for my friends sometimes people when they start dating they're seeing each other every single day not every day yeah so and maybe yeah in the earlier phase of the relationship not every day maybe three times a week mhm to is okay as well I want to spend that week yeah I think once or twice a week is okay after how many months would you like to live together you should set a [Music] deadline\",\n",

In fact - why\\xa0\\xa0 should Poland, a country ravaged by Germany during\\xa0\\nWorld War II, voluntarily relinquish reparations?\\xa0\\xa0 This is absurd. Therefore a legal\\xa0\\ndispute began. In this dispute,\\xa0\\xa0 one thing is certain - during World War II,\\xa0\\nGermany caused enormous harm to Poland and caused\\xa0\\xa0 losses for which it has not paid to this day.\\nGermany paid war reparations to many other\\xa0countries.\\xa0 The destruction and crimes\\xa0\\ncommitted in Poland were incomparably\\xa0greater. Is this what prompts the Germans\\xa0\\nto look for legal loopholes to avoid paying\\xa0\\xa0 reparations to Poland? Is this how a democratic\\xa0\\nstate that respects the rule of law should act?\\xa0 Today Germany is creating itself as a moral\\xa0\\nsuperpower, and if it wants to be one,\\xa0\\xa0 it should find a suitable legal form as soon as\\xa0\\npossible and compensate Poland for its war losses.\\xa0\\xa0 If Germany does not want to call it reparations,\\xa0\\nthen nothing prevents it from calling it something\\xa0else. However a step should be taken to\\xa0\\ncome to an agreement with Poland and Poles,\\xa0\\xa0 to make up for the wrongs and\\xa0\\npay the bill for World War II.',\n",
       " 'I relocated just over a year ago  More than a year ago Two years in Poznan Quite soon it will have been one year. And I’m super satisfied with my decision to relocate  Moving, is a serious step. Еven more so, if you’re moving for permanent residence. I have a family with two kids and I felt really scared. It’s never an easy experience for anybody, I’d say  No, you don’t have to be scared, but rather perk yourself up and believe that everything is going to turn out fine. If something doesn’t click, it’s not the end of the world I’m not going to die, I’ll just go back to where I came from. We are massively supported by the company. Our company makes visas for workers and for their families  It offered us a flat. You have to get the legal residence paperwork sorted. The company also helps with that. Well, the company  covered all the major expenses. I don’t really know what else to add. Yes! I got right company in right moment It’s very similar to Belarus.  Similar food, similar clothes, similar behavior Besides, the language is similar to ours It’s easy to understand Polish because the language is, basically, very much like Russian or Belarusian I feel safer in Poland  And people are very friendly The people in the streets are always smiling. When go for walks with kids, they often get a lot of compliments. The way I see it, relocation fully enabled us to take advantage of everything that modern life has to offer. I came here on a Sunday. It is common knowledge that almost everything is closed on Sundays in Poland. Everything is quire unfamiliar here. Your parents aren’t  here to help out with the kids. In my opinion, finding a place to live is the greatest challenge. Any relocation is about new opportunities. Some experiences are inevitably sad and some are superb, but it is all worth it. When I came it was a hard time.  But now I feel like I’m already feel comfortable The people are in no rush, they take things easy. Compared to Warsaw, I can’t help feeling an amazing serenity here. There is a lot of greenery in the city, lots of parks  Really beautiful ancient architecture  You can have everything that you want,  so if you want shopping mall, you have it  if you want swimming pool, you have it   I like these bike roads   This city gives me opportunities to ride a lot There are lots of travelling opportunities. 5 hours to the sea, 5 hours to the mountains. Great airport I’ve already taken more flights this year than I have in my entire lifetime! I really like the office. It’s like in the city center  It’s close to everything We have a beautiful office. It’s a place you want to be in. It makes your working days more bright Best coworkers and best office in Poznan  This is why I like SOFTSWISS',\n",

       " 'Let me show you around my last trip in Poland.\\xa0 We started visiting Goniadz,\\xa0\\na small town born around the\\xa0\\xa0 railway sector and crossed by the Biebrza river.\\xa0 It has a lovely park with an gazebo equipped\\xa0\\nfor huge barbecues and a very pintoresque and\\xa0\\xa0 funny-shapped sauna.\\nGoniadz\\xa0\\xa0 is surrounded by nature, amongst which vast\\xa0\\nand green wet meadows are definitely the kings,\\xa0\\xa0 extending as far as the eye can see. We then went to Monki, where almost every\\xa0\\nhouse had charming gardens full of either\\xa0\\xa0 flowers or fruits and vegetables.\\nMost of those houses had a very\\xa0\\xa0 characteristic cubic shape.\\nIn some neighbourhoods, the buildings\\xa0\\xa0 were painted in an unique way, with the name of\\xa0\\nthe street and their numbers in a huge format.\\xa0 The public schools were unbelievably\\xa0\\nwell equipped, with running tracks,\\xa0\\xa0 beach-volley courts and much more.\\nAnother captivating thing was the\\xa0\\xa0 edge of the city, which was limited by the\\xa0\\nstart of a leafy forest with gigantic trees. On our second day there, we went to a wedding,\\xa0\\xa0 where we enjoyed local food of great quality\\xa0\\nand I could discover some polish traditions The third day started rainy but,\\xa0\\nfortunately, the sky cleared up quickly,\\xa0\\xa0 so we could do as planned and spend an outdoorsy\\xa0\\nday amongst Podlasie, AKA the lungs of Poland.\\xa0 We visited the Biebrza National Park,\\xa0\\xa0 which has wooden paths that connect\\xa0\\nthe many viewpoints contained in it.\\xa0 From one of those, it\\'s possible to go\\xa0\\noff-track and cross a few fences to get\\xa0\\xa0 a glimpse of what Poland went trough during\\xa0\\nthe last century, a history kept and told by\\xa0\\xa0 the Osowiec Fortress, which witnessed\\xa0\\nmany battles during both World Wars,\\xa0\\xa0 including the famous \"Attack of the Dead Men\".\\nThe landscape was breathtaking and totally\\xa0\\xa0 overtaken by nature by now, but knowing\\xa0\\nthat all those holes and hills were once\\xa0\\xa0 created by bombs and grenades inevitably\\xa0\\nbrought some bitter thoughts to our minds Our next stop was Tykocin. This town has\\xa0\\na castle where battle recreations happen\\xa0\\xa0 yearly to commemorate how it was retaken back\\xa0\\non the 17th century after a Swedish invasion.\\xa0 The city also has an impressive\\xa0\\nre-constructed synagogue hidden\\xa0\\xa0 inside a simple building. Its walls\\xa0\\nare covered in Hebrew inscriptions\\xa0\\xa0 and it hosts an exposition about\\xa0\\nthe Jewish culture and religion.\\xa0 For lunch we went to a dwór, which\\xa0\\nare restaurants in the middle of the\\xa0\\xa0 forest that used to be manor houses of\\xa0\\nPolish nobles. They are usually wooden,\\xa0\\xa0 serve traditional food and\\xa0\\nuse folkloric decoration. We spent our fourth day in Bialystok.\\xa0\\nThere, we visited the Branicki Palace,\\xa0\\xa0 which faces an astonishing French-style garden\\xa0\\nand is surrounded by a huge park filled with\\xa0\\xa0 big trees and wildlife. This palace is the reason\\xa0\\nwhy Bialystok is known as \"the Polish Versailles\".\\xa0 Our next stop was one of the most\\xa0\\neye-catching churches of the city.\\xa0\\xa0 The Saint Roch\\'s church is also a symbol of the\\xa0\\nPolish independence after the first world war,\\xa0\\xa0 since building a church there was denied several\\xa0\\ntimes by the previous tsarist authorities,\\xa0\\xa0 but it was finally done once\\xa0\\nPoland became independent again.\\xa0 Another known landmark of the city\\xa0\\nis the \"Constitution of May 3\" park,\\xa0\\xa0 which has very funny-looking chickens, bears,\\xa0\\nwolves, bisons and many more animals. It also\\xa0\\xa0 contains a military cemetery and is\\xa0\\nmaintained keeping human intervention\\xa0\\xa0 to a minimum.

       " 'Hey travel buddies, we are Kat & Cezary, and we are\\xa0one of the Kiwi.com World Travel Hackers  traveling on a budget. We started traveling by hacking the\\xa0cheapest flight from Warsaw to Baltic countries. We were searching from Poland to either Lithuania, Latvia, or even Estonia. So basically, anywhere in the Baltic countries. Since Kiwi.com offers you the\\xa0cheapest flights, we have found one to Kaunas, Lithuania, just for €15.5 per person. After paying online with our Visa card,  we\\xa0had everything booked and we started our one-month journey by visiting Kaunas. Kaunas has a very beautiful fortress, amazing cultural events along promenade street called Laisves,  on which you can find a unique architecture. Of course, we\\xa0visited the capital city — Vilnius.  Vilnius is one of the oldest capital cities in Northern Europe and has over\\xa050 churches.  As the travel hackers, we know where to find the best deals. In the morning, we had a\\xa0coffee with the traditional candy called \"Surelis\" with yellow cheese from Lithuania — everything\\xa0for €1.39. We tasted Lithuania by drinking Gira, eating dry meat, and a lot of chocolate. And\\xa0also, did you know that one part of the capital Vilnius declared a Republic? That\\'s right! Užupis. The part\\xa0of the town behind the river has own institution written in 18 languages as a memorial, and\\xa0you can also get a stamp to your passport. Lithuania is a small cute\\xa0country, and with Kiwi.com we had to explore one more attraction — t\\'s called\\xa0The Hill of Crosses on the northwest of Lithuania nearby the city Šiauliai. It\\'s\\xa0a beautiful place with a breathtaking atmosphere. The second country we chose is\\xa0Latvia. Again, with Kiwi.com app,  we chose a random flight from Baltic countries back to Poland — and\\xa0the cheapest one was from Riga.  Riga is capital of Latvia. Two days are not enough to explore this European\\xa0hidden gem. Latvia is known for having the world\\'s tallest woman, one of the oldest flags, and Daina\\xa0folk music. As a big travel hack, we encourage you to get to know some local people, hang out with\\xa0them, and feel the local energy. In Riga, we tasted most amazing drinks and food, and we paid\\xa0with our Visa cards.  My favorite in the city was a building with two black cats on the roof — one\\xa0of the iconic symbols of Riga. And, from now on, we will be traveling to Asia. Cannot say much, but our\\xa0next video will be about three layovers. Stay tuned.',\n",
       " 'This is going to be the worst vlog of your\\nlife.\\nI know. I love this... Bread, this thing and this other thing, cucumber? Welcome to Warszawa, Warsaw, with ByKaka. We are going to the cheapest place ever, just\\nbecause... if you would like to have a date with a girl\\nin Poland, you have to bring her to a cheap place! Ahaha, Michele, remember! Now I\\'m gonna get bad comments from Poland. Let\\'s go inside Pijalnia Wodki i Piwa. I always come to such places before going\\nto party at night, $2 - $3 food and $1 alcohol. It\\'s incredible! I read online that this place is inspired\\nby the \\'60s or Poland in the \\'60s. People forget that we speak Polish; I mean,\\nI don\\'t speak it, but... You do, your Polish is great! You need to try \"Vodka taste of nuts\". Yeah... Oh, no! Yes. Yeah, I mean, I will try it, but you know\\nwhat my mom always taught me: not to drink vodka with taste. You know, because in Poland you have all these\\nvodkas... Yeah, but your mother didn\\'t live in Poland\\nfor 30 years, so she\\'s not right anymore. I hope she\\'ll see my vlogs, she will understand\\nshe\\'s not right :) I don\\'t think so! I will send her my video. In Denmark we don\\'t have any vodka with taste,\\nit\\'s just like... I assure you, it\\'s like drinking Nutella. That doesn\\'t really sound good to me. I love Nutella, but... This is what I say to pic up girls: it\\'s just\\nNutella! Another one, another one. This is the place where I would go to have\\na cheap night and drinking before going to the club, because I cannot afford to buy drinks in the clubs  despite making more money than you on YouTube. Looks awesome. I love the atmosphere, I love that they have\\ndone something that... Ohoh. What does it mean? Active like when you rest...\\nhow do you say it? Resting what? Like when you go on a holiday, but it\\'s like\\nan active holiday. Active holiday? It\\' a diss... Okay, I mean... You didn\\'t get the joke though it was way\\nfunnier than all your jokes. If somebody got this joke, please write it\\ndown in the comments. It\\'s basically like a very traditional Polish\\nthing, it\\'s jelly with meat inside, it\\'s very weird, it looks weird... And this one is? What\\'s this dish? Ah, it\\'s fish! It\\'s fish! Oh, it\\'s pretty cool. Herring fish in oil. And then over here we have this pork jelly,\\nwhich I\\'m sure I\\'m not gonna like but  I hope I will be surprised. It tastes weird and it looks weird. it\\'s like this food you in find in motorway restaurants\\nwhen you\\'re driving for a very long time and you need to eat something in the car. This is something they would eat  50 years ago. So all the newspaper here from the 60s probably. Where is the date? Oh yeah, true. Could be. Also these very old drinks... [I read by mistake a bad word in Polish language]\\nI have no idea what I\\'m reading. I read [bad word], I need control myself for\\na moment. Your face... this is gonna be the worst vlog\\nof your life :) I know. But subscribe to her channel, please. So we are currently waiting for the potato\\nto boil, then we are gonna have all the food and we are gonna see which one you should\\nbuy. I would also suggest buying tartar, but it\\'s\\nnot available in the morning apparently. Did we decide what shots we\\'re getting? I told you, you need to try this Nutella shot. How is the water? It\\'s vodka. Pure vodka. Vodka with ice. Never believe half Polish girls! Some people drink beers, some people drink\\npure vodka. This is how we roll. So disappointing for Poland this girl. Actually yesterday you made me drunk because\\nI came and I didn\\'t eat... After two glasses of wine? I was so tipsy! I think it\\'s the time of the truth. I\\'m sure that one is good, this one I\\'m not... This thing is pretty scary. Yeah, that\\'s not appetizing. Yeah that\\'s something I wouldn\\'t eat normally. Look at your face! It\\'s better than what I was expecting. I\\'m not a fan but I could survive a day with\\nthis. The bread is good. It really does not look appetizing. I know, I know. So probably if you break the jelly, you find\\nthe meat. She\\'s going to vomit. Let me try to eat just the meat and here we\\ngo. That\\'s not the point, you\\'re supposed to eat\\nit all. The meat is really good without the jelly. It\\'s fresh, strange. I love that cheese, really. My favorite plate has just arrived, she seems\\nhappy about it. Finally happy about something. Come on! And we did order one last thing... the total\\nof all these dishes... four plates, two shots, one beer and one water, it is 68 PLN / 17 USD You mean one vodka water. In the past, every shot was one dollar, every\\nfood was two dollars; now the food became three dollars but still okay. That\\'s so very affordable, even for Poland\\nthat\\'s also very affordable. Like Warsaw is actually quite expensive, you\\ncan say. so it\\'s getting way more expensive than it\\nused to be. Exactly. So I think the last five-ten years they passed\\nfrom eighth PLN to twelve PLN. But it\\'s okay, inflation. We are printing money! This is gonna be fish, onions... Should be okay.  Yeah, this one is good. Mmm. Try this. So you take a piece of the potato; I took\\nlike a really tiny piece... then you immerge it in an elegant way. How does it feel? It\\'s so good, it\\'s such a good combo. Potato and cheese. This thing is amazing. Really I love this cheese so much. Really, this is so good. Yeah I know, I know. That\\'s what I get every night before/after\\ngetting drunk. Mom, I never said that. How do you say goodbye in Italian? \"Arrivederci\"? You can say simply \"Ciao\". What is \"arrivederci\"? \"Arrivederci\" is goobye, yeah. Oh my God, high five to me. Wow. So everything is served, everything is half-eaten. Apart from this little thing. I\\'m gonna try to take out the meat from the\\njelly. You know this dish is not really popular nowadays. It\\'s just like old-style dishes. It\\'s like when sometimes people want to be\\nnostalgic... I guess  maybe some weirdos like it, nobody\\nknows, but you know. So this is [food name] or whatever. Am I even in this freaking shot? Like why am I even here if I\\'m never in the\\nshot guys, tell me. Because I\\'m tasting (this food) now and then\\nyou will be in the shot. Come on! Girls, never shoot videos with girls. Mmm, it\\'s okay, it\\'s actually good, but to\\nhave it better you need to place two of them over here. And those are sour cucumbers, I think you\\nshould say it. Sour cucumber, okay. She said that those are sour cucumbers. And they\\'re very like a unique thing in Poland. I don\\'t think you eat them anywhere else (in\\nthe world) really. Those are not cornish... They\\'re not pickles. No oh! Okay, I was thinking it\\'s the same thing. I\\'m only half Polish guys, only half. Do you have college citizenship? Yeah. Give it back, you don\\'t deserve it! Let me first have a bite. So when it\\'s all three together I\\'m sure it\\'s\\nten times better. All three together it\\'s perfection. If there is one missing: bread, this thing,\\nand this other thing, cucumber... I\\'m doing some entertainment to make your\\nvideo better :) But for real when... Did you say that the cucumber is sour? I think you said it 100 times... The cucumber is sour, guys. This is not a pickle, it\\'s sour. Okay okay, it\\'s sour. It\\'s sour and very good. Do you know what I love doing? Just eating it like this. Because you\\'re drinking vodka and if you\\'re\\ndrinking vodka as she does, this will absorb alcohol. With a straw. The straw is melting thanks to the alcohol. It\\'s like 60% basically... Polish girls are tough, avoid them. Tougher than half Italian, half polish boys. So is it pickle or is it cucumber? Is it good? Do you like it? With the sour cucumber on top it\\'s really\\ngood. Wiithout it, it\\'s so so. One of the most traditional Danish dishes\\nis like bread with things on top of it. It\\'s called [Danish dish name] and we eat\\nit with fork and knife. Like sometimes you even see people eating\\nlunch at work or school, like a sandwich, with a fork and knife. Danish people are weird. In Africa they say that if you do not eat\\nwith your hands, the food has no taste. I hate eating with my hands because I don\\'t\\nlike getting my hands dirty, I\\'m like this annoying foreigner: even when I was in India and we were eating off like these banana leaves, which traditionally you\\'re supposed to eat\\nwith like your hands, I asked for a fork and knife. Completely a disgrace. At least I know what\\'s the difference between\\na sour cucumber and a pickle, okay? Sorry, I\\'m eating with my hands. I don\\'t even like eating pizza with my hands,\\nI eat pizza with a fork. And if that\\'s not crazy, I don\\'t know what\\ncrazy is. You\\'re a weirdo, but ok. She spent 10 minutes complaining about not\\neating with her hands and then... I wouldn\\'t go that far and say that it\\'s amazing... With the sour thing on the top is much better,\\nwithout it nope. I love this. That\\'s my favorite vodka. Thanks a lot. Okay, we\\'re gonna take this shot now and we\\nhope Michele is not gonna get wasted like he did yesterday after two glasses of wine. 100% wasted. This shot is Nutella, 100% Nutella and some\\nvodka. I\\'m really scared. You spilled it over me! That wasn\\'t the plan. I\\'m really sorry. You see, I was out of Europe for a very long\\ntime, I\\'m not able to drink shots. Spill the shot all over me, cool! It was really good, it\\'s so much better than\\nI expected. Yes, I told you! So guys, now you know: if you have a girl\\nin Poland, buy her Soplica vodka nuts. It\\'s really good, honestly, I\\'m shocked. Almost as good as my pure vodka and I bet people are gonna watch this video and be like she\\'s so tough,\\nshe walks around with a glass of vodka! Polish girls. Vodka with vodka,\\nthat\\'s how I like it. We have a vlogger here. Professional vlogger. Thanks a lot for everything, really. Pijalnia Wodki i Piwa (name of the place). [She repeats the name with\\na better pronunciation] Thanks a lot, byKaja. You\\'re welcome.

       " \"Hello friends! This video will be about\\ncrossing the border between Terespol, Poland and Brest, Belarus on the train. It's actually interesting because when you cross on a train there is a specific procedure. So, the first step when you actually approach the stop the officers come on the train. They check all your documents and they put a stamp that you have exited the European Union This is the first step and it's actually quite easy one. The second step is when you actually enter Belarus when you\\nenter Belarus and there will be the process of getting your documents\\nchecked once again. As you can see we just crossed the river and right there\\nthere will be a checkpoint. And on that checkpoint they gonna check your\\ndocuments again. It's interesting, they took all the documents, they collect all those.\\nThey look at your face and check that it's actually your face. Then they take all those out and probably they go somewhere and stamp those. Then they return back to you,\\nthe whole process takes like 30 to 40 minutes depending a number of people on board. And they actually check all the luggage. Well, not all the luggage but it's their job to check that you are not brining anything illegal. At the same time it looks a bit strange and intimidating at times Anyway, we have arrived at the beautiful city of Brest, Belarus I just wanted to show you around, please take a look Here we are the Brest railway station and as you can see it feels a bit Soviet Even all those trains look a bit soviet There is so much indication of Soviet era here As you can see there is a Lenin monument Lenin passed through this station on his way to immigration - that's why Let's overlook the railway station, here is a war memorial And now we are looking at the park There is a park nearby a railway station and it also feel a bit Soviet but at the same time it's very peaceful, children are walking everywhere It's very clean and beautiful I'm looking around the downtown and as I said - it's very beautiful Some parts of city are very modern, not everything is Soviet For example, this is the alee of lamps. And there are different sculptures in the form of lamps. I have never seen anything like that before I was amazed Unfortunately I didn't had enough time to visit all the city attractions but I just want to show you around. I hope you liked this video.
